San Francisco, CA (USA)

</div>

<p>
We invite you to join Andy Hertzfeld
of <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications
Foundation</a> and Bradley M. Kuhn, Executive Director of
the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> for a
dinner/discussion at 7 PM on August 7 to benefit FSF.
</p>

<p>
Andy Hertzfeld is part of the design and development team at
the <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications
Foundation</a> founded by Mitch Kapor.  Andy was a principal member of
the original Macintosh team, writing much of the original operating
system and user interface toolbox for Apple's revolutionary computer.
He left Apple in 1984 and has since co-founded three innovative
companies: Radius (1986), General Magic (1990) and Eazel (1999).  He
is passionate about making computers easier and more fun to use, and
is convinced that developing and improving free software is the best
way to do that.  He is also a loyal supporter of the Free Software
Foundation.
</p>

<p>
Andy and Bradley will discuss the work of the Free Software Foundation
which focuses primarily on promoting, protecting and preserving Free
Software.  FSF also works to defend the rights of all users of
computer technology &mdash; rights that are harmed by the DMCA and
other similar technology control measures in USA and the European
Union.  Andy and Bradley will discuss the details of this impact.
</p>

<p>
The fund-raising dinner will be held at a restaurant close to the
Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco.  The cost is $125 per
person which includes dinner and
wine.  <a href="http://member.fsf.org/">Associate Members</a> and
representatives of FSF's <a href="http://patron.fsf.org/">Corporate
Patron</a> program will receive a 20% discount to the dinner.
</p>

<p>
This is a fundraising event, all proceeds will go to support the
projects of the Free Software Foundation.  We encourage your to make a
larger donation if you can.
