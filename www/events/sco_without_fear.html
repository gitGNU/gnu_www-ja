<h2>SCO Without Fear</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">The Free Software Foundation
Presents<br />
<br />
<b><big><big>&ldquo;SCO Without Fear&rdquo;</big></big></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">conversations with<br />
<b>Professor Eben Moglen</b></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF)
invites you to a lunch series, &ldquo;<i>SCO Without Fear</i>&rdquo;,
with Professor <a href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/">Eben
Moglen</a>, Board Member and General Counsel to FSF.  During the
series, Prof. Moglen will discuss the SCO Group vs IBM lawsuit and the
implications for the development and use of Free Software of both this
lawsuit and SCO's attacks on the <a href="/licenses/gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</a> (GNU GPL).  The two day lunch series, on
January 20 and 21, will be at Columbia University in New York.</p>

<p>On January 20, Professor Moglen will describe the legal history of
the free software movement from its beginnings in the mind of Richard
Stallman to its current industry-transforming prominence.  His talk
will show how the GNU GPL and other legal measures invented by FSF
proved to be strong enough to bring IBM, HP and other giants of the IT
industry to a full appreciation of free software's technical and
commercial value.  He will then outline the threat SCO's lawsuit
against IBM poses to the legal infrastructure of free software.</p>

<p>On January 21, we will continue the conversation with Professor
Moglen.  He will lay out the strategy of the free software community,
which he has been central in developing, to defeat SCO's phantom case.
Also, he will talk about why he thinks users of free software have
nothing to fear from SCO, their team of lawyers and their $60 million
war chest.  All the SCO lawyers and all of SCO's money will not be
able to blow down the house of GNU/Linux built on the foundation of
the GNU GPL.  Professor Moglen will in addition discuss the
Foundation's plans to strengthen the legal infrastructure in the
aftermath of the inevitable collapse of SCO's lawsuit, including some
discussion of the future of the GPL.</p>

<p>The fee for the two day series is $250 or $150 for one day.  Lunch
is included.  People who have registered for
the <a href="/licenses/NYC_Seminars_Jan2004.html">Free Software
