<h2>Porto, Technological City</h2>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://fsf.org">FSF</a> and
the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/">FSF Europe</a> participated in
this year's <em>Porto, Technological City</em>, an event dedicated to
Free Software in Portugal.  This year's edition was held on October
12th, in a historic old market in the riverfront of the northern
Portuguese city of Porto, an area which has been declared <em>world
heritage</em> by Unesco.</p>

<p>This year the event consisted of an exhibition by Institutions and
Companies that develop and work with Free Software, a GNU/Linux
Installation Party and a series of lectures.  The lectures were held
in a conference room installed in the middle of the bulding, around
which the exhibition booths and a cyber-cafe were set up.</p>

<h3 id="ANSOL">National Association for	Free Software</h3>

<p>Among the highlights of the event was the announcement of the
creation of the &ldquo;<a href="http://ansol.org/">National
Association for Free Software</a>&rdquo; (in Portuguese:
&ldquo;Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional para o Software
Livre&rdquo;), ANSOL.  The announcement was made by a group of free
software advocates who have been working during the last months
towards the participation of Portugal in the recently
created <a href="http://www.fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation
Europe</a>.</p>

<p>The association will be a non-profit organization committed to the
promotion, development, research and study of Computing Freedom and
its socio-political, cultural and technological implications.
A <a href="http://ansol.org/">Web site</a> for the association has
been created, and a first draft of its bylaws has been written.  The
initiative has awakened the interest of free software enthusiasts in
Portugal, who are discussing in
the <a href="http://listas.ansol.org/mailman/listinfo/ansol-geral">
association's mailing list</a> the schedule for the first General
Assembly at which the governing boards will be elected.</p>

<h3 id="FSF-participation">FSF participation</h3>

<p>The vice-president of the FSF, Bradley Kuhn, and the vice-president
of the FSF Europe, Lo&iuml;c Dachary, were the two special
international guests in the event.  Bradley Kuhn gave a talk on
&ldquo;Software Freedom, the GNU Generation and the GNU General Public
License&rdquo; and Lo&iuml;c Dachary spoke on &ldquo;Free Software
Development and Associations Throughout the World&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A booth was set up for the FSF and the FSF Europe.  The event was
also a good opportunity for the founding members
of <a href="#ANSOL">ANSOL</a> to meet and exchange ideas with the
vice-presidents of the Free Software Foundation and the Free Software
Foundation Europe.</p>

<h3 id="government">Free Software and the Portuguese government</h3>

<p>The Portuguese government has taken some important steps in defense
of the Free Software movement in Portugal. The mayor of the city of
Oporto, Nuno Cardoso, has supported the initiative of a group of
Professors and students of the <a href="http://fe.up.pt/">School of
Engineering of the University of Porto</a>, that last year launched
the idea of this event.  <a href="http://www.cm-porto.pt">Porto's City
Hall</a> has provided the organizational infrastructure of the
event.</p>

<p>The Portuguese <a href="http://www.mct.pt/">minister of Science and
Technology</a>, Dr. Mariano Gago, attended the event and in an
interview to the local media talked about the importance of
non-proprietary systems in public administrations throughout Europe
and in the Portuguese school system.  Alberto Martins, the Portuguese
Minister of Public Administration and Reform of the State, delivered a
talk on &ldquo;Technology in the Public Administration and in the
Reform of the State&rdquo;.  Several other public officials were
present, including the president of the School of Engineering of the
University of Porto, Dr. Carlos Costa.</p>
