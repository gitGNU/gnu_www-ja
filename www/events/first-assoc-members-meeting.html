                Eben Moglen, Board Member and General Counsel of FSF
                Professor of Law &amp; Legal History at Columbia Law School

                Foundation General Counsel, Eben Moglen, will discuss the
                future of the GPL, outlining the process for development
                of GPL version 3, and describing the challenges we face in
                making and adopting the next generation GPL.


2:15 - 3:00     The Legacy of Computer Science

                Gerald Jay Sussman, FSF Board Member
                Matsushita Professor of Electrical Engineering       
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology  

                We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in
                transportation, in computation, in communication, and in
                biotechnology.  But the advances that look like giant
                steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast to
                the even bigger steps in the future.  Prof. Sussman will
                present and defend his viewpoint that Computer Science is
                not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to
                do with computers.  The computer revolution is a
                revolution in the way we think and in the way we express
                what we think.
