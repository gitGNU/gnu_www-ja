"invites you to a lunch series, &ldquo;<i>SCO Without Fear</i>&rdquo;, with "
"Professor <a href=\"http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/\">Eben Moglen</a>, "
"Board Member and General Counsel to FSF.  During the series, Prof. Moglen "
"will discuss the SCO Group vs IBM lawsuit and the implications for the "
"development and use of Free Software of both this lawsuit and SCO's attacks "
"on the <a href=\"/licenses/gpl.html\">GNU General Public License</a> (GNU "
"GPL).  The two day lunch series, on January 20 and 21, will be at Columbia "
"University in New York."

"On January 20, Professor Moglen will describe the legal history of the free "
"software movement from its beginnings in the mind of Richard Stallman to its "
"current industry-transforming prominence.  His talk will show how the GNU "
"GPL and other legal measures invented by FSF proved to be strong enough to "
"bring IBM, HP and other giants of the IT industry to a full appreciation of "
"free software's technical and commercial value.  He will then outline the "
"threat SCO's lawsuit against IBM poses to the legal infrastructure of free "
"software."

"On January 21, we will continue the conversation with Professor Moglen.  He "
"will lay out the strategy of the free software community, which he has been "
"central in developing, to defeat SCO's phantom case.  Also, he will talk "
"about why he thinks users of free software have nothing to fear from SCO, "
"their team of lawyers and their $60 million war chest.  All the SCO lawyers "
"and all of SCO's money will not be able to blow down the house of GNU/Linux "
"built on the foundation of the GNU GPL.  Professor Moglen will in addition "
"discuss the Foundation's plans to strengthen the legal infrastructure in the "
"aftermath of the inevitable collapse of SCO's lawsuit, including some "
"discussion of the future of the GPL."
