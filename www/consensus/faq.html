<p><a href="/consensus">GNU/consensus</a> is an umbrella project to
facilitate coordination of free software social networking projects to
encourage freedom, privacy, public space, and decentralization. </p>

<h3>General</h3>

<h4>What are you going to do, concretely?</h4>

<p>Our intent is to bring people around the table, and figure out a
common strategy to reach our common goal: user freedom, and
empowerment through free software.</p>

<p>We believe that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/Main_Page#Compliance_Tests">SWAT</a>
 tests came with good intent, but were a
bit too large a scope, and too specific. We want to propose simpler
tests, that do not impose a pre-defined vision of the business logic
of social networking software, but build on simple concepts, one at a
time.</p>

<p><strong>The starting point is "Hello, world."</strong>, or:
<em>A</em> should send a message to <em>B</em> saying "Hello, world."
We leave to the coders the choice of the technology, and let them
report what they used to achieve this basic inter-operability. In this
first test, we're not interested in all the gory details of identity,
objects, messaging, etc. One baby step at a time. The first step is to
start working together.</p>

<p>In other terms, we want to transition from a barely working
federation, to a complete inter-operable federation, and from there
transition to a fully peer-to-peer implementation. That is an
omni-directional endeavor, and we need to reach a consensus for
that.</p>

<h4>Are you crazy?</h4>

<blockquote>"You're never gonna survive, unless... You get a little
crazy!"</blockquote>

<h4>Where is the code?</h4>

<p>Please have a look at our <a
href="/consensus/stakeholders">Stakeholders</a> page.</p>

<h4>Why do you recommend GPLv3+ and AGPLv3+?</h4>

<p>We want to ensure that every stakeholder invests their energy
knowing that everyone else is working for freedom. We don't
<em>impose</em> the GPL on our partners. Some use <strong>MIT
License</strong>, others the <strong>Apache2 License</strong>. But all
do work for freedom.</p>

<h3>Federation</h3>

<h4>You're promoting federation: isn't it what Faceboogle want?</h4>

<p>We're promoting federation as a transitory state toward true
peer-to-peer social networking. Facebook is monitoring a
<strong>billion</strong> users. They need to <a
href="#funboogle">break free</a>.</p>

<h4>You're promoting OStatus federation: isn't it broken? Why not use
&lt;insert your favorite protocol here&gt;?</h4>

<p>OStatus was a good start. Many prominent free social networking
projects support it. New promising protocols are appearing, such as
<strong>pump.io</strong>, <strong>tent.io</strong>, and new
experiments are made, such as <strong>my-profile-project.org</strong>,
and the <strong>Smallest Federated Wiki</strong>, etc.</p>

<p>We hope they all will be willing to work together to define ways to
inter-operate.</p>

<h4>Isn't federation flawed? How can I trust a commodity server?</h4>

<p>In that sense, yes. You can't trust a server controlled by a third
party. That's why we're looking at peer-to-peer solutions in the long
run, and promote user control of their data, and end-to-end, secure
solutions.</p>

<p>But not all use-cases require that amount of privacy. Federation
makes a lot of sense for affinity groups, public contents, and local
communities. <strong>We don't believe in
one-size-fits-all</strong>.</p>

<p>We're expecting to work with the <strong>Freedom Box
Foundation</strong> to reach a critical mass of users so that
"commodity servers" reach our homes at an affordable price. Obtaining
a legal protection of our own data, for the sake of the constitutional
privacy of our homes, is an integral part of the strategy.</p>

<h3>Fun</h3>

<h4 id="funboogle">What's the problem with Facebook?</h4>

<p>Schr√∂dinger's cat is alive, or dead: nobody knows until an observer
actually <strong>opens</strong> the box. In any case, the cat is never
<strong>free</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Cousin Avi</em>: Open the cat.</p>
  <p><em>Bullet Tooth Tony</em>: What do you <strong>mean</strong>
  "open the cat"?</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>
cat | open
Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to console
</code></pre>
