<h2>Toward a GNU Consensus on Free Software for Social Networking</h2>

<p><a href="/consensus">GNU/consensus</a> is an umbrella project to
facilitate coordination of free software social networking projects to
encourage freedom, privacy, public space, and decentralization. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Over the last decade, we've seen the emergence of centralized
   commercial services for online social networking. These services
   are dedicated to surveillance of their users, and threaten free
   speech, privacy, and the end-to-end Internet. They tend to reduce
   the Internet from a public space to a private platform for
   commercial interests.</p>

<p>Various free software projects aim to provide decentralized
   freedom-respecting alternatives to centralized corporate platforms.
   The GNU/consensus hopes to facilitate these projects' working
   together.</p>

<h3>Free Software</h3>

<p>As part of the GNU Project, GNU/consensus promotes and fosters
   adoption of free software in the field of social networking. Using
   the <a href="/licenses/gpl">GNU General Public License</a>
   and the
   <a href="/licenses/agpl">GNU Affero General Public License</a>,
   developers can dedicate their code permanently to users'
   freedom, and thus ensure it advances the public digital space.</p>

<h3>Social Networking</h3>

<blockquote>Some people conflate social networks, which are the
   aggregate of relationships that humans have, with online social
   network services such as Facebook and, arguably, G+"
<br/>&mdash; <a href="http://www.rheingold.com/about/">Howard Rheingold</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Too often, the term social network is used interchangeably with
   social network services, implying that the services themselves
   provide the social network. But that's plain wrong: the social
   network is a human cultural phenomenon, and a network service
   can at best facilitate it.</p>

<h3>Decentralization</h3>

<p>A centralized service, whether Facebook or its alternatives, is
   expensive; to make money, it needs to monitor its users and sell
   information about them.  Furthermore, states will compel the
   service to hand over the data it collects about its users,
   and laws generally give users few rights over data that they
   have handed over to the service.</p>

<p>Therefore, rather than proposing a more ethical centralized
   service, GNU/consensus aims to encourage decentralized systems.
   Ultimately we hope each user will have a server from which to share
   her own personal information with others as she sees fit, managed
   by free software fully under her own control.</p>

<h3>Interoperability</h3>

<p>Where commercial services embody a one-size-fits-all vision, the
   GNU Consensus project recognizes the diversity of use-cases and
   communities.</p>

<p>Hence it fosters diversity in the approaches to social networking
   support tools.</p>

<h3>Anonymity</h3>

<p>With interoperating free software social networking systems,
   no user will be compelled to provide any particular kind of
   information, whether it be her name, her age, or what country
   she lives in.  It will be up to those she communicates with
   to judge what information she chooses to provide or withhold.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>Hereby we propose an initial roadmap, to be refined in conjunction
   with the participating projects.</p>

<h4>Distributed Networking</h4>

<p>When the technology is ready, it makes sense to restore end-to-end
   communications as the normal way to convey social networking
   activity online.</p>

<p>The <a href="/software/gnunet">GNUnet</a> and <a
href="http://www.secushare.org/">Secushare</a> programs will
eventually serve that purpose, by providing the transport mechanisms
for each device on the network to become a fully-featured social
networking service for its owner.</p>

<h4 id="ostatus">OStatus Federation</h4>

<p>In the meantime, decentralization can occur at community level:
    each community can operate its own server, and federate its
    contents with other communities using the <a href="http://ostatus.org/">OStatus protocols</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, the GNU/consensus project aims at coordinating the evolution of
    these protocols through the active participation of developers
    across projects to achieve complete interoperability for existing
    and upcoming federated resources.</p>

<p>We propose <a href="https://lorea.org/">Lorea</a> as the initial
    model implementation since it provides the most advanced OStatus
    implementation to date. It's readily compatible with <a
    href="http://status.net/">StatusNet</a>, <a
    href="http://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora*</a>, and <a
    href="http://friendica.org/">Friendica</a> implementations.[<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>]</p>

<h4>Other federation protocols</h4>

<p>The GNU Consensus considers OStatus the best current protocol
   for federating social network services, but we will also consider
   other protocols that become available. We invite developers to
   present their developments to the GNU/consensus community for testing
   and feedback.</p>

<h4>Use Cases</h4>

<p>Due to their similarity, free software social networking programs
   face a whole lot of similar use cases. These should be clearly
   defined and tests provided to ease implementation.</p>

<p>But all programs are not equal: some will focus on desktop usage,
   others on mobile devices; some on individual use, others on group
   collaboration; some on always-on-connectivity, others on
   eventually-connected-networks.</p>

<h4>Threat Modeling</h4>

<p>An important part of designing massively interactive programs
   resides in the ability to provide a clear and sensible threat
   model for that program.</p>

<p>As many free software social networking programs encounter similar
   issues, it makes sense to define comparable threat models. We
   encourage projects to use the <a
   href="http://octotrike.org/">TRIKE methodology</a> to define the
   threat model, and will provide tools and resources to do so.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p id="footnote-1"><a href="#ostatus" title="back to the OStatus
section">^</a> This was true before the migration to Elgg 1.8. Now the
federation is a bit broken, and should be fixed in the coming weeks.
