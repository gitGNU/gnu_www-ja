<h2>GNU Testimonials</h2>

<p>
  Free software isn't simply a pastime for programmers; it's a
  productive contributor to people and businesses all over the world.
  From ornamental ribbon makers, to scientific researchers, free
  software aids hundreds of thousands of people in their everyday work.
  Its development continues at blazing speed to fill the insatiable
  needs of users in all types of applications.
</p>

<p>
  The GNU Project has been a major influence on free software
  development for more than a decade, creating a myriad of important
  tools such as robust compilers, powerful text editors, and even a
  fully functional operating system.  The project was started in 1984 by
  MIT programmer Richard Stallman to create a free, Unix-like operating
  environment.  Since then, thousands of programmers have joined in the
  effort to produce free, high quality software which is accessible to
  everyone.

  These testimonials challenge the misconceptions that free software is
  impractical, unreliable, and unsupported.

If you have a testimonial to make about free software, we'd like hear
about it and add it to this page.  Longer, detailed testimonials are
much more useful than short testimonials.  You can email your
testimonials to <a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">&lt;gnu@gnu.org&gt;</a>.</p>
