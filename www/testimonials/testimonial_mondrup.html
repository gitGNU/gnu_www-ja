From: Christian Mondrup 
</p>

<p>
Since the beginning of the '90s, I have been gradually using GNU and other
free software more and more. That is true for my current project, a
database system that manages organ transplant waiting lists. This system is
used by hospital departments in the Scandinavian countries.
</p>

<p>
My environment for developing front-end applications for the relational
database would have been rather poor without the emacs editor.  I use it to
take over the source editing after the screen layout has been generated.
Similarily, the sql-mode package makes it possible to perform immediate
execution and testing of sql statements.  This has been especially
useful.
</p>

<p>
By and by I have used numerous other GNU software packages in my
development and production environments.  These include compilers, shell
interpreters, pagers, text filters, and others.  Among the non-GNU
utilities I frequently use are Larry Wall's perl scripting and reporting
language and Andrew Tridgell's Samba file server.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I must not forget to mention Linus Torvald's unix type kernel.
This, together with a large suite of GNU utilities, makes an inexpensive pc
an invaluable X windows work station. From this workstation, I can access
all the other development and production machines.
