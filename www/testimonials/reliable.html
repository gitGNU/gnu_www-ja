<h2>Free Software Is Reliable</h2>

<p>
Free software has a reputation for reliability throughout the user
community.  Day in and day out, its users expect it to perform with few or
no complications in every type of application:</p>

<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;When my co-workers can't get their proprietary tools to do the
job they need, they frequently come to me.  A recent example was one of
our top programmers trying to track down a bug&hellip;  He tried to
enable exceptions on his commercial development environm ent
(Microsoft's &ldquo;Developer Studio&rdquo;) and was met by constant
crashes of not only his program, but in fact the debugger and his entire
computer.  In frustration he asked me to load the code into gdb (the GNU
debugger).  I had never used floating point exce ptions before, but I
easily determined how to enable them on my [GNU/]Linux system, and gdb
gracefully caught the SIGFPE [exception] moments later.&rdquo;

<p>
In industries like nuclear engineering, companies cannot afford to
compromise reliability in their tools:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;For your information, at JET, the world's foremost research
project for the development of nuclear fusion technologies for
production of electricity, &hellip; GNU software is well used and
appreciated.  GNU Emacs is used almost universally.  GCC/BASH/GAWK and
many others likewise.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;[GNU/]Linux has been extremely reliable.  We are able to run the
primary server unattended in a remote location.  It has never crashed,
despite two occasions when a runaway process exhausted all
memory.&rdquo;

<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;I have never managed to crash GCC in nearly a decade of trying,
and have never had a program break because GCC compiled it wrongly.
Other FSF tools, like GAWK, are used on a daily basis in responding to
new issues as clients present them, and countless utilities like BASH
and the bin-utils operate so reliably that we often forget that they're
there.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We have found GNU software to be better supported and of better
quality than any proprietary software that we've tried.&rdquo;

<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;To mention GNU software, GCC (the GNU C language compiler) was
used to compile software.  No problems, didn't ever give it a thought.
It simply worked.&rdquo;
