<h2>Free Software Is Reliable</h2>

<p>
Free software has a reputation for reliability throughout the user
community.  Day in and day out, its users expect it to perform with few or
no complications in every type of application:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"When my co-workers can't get their proprietary tools to do the job they
need, they frequently come to me.  A recent example was one of our top
programmers trying to track down a bug...  He tried to enable exceptions
on his commercial development environm ent (Microsoft's "Developer
Studio") and was met by constant crashes of not only his program, but in
fact the debugger and his entire computer.  In frustration he asked me to
load the code into gdb (the GNU debugger).  I had never used floating
point exce ptions before, but I easily determined how to enable them on my
[GNU/]Linux system, and gdb gracefully caught the SIGFPE [exception]
moments later."
</p></blockquote>

<p>
In industries like nuclear engineering, companies cannot afford to
compromise reliability in their tools:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"For your information, at JET, the world's foremost research project for
the development of nuclear fusion technologies for production of
electricity, ... GNU software is well used and appreciated.  GNU Emacs is
used almost universally.  GCC/BASH/GAWK and many others likewise."
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"[GNU/]Linux has been extremely reliable.  We are able to run the primary
server unattended in a remote location.  It has never crashed, despite two
occasions when a runaway process exhausted all memory."
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"I have never managed to crash GCC in nearly a decade of trying, and have
never had a program break because GCC compiled it wrongly.  Other FSF
tools, like GAWK, are used on a daily basis in responding to new issues as
clients present them, and countless utilities like BASH and the bin-utils
operate so reliably that we often forget that they're there."

<blockquote><p>
"We have found GNU software to be better supported and of better quality
than any proprietary software that we've tried."
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"To mention GNU software, GCC (the GNU C language compiler) was used to
compile software.  No problems, didn't ever give it a thought.  It simply
worked."
