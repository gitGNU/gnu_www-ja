"ribbon makers, to scientific researchers, free software aids hundreds of "
"thousands of people in their everyday work.  Its development continues at "

"The GNU Project has been a major influence on free software development for "
"more than a decade, creating a myriad of important tools such as robust "
"compilers, powerful text editors, and even a fully functional operating "
"system.  The project was started in 1984 by MIT programmer Richard Stallman "
"to create a free, Unix-like operating environment.  Since then, thousands of "
"programmers have joined in the effort to produce free, high quality software "
"which is accessible to everyone."
