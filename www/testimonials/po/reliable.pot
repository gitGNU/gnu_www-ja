"&ldquo;When my co-workers can't get their proprietary tools to do the job "
"they need, they frequently come to me.  A recent example was one of our top "
"programmers trying to track down a bug&hellip; He tried to enable exceptions "
"on his commercial development environm ent (Microsoft's &ldquo;Developer "
"Studio&rdquo;) and was met by constant crashes of not only his program, but "
"in fact the debugger and his entire computer.  In frustration he asked me to "
"load the code into gdb (the GNU debugger).  I had never used floating point "
"exce ptions before, but I easily determined how to enable them on my "
"[GNU/]Linux system, and gdb gracefully caught the SIGFPE [exception] moments "
"later.&rdquo;"
