"Since the beginning of the '90s, I have been gradually using GNU and other "
"free software more and more. That is true for my current project, a database "
"system that manages organ transplant waiting lists. This system is used by "
"hospital departments in the Scandinavian countries."

"My environment for developing front-end applications for the relational "
"database would have been rather poor without the emacs editor.  I use it to "
"take over the source editing after the screen layout has been generated.  "
"Similarily, the sql-mode package makes it possible to perform immediate "
"execution and testing of sql statements.  This has been especially useful."

"By and by I have used numerous other GNU software packages in my development "
"and production environments.  These include compilers, shell interpreters, "
"pagers, text filters, and others.  Among the non-GNU utilities I frequently "
"use are Larry Wall's perl scripting and reporting language and Andrew "
"Tridgell's Samba file server."

"Of course, I must not forget to mention Linus Torvald's unix type kernel.  "
"This, together with a large suite of GNU utilities, makes an inexpensive pc "
"an invaluable X windows work station. From this workstation, I can access "
"all the other development and production machines."
