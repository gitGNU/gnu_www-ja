"The HIRLAM consortium is a research effort of seven European meteorological "
"services.  In their work with limited area numerical weather forecasting, "
"they use diffutils, RCS, and GNU make as the basis of their source code "
"management.  GNU Fortran and GNU C, along with a Bourne compatible shell "
"like bash are sufficient to compile and run the system."

"The benefit of basing source code management on free tools is the wide "
"portability of them; I have personally used them on systems such as "
"NeXTStep, Cray Unicos, Fujitsu VPP 700, Convex 4610, SGI, and DEC Alpha.  "
"Using GNU make is far simpler than writing makefiles that are portable to "
"different versions of make."
