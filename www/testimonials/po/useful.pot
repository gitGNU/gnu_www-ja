"&ldquo;As you well know, GNU tools are all over the place for the various "
"space missions.  They are used extensively throughout the mission "
"development, test and operations phases.  I wrote the DARTS dynamics "
"simulator for Cassini (spacecraft) several years ago and relied heavily on "
"tools such as GCC, GDB, Emacs, RCS etc.  These and others are in use by many "
"other spacecraft missions including Galileo, Mars Pathfinder, New Millennium "
"etc.  It is my personal belief that the FSF activities and software have "
"been a tremendous source of high quality tools which are readily accessible "
"and usable by the community.&rdquo;"
