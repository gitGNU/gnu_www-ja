"I work on research ships, mainly deep seismic acquisition, but other types "
"as well.  The story I am about to tell is of a single piece of GNU "
"software.  Tar.  For many years we have been using systems with disk stacks "
"containing disks no more than 3 Gb in size, and the application code has "
"facilities to span data across disks.  But for backup, it calls a shell "
"script which calls tar.  And does so on a disk-by-disk basis.  We have been "
"taring to Exabyte 2500 drives, and fortunately no one disk was bigger than "
"would fit on a tar tape."

"The world changes, and things move on.  Because of a monster project last "
"year I was forced to replace several of the disks in the stack with 180Gb "
"ones.  The application code coped, but the backup needed very careful human "
"intervention instead of using the facilities from the "
"application&mdash;because now it was easy to launch a backup that would not "
"fit on one tape."

"The solution? GNU tar.  GNU tar has allowed us to do two things in one go: "
"to split backups across more than one tape, and to connect directly to an "
"IBM 3590 tape drive on another workstation for larger capacity.  This was "
"made possible, too, by the well-written application code whose GUI merely "
"calls a shell script, and by some of the basic modularity of Unix.  But "
"without GNU tar it could not have been done.  A two kilo-euro investment in "
"software, hardware, training, and installtion on the vessel has been rescued "
"from obselescence by me&mdash;with some help from GNU tar."

"GNU tar is an enhanced version of standard Unix tar.  But the enhancements "
"are sensible, and merely looking at the help output one can see that they "
"have been made by practical, experienced, people working with the code they "
"write.  The code is solid, reliable, and achieves exactly what it sets out "
"to do.  And it is familiar enough that anyone can use it."

"How long did it take me to make this astonishing change? Twenty hours to "
"download some binary packages to the vessel.  And around 3 minutes to "
"install them.  Another hour for the changes to the application script, and 6 "
"hours to test. (Have you ever tried writing 8.6GB of data?)."

"I have been using GNU, and GNU/Linux, software for many years: since my days "
"at Rockwell Automation at least, call that 1984.  I just thought it was time "
"to say thank you to the originators of some of the most useful bits of code "
"on the planet."
