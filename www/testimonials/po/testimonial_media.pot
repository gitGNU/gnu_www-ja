"I completely depend on GNU software in my company, which does web design, "
"design/layout for print, and professional music production. For most, if not "
"all, of the image manipulation tasks, I use The GIMP, which is a very "
"powerful, flexible, and quite reliable tool. Furthermore, I use Slackware's "
"distribution of GNU/Linux as an operating system on one of the most "
"important workstations, and it, together with its GNU tools, gives me "
"incredibly reliable performance, not comparable at all with the poorer "
"performance of so-called &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; proprietary operating "
"systems."

"Indeed, I found GNU software on the whole to be much more reliable, "
"light-weight, and flexible than many proprietary counterparts, plus, GNU "
"software is often taylored more towards the scientist, and not the common "
"end-user, which is a definite plus for me."

"I use GNU Window Maker on all of my boxes&hellip; Furthermore, GCC and GDB "
"are used frequently for development of GTK+ applications and for an internal "
"AI (Artificial Intelligence) project, and are both valuable and reliable "
"tools which have never failed so far."
