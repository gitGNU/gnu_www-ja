"<a href=\"/gnu/\">Project GNU</a> urges people working on free software to "
"follow standards and guidelines for universal accessibility on GNU/Linux and "
"other free operating systems.  Multi-platform projects should use the cross "
"platform accessibility interfaces available that include GNU/Linux "
"distributions and the GNOME desktop.  Project GNU also advises developers of "
"web sites to follow the guidelines set forth by the World Wide Web "
"Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative."

"According to the United Nations in 2005, there were 600 million people with "
"disabilities in the world.  To use computers, many of them need special "
"software known as &ldquo;access technology&rdquo;.  Like other programs, "
"these can be free software or proprietary.  Those which are free software <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\"> respect the freedom of their users</a>; "
"the rest, proprietary programs, subject those users to the power of the "
"program's owner.  Programs for accessibility ethically must be free "
"software, like other programs."

"In order for access technology to work, the other software in use must "
"interoperate with it.  The majority of computer programs and web sites (85% "
"in one estimate) do not comply with accessibility standards and guidelines, "
"so they do not work with access technology.  They provide a frustrating "
"experience, and can bar users from job or school activities."

"Proprietary file formats that require proprietary reading programs are "
"poison to both accessibility and to the freedoms that we as free software "
"activists hope to establish.  The biggest offender is Flash format; it "
"usually requires proprietary software that doesn't cooperate with "
"accessibility.  Microsoft Silverlight is similar.  <acronym title=\"Portable "
"Document Format\">PDF</acronym> is also difficult; though there is free "
"software to view it, it does not support free access technology software.  "
"Improving this is an important project."

"People with disabilities deserve to have control of their own technological "
"destinies.  When they use proprietary access technology, they have little or "
"no way to correct whatever is wrong with it.  Virtually all major decisions "
"of the proprietary developers are made by people who do not have the "
"disability; 20 years' experience shows that people with unusual combinations "
"of disabilities, who require relatively unusual software, or who encounter a "
"bug that keeps them from doing their job have no way to obtain the changes "
"they need.  These products are only changed or improved when the vendors see "
"a business reason for doing the work; this leaves many users behind.  As a "
"secondary problem, proprietary access software is far more expensive than a "
"PC.  Many users cannot afford to give up their freedom in this way."

"For users with disabilities, as for all other users, free software is <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html\">the only way the "
"users can control their own computing</a>, their only chance to make "
"software fit their needs rather than passively accepting whatever developers "
"choose to offer them."

"Nations with large populations also have large numbers of people with "
"disabilities.  Countries including Brazil and Russia are discussing whether "
"to standardize government purchases on GNU/Linux platforms.  These nations "
"are all signatories to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with "
"Disabilities, and include technology in their agenda for providing such "
"rights.  This will require them to hire programmers to work on accessibility "
"software for their populations.  If it is free software, the rest of the "
"world will be able to use it too.  The hackers who work on free access "
"technology will provide tools that people with disabilities can use to "
"expand their horizons enormously."
