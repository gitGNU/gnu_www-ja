"Just as we were starting a project, GNUpedia, to develop a free "
"encyclopedia, the <em>Nupedia</em> encyclopedia project adopted the <a "
"href=\"/licenses/fdl.html\">GNU Free Documentation License</a> and thus "
"became a free commercial project.  So we decided to merge GNUpedia project "
"into Nupedia.  Now, the <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a> "
"encyclopedia project has adopted the philosophy of Nupedia and taken it even "
"further.  We encourage you to visit and contribute to the site."
