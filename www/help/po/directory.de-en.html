<h2>Helping with the Free Software Directory</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/">Free Software Directory</a>,
one of the FSF's major initiatives, needs volunteers to improve it.
Here are some ways you can get involved, progressing from simple to
complex.</p>


<h3 id="reporting-errors">Reporting Errors</h3>
<p>
If you note an error in the database, 
please report it by sending email
to <a href="mailto:bug-directory@gnu.org">
&lt;bug-directory@gnu.org&gt;</a>.  Please include the name of the
project and the field that is incorrect.  It would be appreciated if
you could also include the correct information.  However, this isn't
required.  You can also use the &ldquo;file a bug&rdquo; button on the
Directory web pages.
</p>

<h3 id="reporting-releases">Reporting New Releases</h3>
<p>
One piece of information which is especially hard to keep up to date
is the version information.  If you are an author or avid user of a
particular project, please report new releases as above.
</p>

<h3 id="adding-entries">Adding Entries</h3>

<p>To add an entry for a program not already in the database, it is best
to use the <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Form:Submit">web
submission form</a>.  But if you don't want to do that, please provide
as much of the following information as you can via email to <a
href="mailto:bug-directory@gnu.org"> &lt;bug-directory@gnu.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Project title and homepage</li>
<li>Link to the source code</li>
<li>Please list all licenses, including documentation license</li>
<li>A short description of what the program does</li>
<li>Current version and maturity level</li>
<li>Maintainers' names/contact (we will make this info public)</li>
<li>Any help resources or community resources, such as mailing list
    archives, IRC or bug lists</li>
<li>Any developer resources, such as bug reporting lists and public VCS
    checkout command</li>
<li>All known dependencies</li>
<li>Indicate all applicable interface styles:
Command Line, Console, Daemon, X Window, Web, Email</li>
</ol>

<p>To be listed in the Free Software Directory, packages should meet
all of these requirements (we may change the criteria if necessary):</p>

<ol>
<li>The software is at least of beta quality; users consider it usable
and useful.  (We also list GNU packages that are in early development,
but they are marked as not ready for general use.)
</li>
<li>It is licensed under a free software license as defined
in <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">the free software definition</a>
and listed as a <a href="/licenses/license-list.html">free software
license</a>.
</li>
<li>It does not rely on non-free software, either for significant
functionality or normal performance.  (Software which depends on a
non-free platform is not usable in the Free World.)
</li>
<li>It runs on the GNU system or the GNU/Linux system.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Our aim is to list all free software meeting the criteria, but
of course that is a moving target.</p>

<h3 id="participate">Help with Maintenance</h3>

<p>The Free Software Directory is now based on a wiki infrastructure.
Thus, it is now much easier for anyone to help maintain the Directory by
reviewing submitted items, updating stale information, and so on.
Please see the <a
href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate">Free
Software Directory participation</a> page for more.</p>


<p>In whatever form, thanks for your help!</p>
