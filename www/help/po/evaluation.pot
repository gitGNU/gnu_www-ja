"If you can't answer all the questions, or if the program does not perfectly "
"fulfill every item mentioned, don't worry, that does <em>not</em> mean we "
"will blindly reject it.  It's common for a program to be evaluated when it's "
"not quite ready.  If the program is basically good, but certain things are "
"missing, we'll just point out what needs to be added.  We can also evaluate "
"a program at an early stage of development; in that case, we may want to "
"judge your ability to complete the program based on other projects you have "
"already done."

"GNU is not simply a collection of useful programs.  We started the GNU "
"Project with a specific overall goal: to create a free software operating "
"system, the GNU System.  To keep the GNU system technically coherent, we "
"make sure that the parts fit well together.  So the evaluators judge "
"programs based on how well they fit into the GNU system, both technically "
"and philosophically, as well as on their quality, usability, and the other "
"characteristics you would expect.  Based on the evaluators' report, Richard "
"Stallman (the Chief GNUisance)  makes the final decision on whether to "
"accept the contribution."

"Thus, becoming a GNU maintainer is a somewhat formal process, since "

"Here's the explanation, from rms, of what it means for a program to be a GNU "
"package, which also explains at a general level the responsibilities of a "
"GNU maintainer."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Making a program GNU software means that its developers and the GNU project "
"agree that &ldquo;This program is part of the GNU project, released under "
"the aegis of GNU&rdquo;&mdash;and say so in the program."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid "This means that you normally put the program on <code>ftp.gnu.org</code>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This means that the official site for the program should be on "
"<code>www.gnu.org</code>, specifically in "
"<code>/software/PROGRAMNAME</code>.  Whenever you give out the URL for the "
"package home page, you would give this address.  It is ok to use another "
"site for secondary topics, such as pages meant for people helping develop "
"the package, and for running data bases.  (We can make an exception and put "
"the web pages somewhere else if there is a really pressing reason.)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"It means that the developers agree to pay attention to making the program "
"work well with the rest of the GNU system&mdash;and conversely that the GNU "
"project will encourage other GNU maintainers to pay attention to making "
"their programs fit in well with it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Just what it means to make programs work well together is mainly a practical "
"matter that depends on what the program does.  But there are a few general "
"principles.  Certain parts of the GNU coding standards directly affect the "
"consistency of the whole system.  These include the standards for "
"configuring and building a program, and the standards for command-line "
"options.  It is important to make all GNU programs follow these standards, "
"where they are applicable."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Another important GNU standard is that GNU programs should come with "
"documentation in Texinfo format.  That is the GNU standard documentation "
"format, and it can be converted automatically into various other formats.  "
"You can use DocBook or any other suitable format for the documentation "
"sources, as long as converting it automatically into Texinfo gives good "
"results."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If a GNU program wants to be extensible, it should use <a "
"href=\"/software/guile/guile.html\">GUILE</a> as the programming language "
"for extensibility&mdash;that is the GNU standard extensibility package.  For "
"some programs there's a reason to do things differently, but please use "
"GUILE if that is feasible."
msgstr ""

"A GNU program should use the latest version of the license that the GNU "
"Project recommends&mdash;not just any free software license.  For most "
"packages, this means using the GNU GPL."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"A GNU program should not recommend use of any non-free program, and it "
"should not refer the user to any non-free documentation for free software.  "
"The <a href=\"/philosophy/free-doc.html\">campaign for free "
"documentation</a> to go with free software is a major focus of the GNU "
"project; to show that we are serious about it, we must not undermine our "
"position by recommending documentation that isn't free."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Occasionally there are issues of terminology which are important for the "
"success of the GNU project as a whole.  So we expect maintainers of GNU "
"programs to follow them.  For example, the documentation files and comments "
"in the program should speak of GNU/Linux systems, rather than calling the "
"whole system &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, and should use the term &ldquo;free "
"software&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.  Since a GNU program "
"is released under the auspices of GNU, it should not say anything that "
"contradicts the GNU Project's views."

msgid ""
"For a program to be GNU software does not require transferring copyright to "
"the FSF; that is a separate question.  If you transfer the copyright to the "
"FSF, the FSF will enforce the GPL for the program if someone violates it; if "
"you keep the copyright, enforcement will be up to you."

"As the GNU maintainer of the package, please make sure to stay in touch with "
"the GNU Project.  If we come across a problem relating to the package, we "
"need to tell you about it, and to discuss with you how to solve it.  "
"Sometimes we will need to ask you to work with other maintainers to solve a "
"problem that involves using multiple packages together.  This probably will "
"happen less than once a year, but please make sure we can contact you in "
"case it does happen."

"* General Information\n"
"** Do you agree to follow GNU policies?\n"
"   If your program is accepted to be part of the GNU system, it means\n"
"   that you become a GNU maintainer, which in turn means that you will\n"
"   need to follow GNU policies in regards to that GNU program.\n"
"   (Summarized above, see maintainers document for full descriptions.)\n"
"\n"
"** Package name and version:\n"
"\n"
"** Author Full Name &lt;Email&gt;:\n"
"\n"
"** URL to package home page (if any):\n"
"\n"
"** URL to source tarball:\n"
"    Please make a release tarball for purposes of evaluation, whether\n"
"    or not you publicly release it.  If you don't have\n"
"    anywhere to upload it, send it as an attachment.\n"
"\n"
"** Brief description of the package:\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"* Code\n"
"** Dependencies:\n"
"    Please list the package's dependencies (source language, libraries, "
"etc.).\n"
"\n"
"** Configuration, building, installation:\n"
"    It might or might not use Autoconf/Automake, but it must meet GNU\n"
"    standards.  Even packages that do not require compilation\n"
"    must follow these standards, so installers have a uniform way to\n"
"    define target directories, etc.  Please see:\n"
"    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Configuration.html\n"
"    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html\n"
"\n"
"** Documentation:\n"
"    We require using Texinfo (http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/)\n"
"    for documentation, and recommend writing both reference and tutorial\n"
"    information in the same manual.  Please see\n"
"    http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/GNU-Manuals.html\n"
"\n"
"** Internationalization:\n"
"    If your package has any user-visible strings, please make them\n"
"    translatable to other languages using GNU Gettext:\n"
"    http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/\n"
"\n"
"** Security:\n"
"    Please discuss any possible security issues with your package:\n"
"    cryptographic algorithms being used, sensitive data being stored,\n"
"    possible elevation of privileges, etc.\n"
"\n"
"* Licensing:\n"
"   Both the software itself *and all dependencies* (third-party\n"
"   libraries, etc.) must be free software in order to be included in\n"
"   GNU.  In general, official GNU software should be released under the\n"
"   GNU GPL version 3 or any later version, and GNU documentation should\n"
"   be released under the GNU FDL version 1.3 or any later version.\n"
"\n"
"   Please see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html for a\n"
"   practical guide to which licenses are free (for GNU's purposes) and\n"
"   which are not.  Please give specific url's to any licenses involved\n"
"   that are not listed on that page.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"* Similar free software projects:\n"
"   Please explain what motivated you to write your package, and search\n"
"   at least the Free Software Directory (http://www.gnu.org/directory/)\n"
"   for projects similar to yours.  If any exist, please also explain\n"
"   what the principal differences are.\n"
