"<a href=\"/distros/free-distros.html\">Free system distributions</a> are "
"committed to distributing information for practical use&mdash;like software "
"and documentation&mdash;only when it's free. They go through a lot of effort "
"to prevent nonfree materials from getting in&mdash;but a lot of software "
"goes into a distribution, and packages are frequently updated, so it's "
"difficult to check everything. People who help with this verification work "
"by finding and reporting nonfree components in one of these endorsed "
"distributions can be rewarded with GNU Bucks."
