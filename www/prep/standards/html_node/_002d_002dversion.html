<h4 class="subsection">4.7.1 <samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp></h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002d_002dversion_007d-output-57"></a>
The standard <code>--version</code> option should direct the program to
print information about its name, version, origin and legal status,
all on standard output, and then exit successfully.  Other options and
arguments should be ignored once this is seen, and the program should
not perform its normal function.

   <p><a name="index-canonical-name-of-a-program-58"></a><a name="index-program_0027s-canonical-name-59"></a>The first line is meant to be easy for a program to parse; the version
number proper starts after the last space.  In addition, it contains
the canonical name for this program, in this format:

<pre class="example">     GNU Emacs 19.30
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The program's name should be a constant string; <em>don't</em> compute it
from <code>argv[0]</code>.  The idea is to state the standard or canonical
name for the program, not its file name.  There are other ways to find
out the precise file name where a command is found in <code>PATH</code>.

   <p>If the program is a subsidiary part of a larger package, mention the
package name in parentheses, like this:

<pre class="example">     emacsserver (GNU Emacs) 19.30
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the package has a version number which is different from this
program's version number, you can mention the package version number
just before the close-parenthesis.

   <p>If you <em>need</em> to mention the version numbers of libraries which
are distributed separately from the package which contains this program,
you can do so by printing an additional line of version info for each
library you want to mention.  Use the same format for these lines as for
the first line.

   <p>Please do not mention all of the libraries that the program uses &ldquo;just
for completeness&rdquo;&mdash;that would produce a lot of unhelpful clutter. 
Please mention library version numbers only if you find in practice that
they are very important to you in debugging.

   <p>The following line, after the version number line or lines, should be a
copyright notice.  If more than one copyright notice is called for, put
each on a separate line.

   <p>Next should follow a line stating the license, preferably using one of
abbreviations below, and a brief statement that the program is free
software, and that users are free to copy and change it.  Also mention
that there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by law.  See
recommended wording below.

   <p>It is ok to finish the output with a list of the major authors of the
program, as a way of giving credit.

   <p>Here's an example of output that follows these rules:

<pre class="smallexample">     GNU hello 2.3
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;
     This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
     There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
</pre>
   <p>You should adapt this to your program, of course, filling in the proper
year, copyright holder, name of program, and the references to
distribution terms, and changing the rest of the wording as necessary.

   <p>This copyright notice only needs to mention the most recent year in
which changes were made&mdash;there's no need to list the years for previous
versions' changes.  You don't have to mention the name of the program in
these notices, if that is inconvenient, since it appeared in the first
line.  (The rules are different for copyright notices in source files;
see <a href="../maintain/Copyright-Notices.html#Copyright-Notices">Copyright Notices</a>.)

   <p>Translations of the above lines must preserve the validity of the
copyright notices (see <a href="Internationalization.html#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>).  If the translation's
character set supports it, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(C)</span></samp>&rsquo; should be replaced with the
copyright symbol, as follows:

   <p>&copy;

   <p>Write the word &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; exactly like that, in English.  Do not
translate it into another language.  International treaties recognize
the English word &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo;; translations into other languages do not
have legal significance.

   <p>Finally, here is the table of our suggested license abbreviations. 
Any abbreviation can be followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v</span><var>version</var><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning
that particular version, or later versions with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, as shown
above.

   <p>In the case of exceptions for extra permissions with the GPL, we use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; for a separator; the version number can follow the license
abbreviation as usual, as in the examples below.
