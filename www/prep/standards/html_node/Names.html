<h3 class="section">5.4 Naming Variables, Functions, and Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-names-of-variables_002c-functions_002c-and-files-98"></a>The names of global variables and functions in a program serve as
comments of a sort.  So don't choose terse names&mdash;instead, look for
names that give useful information about the meaning of the variable or
function.  In a GNU program, names should be English, like other
comments.

   <p>Local variable names can be shorter, because they are used only within
one context, where (presumably) comments explain their purpose.

   <p>Try to limit your use of abbreviations in symbol names.  It is ok to
make a few abbreviations, explain what they mean, and then use them
frequently, but don't use lots of obscure abbreviations.

   <p>Please use underscores to separate words in a name, so that the Emacs
word commands can be useful within them.  Stick to lower case; reserve
upper case for macros and <code>enum</code> constants, and for name-prefixes
that follow a uniform convention.

   <p>For example, you should use names like <code>ignore_space_change_flag</code>;
don't use names like <code>iCantReadThis</code>.

   <p>Variables that indicate whether command-line options have been
specified should be named after the meaning of the option, not after
the option-letter.  A comment should state both the exact meaning of
the option and its letter.  For example,

<pre class="example">     /* Ignore changes in horizontal whitespace (-b).  */
     int ignore_space_change_flag;
</pre>
   <p>When you want to define names with constant integer values, use
<code>enum</code> rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#define</span></samp>&rsquo;.  GDB knows about enumeration
constants.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dname-limitations-99"></a><a name="index-doschk-100"></a>You might want to make sure that none of the file names would conflict
if the files were loaded onto an MS-DOS file system which shortens the
names.  You can use the program <code>doschk</code> to test for this.

   <p>Some GNU programs were designed to limit themselves to file names of 14
characters or less, to avoid file name conflicts if they are read into
older System V systems.  Please preserve this feature in the existing
GNU programs that have it, but there is no need to do this in new GNU
programs.  <code>doschk</code> also reports file names longer than 14
characters.
