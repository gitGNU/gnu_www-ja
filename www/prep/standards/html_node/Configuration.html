<h3 class="section">7.1 How Configuration Should Work</h3>

<p><a name="index-program-configuration-142"></a>
<a name="index-configure-143"></a>Each GNU distribution should come with a shell script named
<code>configure</code>.  This script is given arguments which describe the
kind of machine and system you want to compile the program for. 
The <code>configure</code> script must record the configuration options so
that they affect compilation.

   <p>The description here is the specification of the interface for the
<code>configure</code> script in GNU packages.  Many packages implement it
using GNU Autoconf (see <a href="../autoconf/index.html#Top">Introduction</a>)
and/or GNU Automake (see <a href="../automake/index.html#Top">Introduction</a>),
but you do not have to use these tools.  You can implement it any way
you like; for instance, by making <code>configure</code> be a wrapper around
a completely different configuration system.

   <p>Another way for the <code>configure</code> script to operate is to make a
link from a standard name such as <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> to the proper
configuration file for the chosen system.  If you use this technique,
the distribution should <em>not</em> contain a file named
<samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp>.  This is so that people won't be able to build the
program without configuring it first.

   <p>Another thing that <code>configure</code> can do is to edit the Makefile.  If
you do this, the distribution should <em>not</em> contain a file named
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.  Instead, it should include a file <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> which
contains the input used for editing.  Once again, this is so that people
won't be able to build the program without configuring it first.

   <p>If <code>configure</code> does write the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>, then <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>
should have a target named <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> which causes <code>configure</code>
to be rerun, setting up the same configuration that was set up last
time.  The files that <code>configure</code> reads should be listed as
dependencies of <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.

   <p>All the files which are output from the <code>configure</code> script should
have comments at the beginning explaining that they were generated
automatically using <code>configure</code>.  This is so that users won't think
of trying to edit them by hand.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script should write a file named <samp><span class="file">config.status</span></samp>
which describes which configuration options were specified when the
program was last configured.  This file should be a shell script which,
if run, will recreate the same configuration.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script should accept an option of the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir=</span><var>dirname</var></samp>&rsquo; to specify the directory where sources are found
(if it is not the current directory).  This makes it possible to build
the program in a separate directory, so that the actual source directory
is not modified.

   <p>If the user does not specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir</span></samp>&rsquo;, then <code>configure</code> should
check both <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp> to see if it can find the sources.  If
it finds the sources in one of these places, it should use them from
there.  Otherwise, it should report that it cannot find the sources, and
should exit with nonzero status.

   <p>Usually the easy way to support &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--srcdir</span></samp>&rsquo; is by editing a
definition of <code>VPATH</code> into the Makefile.  Some rules may need to
refer explicitly to the specified source directory.  To make this
possible, <code>configure</code> can add to the Makefile a variable named
<code>srcdir</code> whose value is precisely the specified directory.

   <p>In addition, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; script should take options
corresponding to most of the standard directory variables
(see <a href="Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables">Directory Variables</a>).  Here is the list:

<pre class="example">     --prefix --exec-prefix --bindir --sbindir --libexecdir --sysconfdir
     --sharedstatedir --localstatedir --libdir --includedir --oldincludedir
     --datarootdir --datadir --infodir --localedir --mandir --docdir
     --htmldir --dvidir --pdfdir --psdir
</pre>
   <p>The <code>configure</code> script should also take an argument which specifies the
type of system to build the program for.  This argument should look like
this:

<pre class="example">     <var>cpu</var>-<var>company</var>-<var>system</var>
</pre>
   <p>For example, an Athlon-based GNU/Linux system might be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i686-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script needs to be able to decode all plausible
alternatives for how to describe a machine.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">athlon-pc-gnu/linux</span></samp>&rsquo; would be a valid alias.  There is a shell
script called
<a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD"><samp><span class="file">config.sub</span></samp></a> that you can use as a subroutine to validate system
types and canonicalize aliases.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script should also take the option
<samp><span class="option">--build=</span><var>buildtype</var></samp>, which should be equivalent to a
plain <var>buildtype</var> argument.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure
--build=i686-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure
i686-pc-linux-gnu</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When the build type is not specified by an option
or argument, the <code>configure</code> script should normally guess it using
the shell script
<a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD"><samp><span class="file">config.guess</span></samp></a>.

   <p><a name="index-optional-features_002c-configure_002dtime-144"></a>Other options are permitted to specify in more detail the software
or hardware present on the machine, to include or exclude optional parts
of the package, or to adjust the name of some tools or arguments to them:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-</span><var>feature</var><span class="samp">[=</span><var>parameter</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Configure the package to build and install an optional user-level
facility called <var>feature</var>.  This allows users to choose which
optional features to include.  Giving an optional <var>parameter</var> of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo; should omit <var>feature</var>, if it is built by default.

     <p>No &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable</span></samp>&rsquo; option should <strong>ever</strong> cause one feature to
replace another.  No &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable</span></samp>&rsquo; option should ever substitute one
useful behavior for another useful behavior.  The only proper use for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable</span></samp>&rsquo; is for questions of whether to build part of the program
or exclude it.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with-</span><var>package</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd><!-- @r{[}=@var{parameter}@r{]} -->
The package <var>package</var> will be installed, so configure this package
to work with <var>package</var>.

     <!-- Giving an optional @var{parameter} of -->
     <!-- @samp{no} should omit @var{package}, if it is used by default. -->
     <p>Possible values of <var>package</var> include
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu-as</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gas</span></samp>&rsquo;), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu-ld</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu-libc</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gdb</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x-toolkit</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Do not use a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with</span></samp>&rsquo; option to specify the file name to use to
find certain files.  That is outside the scope of what &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with</span></samp>&rsquo;
options are for.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>variable</var><span class="samp">=</span><var>value</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Set the value of the variable <var>variable</var> to <var>value</var>.  This is
used to override the default values of commands or arguments in the
build process.  For example, the user could issue &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure
CFLAGS=-g CXXFLAGS=-g</span></samp>&rsquo; to build with debugging information and without
the default optimization.

     <p>Specifying variables as arguments to <code>configure</code>, like this:
     <pre class="example">          ./configure CC=gcc
</pre>
     <p>is preferable to setting them in environment variables:
     <pre class="example">          CC=gcc ./configure
</pre>
     <p>as it helps to recreate the same configuration later with
<samp><span class="file">config.status</span></samp>.  However, both methods should be supported. 
</dl>

   <p>All <code>configure</code> scripts should accept all of the &ldquo;detail&rdquo;
options and the variable settings, whether or not they make any
difference to the particular package at hand.  In particular, they
should accept any option that starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with-</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is so users will be able to configure an
entire GNU source tree at once with a single set of options.

   <p>You will note that the categories &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--with-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-</span></samp>&rsquo;
are narrow: they <strong>do not</strong> provide a place for any sort of option
you might think of.  That is deliberate.  We want to limit the possible
configuration options in GNU software.  We do not want GNU programs to
have idiosyncratic configuration options.

   <p>Packages that perform part of the compilation process may support
cross-compilation.  In such a case, the host and target machines for the
program may be different.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script should normally treat the specified type of
system as both the host and the target, thus producing a program which
works for the same type of machine that it runs on.

   <p>To compile a program to run on a host type that differs from the build
type, use the configure option <samp><span class="option">--host=</span><var>hosttype</var></samp>, where
<var>hosttype</var> uses the same syntax as <var>buildtype</var>.  The host type
normally defaults to the build type.

   <p>To configure a cross-compiler, cross-assembler, or what have you, you
should specify a target different from the host, using the configure
option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--target=</span><var>targettype</var></samp>&rsquo;.  The syntax for
<var>targettype</var> is the same as for the host type.  So the command would
look like this:

<pre class="example">     ./configure --host=<var>hosttype</var> --target=<var>targettype</var>
</pre>
   <p>The target type normally defaults to the host type. 
Programs for which cross-operation is not meaningful need not accept the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--target</span></samp>&rsquo; option, because configuring an entire operating system for
cross-operation is not a meaningful operation.

   <p>Some programs have ways of configuring themselves automatically.  If
your program is set up to do this, your <code>configure</code> script can simply
ignore most of its arguments.
