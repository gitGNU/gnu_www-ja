<h3 class="section">4.8 Standards for Dynamic Plug-in Interfaces</h3>

<p><a name="index-plug_002dins-63"></a><a name="index-dynamic-plug_002dins-64"></a>
Another aspect of keeping free programs free is encouraging
development of free plug-ins, and discouraging development of
proprietary plug-ins.  Many GNU programs will not have anything like
plug-ins at all, but those that do should follow these
practices.

   <p>First, the general plug-in architecture design should closely tie the
plug-in to the original code, such that the plug-in and the base
program are parts of one extended program.  For GCC, for example,
plug-ins receive and modify GCC's internal data structures, and so
clearly form an extended program with the base GCC.

   <p><a name="index-plugin_005fis_005fGPL_005fcompatible-65"></a>Second, you should require plug-in developers to affirm that their
plug-ins are released under an appropriate license.  This should be
enforced with a simple programmatic check.  For GCC, again for
example, a plug-in must define the global symbol
<code>plugin_is_GPL_compatible</code>, thus asserting that the plug-in is
released under a GPL-compatible license (see <a href="../gccint/Plugins.html#Plugins">Plugins</a>).

   <p>By adding this check to your program you are not creating a new legal
requirement.  The GPL itself requires plug-ins to be free software,
licensed compatibly.  As long as you have followed the first rule above
to keep plug-ins closely tied to your original program, the GPL and AGPL
already require those plug-ins to be released under a compatible
license.  The symbol definition in the plug-in&mdash;or whatever equivalent
works best in your program&mdash;makes it harder for anyone who might
distribute proprietary plug-ins to legally defend themselves.  If a case
about this got to court, we can point to that symbol as evidence that
the plug-in developer understood that the license had this requirement.
