<h4 class="subsection">6.8.1 Change Log Concepts</h4>

<p>You can think of the change log as a conceptual &ldquo;undo list&rdquo; which
explains how earlier versions were different from the current version. 
People can see the current version; they don't need the change log
to tell them what is in it.  What they want from a change log is a
clear explanation of how the earlier version differed.

   <p>The change log file is normally called <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> and covers an
entire directory.  Each directory can have its own change log, or a
directory can use the change log of its parent directory&mdash;it's up to
you.

   <p>Another alternative is to record change log information with a version
control system such as RCS or CVS.  This can be converted automatically
to a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file using <code>rcs2log</code>; in Emacs, the command
<kbd>C-x v a</kbd> (<code>vc-update-change-log</code>) does the job.

   <p>There's no need to describe the full purpose of the changes or how
they work together.  However, sometimes it is useful to write one line
to describe the overall purpose of a change or a batch of changes.  If
you think that a change calls for explanation, you're probably right. 
Please do explain it&mdash;but please put the full explanation in comments
in the code, where people will see it whenever they see the code.  For
example, &ldquo;New function&rdquo; is enough for the change log when you add a
function, because there should be a comment before the function
definition to explain what it does.

   <p>In the past, we recommended not mentioning changes in non-software
files (manuals, help files, etc.) in change logs.  However, we've been
advised that it is a good idea to include them, for the sake of
copyright records.

   <p>The easiest way to add an entry to <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> is with the Emacs
command <kbd>M-x add-change-log-entry</kbd>.  An entry should have an
asterisk, the name of the changed file, and then in parentheses the name
of the changed functions, variables or whatever, followed by a colon. 
Then describe the changes you made to that function or variable.
