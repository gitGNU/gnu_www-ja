<h3 class="section">7.3 Making Releases</h3>
<a name="index-packaging"></a>

<a name="index-version-numbers_002c-for-releases"></a>
<p>You should identify each release with a pair of version numbers, a
major version and a minor.  We have no objection to using more than
two numbers, but it is very unlikely that you really need them.
</p>
<p>Package the distribution of <code>Foo version 69.96</code> up in a gzipped tar
file with the name <samp>foo-69.96.tar.gz</samp>.  It should unpack into a
subdirectory named <samp>foo-69.96</samp>.
</p>
<p>Building and installing the program should never modify any of the files
contained in the distribution.  This means that all the files that form
part of the program in any way must be classified into <em>source
files</em> and <em>non-source files</em>.  Source files are written by humans
and never changed automatically; non-source files are produced from
source files by programs under the control of the Makefile.
</p>
<a name="index-README-file"></a>
<p>The distribution should contain a file named <samp>README</samp> with a
general overview of the package:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the name of the package;

</li><li> the version number of the package, or refer to where in the
package the version can be found;

</li><li> a general description of what the package does;

</li><li> a reference to the file <samp>INSTALL</samp>, which
should in turn contain an explanation of the installation procedure;

</li><li> a brief explanation of any unusual top-level directories or
files, or other hints for readers to find their way around the source;

</li><li> a reference to the file which contains the copying conditions.
The GNU GPL, if used, should be in a file called <samp>COPYING</samp>.  If
the GNU LGPL is used, it should be in a file called
<samp>COPYING.LESSER</samp>.
</li></ul>

<p>Naturally, all the source files must be in the distribution.  It is
okay to include non-source files in the distribution along with the
source files they are generated from, provided they are up-to-date
with the source they are made from, and machine-independent, so that
normal building of the distribution will never modify them.  We
commonly include non-source files produced by Autoconf, Automake,
Bison, <code>flex</code>, TeX, and <code>makeinfo</code>; this helps avoid
unnecessary dependencies between our distributions, so that users can
install whichever versions of whichever packages they like.  Do not
induce new dependencies on other software lightly.
</p>
<p>Non-source files that might actually be modified by building and
installing the program should <strong>never</strong> be included in the
distribution.  So if you do distribute non-source files, always make
sure they are up to date when you make a new distribution.
</p>
<p>Make sure that all the files in the distribution are world-readable, and
that directories are world-readable and world-searchable (octal mode 755).
We used to recommend that all directories in the distribution also be
world-writable (octal mode 777), because ancient versions of <code>tar</code>
would otherwise not cope when extracting the archive as an unprivileged
user.  That can easily lead to security issues when creating the archive,
however, so now we recommend against that.
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t include any symbolic links in the distribution itself.  If the tar
file contains symbolic links, then people cannot even unpack it on
systems that don&rsquo;t support symbolic links.  Also, don&rsquo;t use multiple
names for one file in different directories, because certain file
systems cannot handle this and that prevents unpacking the
distribution.
</p>
<p>Try to make sure that all the file names will be unique on MS-DOS.  A
name on MS-DOS consists of up to 8 characters, optionally followed by a
period and up to three characters.  MS-DOS will truncate extra
characters both before and after the period.  Thus,
<samp>foobarhacker.c</samp> and <samp>foobarhacker.o</samp> are not ambiguous; they
are truncated to <samp>foobarha.c</samp> and <samp>foobarha.o</samp>, which are
distinct.
</p>
<a name="index-texinfo_002etex_002c-in-a-distribution"></a>
<p>Include in your distribution a copy of the <samp>texinfo.tex</samp> you used
to test print any <samp>*.texinfo</samp> or <samp>*.texi</samp> files.
</p>
<p>Likewise, if your program uses small GNU software packages like regex,
getopt, obstack, or termcap, include them in the distribution file.
Leaving them out would make the distribution file a little smaller at
the expense of possible inconvenience to a user who doesn&rsquo;t know what
other files to get.
