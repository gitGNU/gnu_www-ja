<h3 class="section">4.1 Non-GNU Standards</h3>

<p>The GNU Project regards standards published by other organizations as
suggestions, not orders.  We consider those standards, but we do not
&ldquo;obey&rdquo; them.  In developing a GNU program, you should implement
an outside standard's specifications when that makes the GNU system
better overall in an objective sense.  When it doesn't, you shouldn't.

   <p>In most cases, following published standards is convenient for
users&mdash;it means that their programs or scripts will work more
portably.  For instance, GCC implements nearly all the features of
Standard C as specified by that standard.  C program developers would
be unhappy if it did not.  And GNU utilities mostly follow
specifications of POSIX.2; shell script writers and users would be
unhappy if our programs were incompatible.

   <p>But we do not follow either of these specifications rigidly, and there
are specific points on which we decided not to follow them, so as to
make the GNU system better for users.

   <p>For instance, Standard C says that nearly all extensions to C are
prohibited.  How silly!  GCC implements many extensions, some of which
were later adopted as part of the standard.  If you want these
constructs to give an error message as &ldquo;required&rdquo; by the standard,
you must specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--pedantic</span></samp>&rsquo;, which was implemented only so that
we can say &ldquo;GCC is a 100% implementation of the standard&rdquo;, not
because there is any reason to actually use it.

   <p>POSIX.2 specifies that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">df</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">du</span></samp>&rsquo; must output sizes by
default in units of 512 bytes.  What users want is units of 1k, so
that is what we do by default.  If you want the ridiculous behavior
&ldquo;required&rdquo; by POSIX, you must set the environment variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span></samp>&rsquo; (which was originally going to be named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">POSIX_ME_HARDER</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>GNU utilities also depart from the letter of the POSIX.2 specification
when they support long-named command-line options, and intermixing
options with ordinary arguments.  This minor incompatibility with
POSIX is never a problem in practice, and it is very useful.

   <p>In particular, don't reject a new feature, or remove an old one,
merely because a standard says it is &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; or &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo;.
