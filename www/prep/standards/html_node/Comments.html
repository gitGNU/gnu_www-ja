<h3 class="section">5.2 Commenting Your Work</h3>

<p><a name="index-commenting-86"></a>
Every program should start with a comment saying briefly what it is for. 
Example: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fmt - filter for simple filling of text</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This comment
should be at the top of the source file containing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">main</span></samp>&rsquo;
function of the program.

   <p>Also, please write a brief comment at the start of each source file,
with the file name and a line or two about the overall purpose of the
file.

   <p>Please write the comments in a GNU program in English, because English
is the one language that nearly all programmers in all countries can
read.  If you do not write English well, please write comments in
English as well as you can, then ask other people to help rewrite them. 
If you can't write comments in English, please find someone to work with
you and translate your comments into English.

   <p>Please put a comment on each function saying what the function does,
what sorts of arguments it gets, and what the possible values of
arguments mean and are used for.  It is not necessary to duplicate in
words the meaning of the C argument declarations, if a C type is being
used in its customary fashion.  If there is anything nonstandard about
its use (such as an argument of type <code>char *</code> which is really the
address of the second character of a string, not the first), or any
possible values that would not work the way one would expect (such as,
that strings containing newlines are not guaranteed to work), be sure
to say so.

   <p>Also explain the significance of the return value, if there is one.

   <p>Please put two spaces after the end of a sentence in your comments, so
that the Emacs sentence commands will work.  Also, please write
complete sentences and capitalize the first word.  If a lower-case
identifier comes at the beginning of a sentence, don't capitalize it! 
Changing the spelling makes it a different identifier.  If you don't
like starting a sentence with a lower case letter, write the sentence
differently (e.g., &ldquo;The identifier lower-case is <small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo;).

   <p>The comment on a function is much clearer if you use the argument
names to speak about the argument values.  The variable name itself
should be lower case, but write it in upper case when you are speaking
about the value rather than the variable itself.  Thus, &ldquo;the inode
number NODE_NUM&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;an inode&rdquo;.

   <p>There is usually no purpose in restating the name of the function in
the comment before it, because readers can see that for themselves. 
There might be an exception when the comment is so long that the function
itself would be off the bottom of the screen.

   <p>There should be a comment on each static variable as well, like this:

<pre class="example">     /* Nonzero means truncate lines in the display;
        zero means continue them.  */
     int truncate_lines;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-conditionals_002c-comments-for-87"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023endif_007d_002c-commenting-88"></a>Every &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#endif</span></samp>&rsquo; should have a comment, except in the case of short
conditionals (just a few lines) that are not nested.  The comment should
state the condition of the conditional that is ending, <em>including
its sense</em>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#else</span></samp>&rsquo; should have a comment describing the condition
<em>and sense</em> of the code that follows.  For example:

<pre class="example">     #ifdef foo
       ...
     #else /* not foo */
       ...
     #endif /* not foo */
     #ifdef foo
       ...
     #endif /* foo */
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but, by contrast, write the comments this way for a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#ifndef</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="example">     #ifndef foo
       ...
     #else /* foo */
       ...
     #endif /* foo */
     #ifndef foo
       ...
     #endif /* not foo */
</pre>
   </body></html>
