<h3 class="section">6.1 GNU Manuals</h3>

<p>The preferred document format for the GNU system is the Texinfo
formatting language.  Every GNU package should (ideally) have
documentation in Texinfo both for reference and for learners.  Texinfo
makes it possible to produce a good quality formatted book, using
TeX, and to generate an Info file.  It is also possible to generate
HTML output from Texinfo source.  See the Texinfo manual, either the
hardcopy, or the on-line version available through <code>info</code> or the
Emacs Info subsystem (<kbd>C-h i</kbd>).
</p>
<p>Nowadays some other formats such as Docbook and Sgmltexi can be
converted automatically into Texinfo.  It is ok to produce the Texinfo
documentation by conversion this way, as long as it gives good results.
</p>
<p>Make sure your manual is clear to a reader who knows nothing about the
topic and reads it straight through.  This means covering basic topics
at the beginning, and advanced topics only later.  This also means
defining every specialized term when it is first used.
</p>
<p>Programmers tend to carry over the structure of the program as the
structure for its documentation.  But this structure is not
necessarily good for explaining how to use the program; it may be
irrelevant and confusing for a user.
</p>
<p>Instead, the right way to structure documentation is according to the
concepts and questions that a user will have in mind when reading it.
This principle applies at every level, from the lowest (ordering
sentences in a paragraph) to the highest (ordering of chapter topics
within the manual).  Sometimes this structure of ideas matches the
structure of the implementation of the software being documented&mdash;but
often they are different.  An important part of learning to write good
documentation is to learn to notice when you have unthinkingly
structured the documentation like the implementation, stop yourself,
and look for better alternatives.
</p>
<p>For example, each program in the GNU system probably ought to be
documented in one manual; but this does not mean each program should
have its own manual.  That would be following the structure of the
implementation, rather than the structure that helps the user
understand.
</p>
<p>Instead, each manual should cover a coherent <em>topic</em>.  For example,
instead of a manual for <code>diff</code> and a manual for <code>diff3</code>, we
have one manual for &ldquo;comparison of files&rdquo; which covers both of those
programs, as well as <code>cmp</code>.  By documenting these programs
together, we can make the whole subject clearer.
</p>
<p>The manual which discusses a program should certainly document all of
the program&rsquo;s command-line options and all of its commands.  It should
give examples of their use.  But don&rsquo;t organize the manual as a list
of features.  Instead, organize it logically, by subtopics.  Address
the questions that a user will ask when thinking about the job that
the program does.  Don&rsquo;t just tell the reader what each feature can
do&mdash;say what jobs it is good for, and show how to use it for those
jobs.  Explain what is recommended usage, and what kinds of usage
users should avoid.
</p>
<p>In general, a GNU manual should serve both as tutorial and reference.
It should be set up for convenient access to each topic through Info,
and for reading straight through (appendixes aside).  A GNU manual
should give a good introduction to a beginner reading through from the
start, and should also provide all the details that hackers want.
The Bison manual is a good example of this&mdash;please take a look at it
to see what we mean.
</p>
<p>That is not as hard as it first sounds.  Arrange each chapter as a
logical breakdown of its topic, but order the sections, and write their
text, so that reading the chapter straight through makes sense.  Do
likewise when structuring the book into chapters, and when structuring a
section into paragraphs.  The watchword is, <em>at each point, address
the most fundamental and important issue raised by the preceding text.</em>
</p>
<p>If necessary, add extra chapters at the beginning of the manual which
are purely tutorial and cover the basics of the subject.  These provide
the framework for a beginner to understand the rest of the manual.  The
Bison manual provides a good example of how to do this.
</p>
<p>To serve as a reference, a manual should have an Index that lists all
the functions, variables, options, and important concepts that are
part of the program.  One combined Index should do for a short manual,
but sometimes for a complex package it is better to use multiple
indices.  The Texinfo manual includes advice on preparing good index
entries, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Index-Entries.html#Index-Entries">Making Index Entries</a> in <cite>GNU
Texinfo</cite>, and see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Indexing-Commands.html#Indexing-Commands">Defining the Entries of an
Index</a> in <cite>GNU Texinfo</cite>.
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use Unix man pages as a model for how to write GNU documentation;
most of them are terse, badly structured, and give inadequate
explanation of the underlying concepts.  (There are, of course, some
exceptions.)  Also, Unix man pages use a particular format which is
different from what we use in GNU manuals.
</p>
<p>Please include an email address in the manual for where to report
bugs <em>in the text of the manual</em>.
</p>
<p>Please do not use the term &ldquo;pathname&rdquo; that is used in Unix
documentation; use &ldquo;file name&rdquo; (two words) instead.  We use the term
&ldquo;path&rdquo; only for search paths, which are lists of directory names.
</p>
<p>Please do not use the term &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; to refer to erroneous input to
a computer program.  Please use &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; for this, and reserve the
term &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; for activities prohibited by law.
</p>
<p>Please do not write &lsquo;<samp>()</samp>&rsquo; after a function name just to indicate
it is a function.  <code>foo ()</code> is not a function, it is a function
call with no arguments.
