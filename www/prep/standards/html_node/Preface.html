<h2 class="chapter">1 About the GNU Coding Standards</h2>

<p>The GNU Coding Standards were written by Richard Stallman and other GNU
Project volunteers.  Their purpose is to make the GNU system clean,
consistent, and easy to install.  This document can also be read as a
guide to writing portable, robust and reliable programs.  It focuses on
programs written in C, but many of the rules and principles are useful
even if you write in another programming language.  The rules often
state reasons for writing in a certain way.

   <p><a name="index-where-to-obtain-_0040code_007bstandards_002etexi_007d-1"></a><a name="index-downloading-this-manual-2"></a>If you did not obtain this file directly from the GNU project and
recently, please check for a newer version.  You can get the GNU
Coding Standards from the GNU web server in many
different formats, including the Texinfo source, PDF, HTML, DVI, plain
text, and more, at: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/">http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/</a>.

   <p>If you are maintaining an official GNU package, in addition to this
document, please read and follow the GNU maintainer information
(see <a href="../maintain/index.html#Top">Contents</a>).

join the mailing list <code>gnustandards-commit@gnu.org</code>, via the web
interface at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnustandards-commit">http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnustandards-commit</a>. 
Archives are also available there.

<a href="mailto:bug-standards@gnu.org">bug-standards@gnu.org</a>.  If you make a suggestion, please
include a suggested new wording for it, to help us consider the
suggestion efficiently.  We prefer a context diff to the Texinfo
source, but if that's difficult for you, you can make a context diff
for some other version of this document, or propose it in any way that
makes it clear.  The source repository for this document can be found

   <p>These standards cover the minimum of what is important when writing a
GNU package.  Likely, the need for additional standards will come up. 
Sometimes, you might suggest that such standards be added to this
document.  If you think your standards would be generally useful, please
do suggest them.

   <p>You should also set standards for your package on many questions not
addressed or not firmly specified here.  The most important point is to
be self-consistent&mdash;try to stick to the conventions you pick, and try
to document them as much as possible.  That way, your program will be
more maintainable by others.

   <p>The GNU Hello program serves as an example of how to follow the GNU
coding standards for a trivial program.
