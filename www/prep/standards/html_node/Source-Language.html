<h3 class="section">3.1 Which Languages to Use</h3>

<p><a name="index-programming-languages-14"></a>
When you want to use a language that gets compiled and runs at high
speed, the best language to use is C.  Using another language is like
using a non-standard feature: it will cause trouble for users.  Even if
GCC supports the other language, users may find it inconvenient to have
to install the compiler for that other language in order to build your
program.  For example, if you write your program in C++, people will
have to install the GNU C++ compiler in order to compile your program.

   <p>C has one other advantage over C++ and other compiled languages: more
people know C, so more people will find it easy to read and modify the
program if it is written in C.

   <p>So in general it is much better to use C, rather than the
comparable alternatives.

   <p>But there are two exceptions to that conclusion:

     <ul>
<li>It is no problem to use another language to write a tool specifically
intended for use with that language.  That is because the only people
who want to build the tool will be those who have installed the other
language anyway.

     <li>If an application is of interest only to a narrow part of the community,
then the question of which language it is written in has less effect on
other people, so you may as well please yourself. 
</ul>

   <p>Many programs are designed to be extensible: they include an interpreter
for a language that is higher level than C.  Often much of the program
is written in that language, too.  The Emacs editor pioneered this
technique.

   <p><a name="index-Guile-15"></a><a name="index-GNOME-and-Guile-16"></a>The standard extensibility interpreter for GNU software is Guile
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/</a>), which implements the
language Scheme (an especially clean and simple dialect of Lisp). 
Guile also includes bindings for GTK+/GNOME, making it practical to
write modern GUI functionality within Guile.  We don't reject programs
written in other &ldquo;scripting languages&rdquo; such as Perl and Python, but
using Guile is very important for the overall consistency of the GNU
system.
