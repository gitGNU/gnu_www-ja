<!-- This file used to contain an HTML translation of (the unmaintained)
     /gd/gnuorg/MAILINGLISTS, which is also available in the emacs/etc
     directory.  Apparently www.gnu.org now redirects to lists.gnu.org
     on its own (so the above is ignored), so there seems no purpose in
     updating it.  --karl, 27sep04.  -->
