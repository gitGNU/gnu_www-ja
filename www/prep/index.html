<p>This directory collects some GNU organizational documents.  For
general information about the GNU project and the Free Software
Foundation, see <a href="/">www.gnu.org</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>

<dt><b><a href="ftp.html">The GNU FTP mirror list</a></b></dt>
<dd>lists sites which mirror ftp.gnu.org, which holds most official GNU
software releases.  Please use a mirror if you can.  If you'd like to
volunteer your site as another mirror, please see this separate page
with <a href="/server/mirror.html">Advice for Running Mirrors</a>.</dd>
<br>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.fsf.org/resources/service/">The GNU service
       directory</a></b></dt>
<dd>is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs and GCC, for a
fee or in some cases at no charge.</dd>
<br>
<dt><b><a href="standards/">The GNU coding standards</a></b></dt>
<dd>attempt to make the GNU system clean, consistent, and easy to
install.  This document can also be read as a guide to writing portable,
robust and reliable programs.  It focuses on programs written in C, but
many of the rules and principles are useful even if you write in another
programming language.</dd>
<br>
<dt><b><a href="maintain/">The GNU maintainer information</a></b></dt>
<dd>includes guidelines and advice for someone who is the
maintainer of a GNU program on behalf of the GNU Project.  Everyone is
entitled to change and redistribute GNU software; you need not pay
attention to this file to get permission.  But if you want to maintain a
version for widespread distribution, we suggest you follow these
guidelines; if you would like to be a GNU maintainer, then it is
essential to follow these guidelines.</dd>
<br>
<dt><a href="tasks.html">GNU task list information</a></dt>
<dd>is available here, although the actual <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tasklist">task list items</a> are
now maintained at <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">savannah</a>.</dd>
<br>
<dt><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/">GNU mailing list information</a></dt>
<dd>is now at <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/">lists.gnu.org</a>.  There
are hundreds of other aliases and forwarding addresses which are not
full-fledged lists, so don't consider the list there to be complete.
<small>(The mailinglists.html file that used to be here in /prep
is now obsolete.)</small></dd>
<br>
<dt><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/">GNU Program Index information</a></dt>
<dd>is now subsumed in the <a
href="http://directory.fsf.org/">FSF/Unesco Free Software Directory</a>.
<small>(The program.index.html file that used to be here in /prep
is now obsolete.)</small></dd>
</dl>

<p>By the way, the <tt>prep</tt> directory name here refers to
<tt>prep.ai.mit.edu</tt>, one of the first hosts used by GNU for
distributing GNU software, and project information like the above, over
the Internet.
</p>

<p>prep was in the MIT artificial intelligence lab at the time; today,
the hostname is an alias for ftp.gnu.org.  It still works for ftp, mail,
and even web access (although the web had not been invented at the time
prep was originally used).  Even today, references to prep survive in
documentation, mail archives, essays -- and the name of this directory.
