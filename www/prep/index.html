<p>This directory collects some GNU organizational documents. For general
information about the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation, see <a

<dl>
  <dt><strong><a href="/prep/ftp.html">The GNU FTP mirror list</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>lists sites which mirror ftp.gnu.org, which holds most official GNU
      software releases.  Please use a mirror if you can.  If you'd like to
      volunteer your site as another mirror, please see this separate page with
      <a href="/server/mirror.html">Advice for Running Mirrors</a>.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://www.fsf.org/resources/service/">The GNU service
  directory</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering support
      services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs and GCC, for a fee or in
      some cases at no charge.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="/prep/standards/">The GNU coding
  standards</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>attempt to make the GNU system clean, consistent, and easy to install. 
      This document can also be read as a guide to writing portable, robust and
      reliable programs.  It focuses on programs written in C, but many of the
      rules and principles are useful even if you write in another programming
      language.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="/prep/maintain/">GNU maintainer
  information</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>includes guidelines and advice for someone who is the maintainer of a
      GNU program on behalf of the GNU Project.  Everyone is entitled to change
      and redistribute GNU software; you need not pay attention to this file to
      get permission.  But if you want to maintain a version for widespread
      distribution, we suggest you follow these guidelines; if you would like
      to be (or are already) a GNU maintainer, then it is essential to follow
      these guidelines.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="/prep/tasks.html">GNU task list
  information</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>is available here, although the actual <a
      href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tasklist">task list items</a> are
      now maintained at <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">savannah</a>.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/">GNU mailing list
  information</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>is now at <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/">lists.gnu.org</a>.  There are
      hundreds of other aliases and forwarding addresses which are not
      full-fledged lists, so don't consider the list there to be complete.
      <small>(The mailinglists.html file that used to be here in /prep is now
      obsolete.)</small></dd>
  <dt><strong><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/">GNU Program Index
  information</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>is now subsumed in the <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/">Free
      Software Directory</a>.  <small>(The program.index.html file that used to
      be here in /prep is now obsolete.)</small></dd>
</dl>

<p>By the way, the <tt>prep</tt> directory name here refers to
<tt>prep.ai.mit.edu</tt>, one of the first hosts used by GNU for distributing
GNU software, and project information like the above, over the Internet.</p>

<p>prep was in the MIT artificial intelligence lab at the time; today, the
hostname is an alias for ftp.gnu.org. It still works for ftp, mail, and even
web access (although the web had not been invented at the time prep was
originally used). Even today, references to prep survive in documentation, mail
archives, essays&mdash;and the name of this directory.</p>
