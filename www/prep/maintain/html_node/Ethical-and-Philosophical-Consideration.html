<h2 class="chapter">13 Ethical and Philosophical Consideration</h2>
<a name="index-ethics"></a>
<a name="index-philosophy"></a>

<p>The GNU project takes a strong stand for software freedom.  Many
times, this means you&rsquo;ll need to avoid certain technologies when their
use would conflict with our long-term goals.
</p>
<p>Software patents threaten the advancement of free software and freedom
to program.  There are so many software patents in the US that any
large program probably implements hundreds of patented techniques,
unknown to the program&rsquo;s developers.  It would be futile and
self-defeating to try to find and avoid all these patents.  But there
are some patents which we know are likely to be used to threaten free
software, so we make an effort to avoid the patented techniques.  If
you are concerned about the danger of a patent and would like advice,
write to <a href="mailto:licensing@gnu.org">licensing@gnu.org</a>, and we will try to help you get
advice from a lawyer.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the GNU project takes a strong stand against a particular
patented technology in order to encourage society to reject it.
</p>
<p>For example, the MP3 audio format is covered by a software patent in
the USA and some other countries.  A patent holder has threatened
lawsuits against the developers of free programs (these are not GNU
programs) to produce and play MP3, and some GNU/Linux distributors are
afraid to include them.  Development of the programs continues, but we
campaign for the rejection of MP3 format in favor of Ogg Vorbis format.
</p>
<p>A GNU package should not recommend use of any non-free program, nor
should it require a non-free program (such as a non-free compiler or
IDE) to build.  Thus, a GNU package cannot be written in a programming
language that does not have a free software implementation.  Now that
GNU/Linux systems are widely available, all GNU packages should
provide full functionality on a 100% free GNU/Linux system, and should
not require any non-free software to build or function.
The GNU Coding Standards say a lot more about this issue.
</p>
<p>Similarly, a GNU package should not require the use of non-free
software, including JavaScript, for the coordination of its
development.  For example, please don&rsquo;t use Transifex for translation
of your software because it requires your translators to use non-free,
JavaScript-based editing tools.  Instead, a service without any
ethical concerns should be used, such as GNU&rsquo;s Pootle instance
(<a href="https://chapters.gnu.org/pootle">https://chapters.gnu.org/pootle</a>) or The Translation Project
(<a href="http://translationproject.org">http://translationproject.org</a>).
</p>
<p>A GNU package should not refer the user to any non-free documentation
for free software.  The need for free documentation to come with free
software is now a major focus of the GNU project; to show that we are
serious about the need for free documentation, we must not contradict
our position by recommending use of documentation that isn&rsquo;t free.
</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t host discussions about your package in a service that
requires nonfree software.  For instance, Google+ &ldquo;communities&rdquo;
require running a nonfree JavaScript program to post a message, so
they can&rsquo;t be used in the Free World.  Google Groups has the same
problem.  To host discussions there would be excluding people who live
by free software principles.
</p>
<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t order people not to use such services to talk
with each other.  What you can do is not legitimize them, and use your
influence to lead people away from them.  For instance, where you say
where to have discussions related to the program, don&rsquo;t list such a
place.
</p>
<p>Finally, new issues concerning the ethics of software freedom come up
frequently.  We ask that GNU maintainers, at least on matters that
pertain specifically to their package, stand with the rest of the GNU
project when such issues come up.
