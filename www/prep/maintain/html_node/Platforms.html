<h2 class="chapter">8 Platforms to Support</h2>

<p>Most GNU packages run on a wide range of platforms.  These platforms are
not equally important.
</p>
<p>The most important platforms for a GNU package to support are GNU and
GNU/Linux.  Developing the GNU operating system is the whole point of
the GNU Project; a GNU package exists to make the whole GNU system more
powerful.  So please keep that goal in mind and let it shape your work.
For instance, every new feature you add should work on GNU, and
GNU/Linux if possible too.  If a new feature only runs on GNU and
GNU/Linux, it could still be acceptable.  However, a feature that runs
only on other systems and not on GNU or GNU/Linux makes no sense in a
GNU package.
</p>
<p>You will naturally want to keep the program running on all the platforms
it supports.  But you personally will not have access to most of these
platforms&mdash;so how should you do it?
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about trying to get access to all of these platforms.  Even
if you did have access to all the platforms, it would be inefficient for
you to test the program on each platform yourself.  Instead, you should
test the program on a few platforms, including GNU or GNU/Linux, and let
the users test it on the other platforms.  You can do this through a
pretest phase before the real release; when there is no reason to expect
problems, in a package that is mostly portable, you can just make a
release and let the users tell you if anything unportable was
introduced.
</p>
<p>It is important to test the program personally on GNU or GNU/Linux,
because these are the most important platforms for a GNU package.  If
you don&rsquo;t have access to one of these platforms, as a GNU maintainer
you can get access to the general GNU login machine; see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html</a>.
</p>
<p>Supporting other platforms is optional&mdash;we do it when that seems like
a good idea, but we don&rsquo;t consider it obligatory.  If the users don&rsquo;t
take care of a certain platform, you may have to desupport it unless
and until users come forward to help.  Conversely, if a user offers
changes to support an additional platform, you will probably want to
install them, but you don&rsquo;t have to.  If you feel the changes are
complex and ugly, if you think that they will increase the burden of
future maintenance, you can and should reject them.  This includes
both free or mainly-free platforms such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and
NetBSD, and non-free platforms such as Windows.
