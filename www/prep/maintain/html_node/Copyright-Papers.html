<h3 class="section">6.1 Copyright Papers</h3>
<a name="index-copyright-papers"></a>
<a name="index-assignments_002c-copyright"></a>
<a name="index-disclaimers"></a>

<p>If you maintain an FSF-copyrighted package
certain legal procedures are required when incorporating legally significant
changes written by other people.  This ensures that the FSF has the
legal right to distribute the package, and the standing to defend its
GPL-covered status in court if necessary.
</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong> incorporating significant changes, make sure that the
person who wrote the changes has signed copyright papers and that the
Free Software Foundation has received and signed them.  We may also
need an employer&rsquo;s disclaimer from the person&rsquo;s employer, which
confirms that the work was not part of the person&rsquo;s job and the
employer makes no claim on it.  However, a copy of the person&rsquo;s
employment contract, showing that the employer can&rsquo;t claim any rights
to this work, is often sufficient.
</p>
<p>If the employer does claim the work was part of the person&rsquo;s job, and
there is no clear basis to say that claim is invalid, then we have to
consider it valid.  Then the person cannot assign copyright, but the
employer can.  Many companies have done this.  Please ask the
appropriate managers to contact <code>assign@gnu.org</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-data-base-of-GNU-copyright-assignments"></a>
<p>To check whether papers have been received, look in
<samp>/gd/gnuorg/copyright.list</samp>.  If you can&rsquo;t look there directly,
<a href="mailto:fsf-records@gnu.org">fsf-records@gnu.org</a> can check for you.  Our clerk can also
check for papers that are waiting to be entered and inform you when
expected papers arrive.
</p>
<a name="index-_002fgd_002fgnuorg-directory"></a>
<p>The directory <samp>/gd/gnuorg</samp> mentioned throughout this document is
available on the general GNU server, currently
<code>fencepost.gnu.org</code>.  If you are the maintainer of a GNU package,
you should have an account there.  If you don&rsquo;t have one already, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html</a>.  You can also
ask for accounts for people who significantly help you in working on
the package.  Such GNU login accounts include email
(see <a href="http://www.fsf.org/about/systems/sending-mail-via-fencepost">http://www.fsf.org/about/systems/sending-mail-via-fencepost</a>).
</p>
<p>In order for the contributor to know person should sign papers, you need
to ask per for the necessary papers.  If you don&rsquo;t know per well, and you
don&rsquo;t know that person is used to our ways of handling copyright papers,
then it might be a good idea to raise the subject with a message like
this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you be willing to assign the copyright to the Free Software
Foundation, so that we could install it in <var>package</var>?
</p></blockquote>

<p>or
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you be willing to sign a copyright disclaimer to put this change
in the public domain, so that we can install it in <var>package</var>?
</p></blockquote>

<p>If the contributor then wants more information, you can send per the file
<samp>/gd/gnuorg/conditions.text</samp>, which explains per options (assign
vs. disclaim) and their consequences.
</p>
<p>Once the conversation is under way and the contributor is ready for
more details, you should send one of the templates that are found in
the directory <samp>/gd/gnuorg/Copyright/</samp>; they are also available
from the <samp>doc/Copyright/</samp> directory of the <code>gnulib</code> project
at <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib</a>.  This section
explains which templates you should use in which circumstances.
<strong>Please don&rsquo;t use any of the templates except for those listed
here, and please don&rsquo;t change the wording.</strong>
</p>
<p>Once the conversation is under way, you can send the contributor the
precise wording and instructions by email.  Before you do this, make
sure to get the current version of the template you will use!  We change
these templates occasionally&mdash;don&rsquo;t keep using an old version.
</p>
<p>For large changes, ask the contributor for an assignment.  Send per a
copy of the file <samp>request-assign.changes</samp>.  (Like all the
&lsquo;<samp>request-</samp>&rsquo; files, it is in <samp>/gd/gnuorg/Copyright</samp> and in
<code>gnulib</code>.)
</p>
<p>For medium to small changes, request a personal disclaimer by sending
per the file <samp>request-disclaim.changes</samp>.
</p>
<p>If the contributor is likely to keep making changes, person might want
to sign an assignment for all per future changes to the program.  So it
is useful to offer per that alternative.  If person wants to do it that
way, send per the <samp>request-assign.future</samp>.
</p>
<p>When you send a <samp>request-</samp> file, you don&rsquo;t need to fill in anything
before sending it.  Just send the file verbatim to the contributor.  The
file gives per instructions for how to ask the FSF to mail per the
papers to sign.  The <samp>request-</samp> file also raises the issue of
getting an employer&rsquo;s disclaimer from the contributor&rsquo;s employer.
</p>
<p>When the contributor emails the form to the FSF, the FSF sends per an
electronic (usually PDF) copy of the assignment.  This, or whatever
response is required, should happen within five business days of the
initial request.  If no reply from the FSF comes after that time,
please send a reminder.  If there is still no response after an
additional week, please write to <a href="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">maintainers@gnu.org</a> about it.
</p>
<p>After receiving the necessary form, the contributor needs to sign it.
Contributors residing in the USA may use GPG in order to sign their
assignment.  Contributors located in the USA or Germany can print,
sign, and then email (or fax) a scanned copy back to the FSF.
(Specific instructions for both cases are sent with the assignment
form.)  They may use postal mail, if they prefer. Contributors
residing outside the USA or Germany must mail the signed form to the
FSF via postal mail.  To emphasize, the necessary distinction is
between residents and non-residents of these countries; citizenship
does not matter.
</p>
<p>For less common cases, we have template files you should send to the
contributor.  Be sure to fill in the name of the person and the name
of the program in these templates, where it says &lsquo;<samp>NAME OF PERSON</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp>NAME OF PROGRAM</samp>&rsquo;, before sending; otherwise person might
sign without noticing them, and the papers would be useless.  Note
that in some templates there is more than one place to put the name of
the program or the name of the person; be sure to change all of them.
All the templates raise the issue of an employer&rsquo;s disclaimer as well.
</p>
<a name="index-legal-papers-for-changes-in-manuals"></a>
<p>You do not need to ask for separate papers for a manual that is
distributed only in the software package it describes.  But if we
sometimes distribute the manual separately (for instance, if we publish
it as a book), then we need separate legal papers for changes in the
manual.  For smaller changes, use
<samp>disclaim.changes.manual</samp>; for larger ones, use
<samp>assign.changes.manual</samp>.  To cover both past and future
changes to a manual, you can use <samp>assign.future.manual</samp>.
For a translation of a manual, use <samp>assign.translation.manual</samp>.
</p>
<p>For translations of program strings (as used by GNU Gettext, for
example; see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Internationalization.html#Internationalization">Internationalization</a> in <cite>GNU Coding
Standards</cite>), use <samp>disclaim.translation</samp>.  If you make use of the
Translation Project (<a href="http://translationproject.org">http://translationproject.org</a>) facilities,
please check with the TP coordinators that they have sent the
contributor the papers; if they haven&rsquo;t, then you should send the
papers.  In any case, you should wait for the confirmation from the
FSF that the signed papers have been received and accepted before
integrating the new contributor&rsquo;s material, as usual.
</p>
<p>If a contributor is reluctant to sign an assignment for a large change,
and is willing to sign a disclaimer instead, that is acceptable, so you
should offer this alternative if it helps you reach agreement.  We
prefer an assignment for a larger change, so that we can enforce the GNU
GPL for the new text, but a disclaimer is enough to let us use the text.
</p>
<p>If you maintain a collection of programs, occasionally someone will
contribute an entire separate program or manual that should be added to
the collection.  Then you can use the files
<samp>request-assign.program</samp>, <samp>disclaim.program</samp>,
<samp>assign.manual</samp>, and <samp>disclaim.manual</samp>.  We very much prefer
an assignment for a new separate program or manual, unless it is quite
small, but a disclaimer is acceptable if the contributor insists on
handling the matter that way.
</p>
<p>If a contributor wants the FSF to publish only a pseudonym, that is
ok.  The contributor should say this, and state the desired pseudonym,
when answering the <samp>request-</samp> form.  The actual legal papers will
use the real name, but the FSF will publish only the pseudonym.  When
using one of the other forms, fill in the real name but ask the
contributor to discuss the use of a pseudonym with
<a href="mailto:assign@gnu.org">assign@gnu.org</a> before sending back the signed form.
</p>
<p><strong>Although there are other templates besides the ones listed here,
they are for special circumstances; please do not use them without
getting advice from <a href="mailto:assign@gnu.org">assign@gnu.org</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are not sure what to do, then please ask <a href="mailto:assign@gnu.org">assign@gnu.org</a> for
advice; if the contributor asks you questions about the meaning and
consequences of the legal papers, and you don&rsquo;t know the answers, you
can forward them to <a href="mailto:assign@gnu.org">assign@gnu.org</a> and we will answer.
</p>
<p><strong>Please do not try changing the wording of a template yourself.
If you think a change is needed, please talk with <a href="mailto:assign@gnu.org">assign@gnu.org</a>,
and we will work with a lawyer to decide what to do.</strong>
