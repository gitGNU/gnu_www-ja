1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,999
Computers

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,999
I've loved them since I've been able to 
afford to have my own

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,999
back in the beginning of the modern computer era,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,999
the 1980s.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,999
And I've owned a large number of different kinds of computer

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,999
and I've expressed, publicly, loyalty to this kind or that kind. 

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,999
But recently my mind has turned, as many people's have,
to this whole business of Free Software.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,999
There is a lot of confusion about what this means

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,999
and I'd like to help clear it up

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,999
because this happens to be a year of celebration,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,999
and I want to help us all celebrate it

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,999
and to look forward to the future of Free Software.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,999
If you have

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,999
plumbing in your house

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,999
it may be that you don't understand it,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,999
but you may have a friend that does 

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,999
and they may suggest you move a pipe here, a stopcock there,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,999
or a valve somewhere else.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,999
And you're not breaking the law by doing that, are you?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,999
Because it's your house and you own the plumbing.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,999
You can't do that with your computer.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,999
You can't actually fiddle with your operating system,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,999
and you certainly can't share any ideas you have about
your operating system with other people

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,999
because Apple and Microsoft, who run the two most popular operating systems

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,999
are very firm about that fact that they own that

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,999
and no one else can have anything to do with it.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,999
Now this may seem natural to you:

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,999
"Why shouldn't they?"

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,999
But actually, Why can't you do what you like? 

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,999
And why can't the community alter, improve, and share?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,999
That's how science works, after all...

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,999
All knowledge is free,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,999
and all knowledge is shared in good science.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,999
If it isn't -- it's bad science 

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,999
and it's a kind of tyranny.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,999
And this is, really, where it all started

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,999
A man called Richard Stallman

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,999
decided 25 years ago, almost to this very day, to

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,999
write a whole new operating system from the ground up.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,999
He called this system GNU which stands for "GNU is Not Unix"

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,999
because it isn't Unix,

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,999
it is similar to Unix in many ways, 

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,999
but every element of it, every module, every little section of the code

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,999
(and it's a gigantic code because it's to run on many platforms)

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,999
is run by the community, run by coders "out there"

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,999
who are welcomed in to the GNU community, to help improve the software.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,999
Every "distro", as they are called, every distribution of GNU  

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,999
is tested, worked upon, and refined 

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,999
by people whose only interest is creating the perfect operating system

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,999
that can be used across the spectrum of platforms and by as many users as possible.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,999
Now, there came a time when the kernel, which
is the central part of an operating system,
needed to be written.  

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,999
And a man called Linus Torvalds, of whom you may have heard,

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,999
wrote the kernel and it was named after his name,

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,999
Linux (line-ucks) 

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,999
or Linux (Lin-ucks) as some people pronounce it.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,999
And Linux is the kernel that runs within GNU

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,999
and I'm here 

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,999
simply to remind you that GNU and Linux are the twin pillars 
of the Free Software community,

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,999
people who believe, and this is the important part, 

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,999
that software should be Free, 

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,999
that the community of users should be allowed to adapt it,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,999
adopt it, change it, to improve it, and to spread those improvements around,

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,999
like science.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,999
That's basically what it is saying.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,999
In the same way that good scientists share everything
and all knowledge is open and free 

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,999
so it should be with an operating system.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,999
So, if you're a supporter of GNU, 

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,999
if you're a support of Linux, and the Free Software Foundation,

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,999
you are probably wondering "Well what can I do?"

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,999
The most obvious thing you can do is use a GNU/Linux operating system
on your own computer.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,999
It's much easier than you might think.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,999
Go to the website "gnu.org" and see if you can find an operating system
that suits you.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,999
Probably, if you like a good graphical user-interface,

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,999
something like g-New-Sense, gNewSense 

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,999
You'll see it there on gnu.org.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,999
Or, if you're a really smart cookie, 

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,999
you might want to do your own coding.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,999
You might want to contribute to the sum of knowledge

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,999
that makes GNU and Linux what they are.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,999
Either way, 

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,999
I hope you will join me

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,999
in wishing GNU a very happy twenty-fifth birthday.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,999
Lets do that now, actually...

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,999
Happy birthday, GNU!

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,999
Twenty-five years old.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,999
The operating system of the future.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,999
Freedom!

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,999
Chocolaty good.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,999
The tastiest operating system in the world...

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,999
and it's all free.
