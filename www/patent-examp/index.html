<h2>Software patents that have harmed free software</h2>

<p>[Please repost this widely, anywhere it's appropriate.]</p>

<p>We would like to collect information about cases where free software
has been harmed by software patents-that is, cases where a free program
has been withdrawn from use or interfered with, or where a feature was
taken out or never written in the first place, because of the danger of
a patent.</p>

<p>We hope to use this information to argue against the system of
software patents wherever possible.</p>

<p>If you know of such a case, please write to 
<a href="mailto:patent-examples@gnu.org">&lt;patent-examples@gnu.org&gt;</a>
and tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Ideally we would like to know the name of the program, its
developer's name and email address or other contact information, what
happened to the program, and the patent number.  If you know those
things, please include them in your report.  But if you don't have all
of that information, please write anyway and tell us whatever you know.
For instance, if you can tell us how to contact the program's developer,
we can probably get the rest of the information from the developer.  If
you can tell us just the program's name, we may be able to find the
developer.  We may write back to you to try to get more details; any
leads for getting more details are also welcome.</p>

<p>The <a href="patent-examples.html">information collected so far</a>
is available.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
