1
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:23,447
These are the stamps available in Tux Paint.
We can use them in our paintings.

2
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:29,161
We can increase or decrease their size
by clicking here.

3
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:37,578
See, I have now shrunk it,
and now it is enlarged.

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,573
Tux Paint has only a few stamps 
that show the native flora of Kerala, 

5
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:48,094
In a project by the Free Software Users Group
of students from the VHSS Irimpanam school,

6
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:54,150
we decided to add more stamps
of Kerala flowers, vegetables and fruits.

7
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:57,628
As part of the project,

8
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:08,336
students brought digital photographs of 
flowers, fruits and vegetables available

9
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:15,375
in their locality, taken with 
digital and mobile phone cameras.

10
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:23,856
Then, using the Free image editing 
program 'GIMP'

11
00:01:23,906 --> 00:01:27,373
these images were cropped, 
backgrounds removed,

12
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:36,385
resolution was reduced to 150x150,
and saved as .png files.

13
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:41,614
We took photographs from our premises
and brought them to school.

14
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:53,233
Then, we cut them into small stamps using 
GIMP and saved them in our computers.

15
00:01:54,565 --> 00:02:03,066
Students processed their digital photos with 
GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

16
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,210
The resulting images were added to 
Tux Paint.

17
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:15,532
Freedom 0, the freedom
to run the program for any purpose,

18
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:20,070
allowed the school to install the program
in as many computers as needed.

19
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:31,511
Freedom 1 grants the freedom to study how the
program works, and to change it as needed.

20
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:39,592
Students made use of freedom 1 to adapt
Tux Paint to the needs of their community.

21
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:43,529
All computers in this school, including the
administration offices,

22
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:49,092
run exclusively
the Free Libre operating system GNU/Linux.

23
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:53,709
Nearly 1,000 students from 10 to 15 
years old

24
00:02:53,807 --> 00:03:03,430
use the GNU/Linux system regularly
in the lab and in the classroom.

25
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:11,146
Then we recorded the names of these 
flowers in Malayalam using a microphone.

26
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:16,012
Appooppan Thaady.

27
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:22,660
Then we typed the names of the flowers in
Malayalam, and saved them as text files.

28
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,202
Freedom 2 allowed the school to hand out 
copies of GIMP and Tux Paint,

29
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:40,022
so students were able to install the 
programs at home for further practice.

30
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,704
These modifications have been uploaded to 
our website

31
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:07,579
and made available to others with 
instructions for installation.

32
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:10,271
Anyone interested can download 
and install them.

33
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,079
Different varieties of local flowers
are used in it.

34
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:18,448
Our website is: http://vhssirimpanam.org

35
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:25,201
Freedom 3: Students distributed their 
modified version through the school's website.

36
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:31,951
The results...
