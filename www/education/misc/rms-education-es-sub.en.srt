1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm Richard Stallman

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,300
25 years ago I founded the Free Software movement. [In 1983]

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,700
Free Software is

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,600
software that respects the user's freedom

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,000
and the social solidarity of his community.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,200
Non free programs 

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,500
are proprietary software

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,300
that is,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,000
they take away the users' freedom

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,400
keeping them 

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
divided and helpless.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,900
Divided because they are forbidden 

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
from sharing the program

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,300
and helpless because the users

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,300
don't have the source code of the program.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,000
That is,

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,000
they cannot change it,

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,500
they cannot find out

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,000
what the program is really doing,

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,500
and it can do very bad things.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Free Software means 

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,500
that the user has 

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,200
the 4 essential freedoms:

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,223
Freedom 0 is the freedom

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,400
to run the program for any purpose.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,300
Freedom 1 is the freedom

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,100
to study the source code of the program

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,000
and change it to make it do what you wish.

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Freedom 2 is the freedom

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,800
to help your neighbor

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,800
that is,

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,000
the freedom to make and distribute

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,500
exact copies of the program whenever you want.

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,100
And freedom 3 is the freedom

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,500
to contribute to your community

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
that is,

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,700
the freedom to make and distribute copies

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,500
of your modified versions of the program.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
With these four freedoms

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,800
a program is Free Software because

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,400
the social system for its use and distribution 

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,900
is an ethical system

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,200
that respects everyone's  freedom

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,300
and the freedom of the community of users.

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,200
Software must be Free because

46
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,800
we all deserve freedom

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,700
we all deserve to be allowed to participate in a free community.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Therefore,

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,400
schools should teach only

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,950
Free Software.

51
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,700
There are four reasons why this is so,

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,900
The most shallow reason is to save money.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Schools don't have enough money,

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,100
so they shouldn't waste their money

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,000
paying for permission to use proprietary software.

56
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,500
This is an obvious reason,

57
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,900
But some proprietary software companies

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,500
usually eliminate this reason

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,000
 by donating copies of their proprietary programs 

60
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,000
to the schools 

61
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,600
at no charge or at a small price.

62
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,000
The reason why they do that is to get students addicted.

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,700
It's a malicious plan.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,100
It's a plan to use schools 

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,500
as instruments to impose

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,000
a permanent dependence on students.

67
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,400
If a school teaches how to use a proprietary program,

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,900
the student will be dependent on that program

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,100
and after he graduates

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,600
he will have to pay to use that program.

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,400
He will probably work for a company

72
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,900
that does not receive copies of the program free of charge.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Therefore, proprietary software developers use schools

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,400
to impose permanent dependence on the whole society.

75
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Schools must refuse to participate 

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
in such a malicious plan

77
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,000
because schools have a social mission

78
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,700
which is to educate the next generation

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
to be good citizens of a 

80
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,900
capable, strong, independent, cooperating and free society.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,200
This can only be achieved by teaching Free Software.

82
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
Schools must eliminate,

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,300
delete proprietary software

84
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
and install Free Software.

85
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,200
But there is  a deeper reason:

86
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,400
to form good programmers,

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,000
because in order to learn good programming skills

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,800
students need to read lots of code and write lots of code.

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
To learn to write good code

90
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,300
for big programs

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,900
students need to write small changes

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,300
in the code of big programs.

93
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,500
All this is possible only with Free Software.

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,500
Only Free Software

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
allows education in information technology.

96
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,900
But there is still a deeper reason:

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,600
to teach good citizenship,

98
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,800
because schools have the mission to teach

99
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,600
not only facts and technical skills,

100
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,900
but above all the spirit of good will,

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,400
the habit of helping others.

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Therefore, each class should have this rule:

103
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,800
students, if you bring a program to the class,

104
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,600
you can't keep it for yourself,

105
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,800
you must share it with the rest of the class.

106
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,900
The school should practice what it preaches,

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,400
it should introduce only Free Software

108
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,800
in the classroom.

109
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,900
All schools should migrate to Free Software

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,900
and teach exclusively Free Software

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,600
because each school should participate

112
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,000
in leading society towards

113
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,900
freedom and social solidarity.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,300
Thank you.
