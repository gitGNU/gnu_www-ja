1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm Richard Stallman.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,000
25 years ago [in 1983]

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,400
I founded the 
Free Software movement.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,700
Free Software

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,600
is software that respects
users' freedom

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,000
and the social solidarity
of their community.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,500
Nonfree programs 
are proprietary software.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,300
That is,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,000
they take away users' freedom

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,000
keeping them
divided and helpless.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,900
Divided

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because they are forbidden 
from sharing the program

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,000
and helpless

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,500
because users don't have the
source code of the program.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,000
That is,

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,500
they cannot change it, 
they cannot even find out

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,000
what the program 
is really doing,

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,500
and it can do very bad things.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Free Software

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,200
means that the user has
4 essential freedoms:

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,800
Freedom 0

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,400
is the freedom to run the 
program for any purpose.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Freedom 1

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,800
is the freedom to study 
the source code of the program

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,000
and change it 
to make it do what you wish.

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,500
Freedom 2

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,800
is the freedom 
to help your neighbor;

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,800
that is,

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,300
the freedom 
to make and distribute

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,500
exact copies of the program 
whenever you want.

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
And freedom 3

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,500
is the freedom to 
contribute to your community;

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
that is,

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,700
the freedom to make 
and distribute copies

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,500
of your modified versions 
of the program.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,600
With these four freedoms
a program is Free Software

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,400
because the social system for 
its use and distribution

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,900
is an ethical system that 
respects everyone's  freedom

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,300
and the freedom 
of the community of users.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Software must be Free because
we all deserve freedom,

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
we all deserve

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,900
to be allowed to  participate 
in a free community.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Therefore,

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,000
schools should teach 
only Free Software.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,700
There are four reasons 
why this is so.

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,900
The most shallow reason 
is to save money.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Schools don't have 
enough money,

48
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,100
so they shouldn't 
waste their money

49
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,400
paying for permission to use 
proprietary software.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,700
This is an obvious reason,

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,900
but some proprietary software 
companies

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,500
usually eliminate this 
shallow reason

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,600
by donating copies 
of their proprietary programs

54
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,000
to the schools at no charge 
or at a small price.

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,000
The reason why they do that 
is to get students addicted.

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,700
It's a malicious plan.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,500
It's a plan to use schools
as instruments to impose

58
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,000
a permanent dependence 
on students.

59
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,400
If a school teaches how to use 
a proprietary program,

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,900
the student will be dependent 
on that program,

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,100
and after he graduates

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,600
he will have to pay 
to use that program.

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,400
He will probably 
work for a company

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,900
that does not receive copies 
of the program free of charge.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Therefore,

66
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,500
proprietary software 
developers use schools

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,400
to impose permanent dependence 
on the whole society.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,700
Schools must refuse

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,000
to participate 
in such a malicious plan

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,000
because schools have a 
social mission,

71
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,300
which is to educate the next 
generation to be good citizens

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,500
of a capable, strong, 
independent, cooperating and

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
free society.

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,200
This can only be achieved 
by teaching Free Software.

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Schools must eliminate,
delete proprietary software

76
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
and install Free Software.

77
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,200
But there is  a deeper reason:

78
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,400
to form good programmers,

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,000
because in order to learn
good programming skills

80
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,800
students need to read lots of 
code and write lots of code.

81
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,300
To learn to write good code 
for big programs

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,900
students need to write 
small changes

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,300
in the code of big programs.

84
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,500
All this is possible 
only with Free Software.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,500
Only Free Software

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
allows education 
in information technology.

87
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,900
But there is still 
a deeper reason:

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,600
to teach good citizenship,

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,800
because schools have the 
mission to teach

90
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,100
not only facts and technical 
skills, but above all

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,400
the spirit of good will, 
the habit of helping others.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Therefore, each class 
should have this rule:

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,800
"students, if you 
bring a program to the class,

94
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,600
you can't keep it for yourself,

95
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,800
you must share it 
with the rest of the class."

96
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,900
The school should practice 
what it preaches,

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,700
it should introduce only 
Free Software in the classroom.

98
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,900
All schools should migrate to 
Free Software

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,900
and teach exclusively 
Free Software

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,600
because each school should 
participate

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:08,200
in leading society towards
freedom and social solidarity.

102
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.
