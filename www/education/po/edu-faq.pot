"Many Free Software advocates encounter difficulties when talking to the "
"administrators of educational institutions about the advantages of using and "
"teaching Free Software. Often school administrators have never heard of Free "
"Software or have heard only about &ldquo;open source&rdquo;, so they raise "
"many doubts. Here we put together some of the most common questions and the "
"best possible answers to eliminate uncertainties."

"As a teacher, I've been trying hard to explain to the school's "
"administrators the advantages that open source software can bring to our "

"&ldquo;Open source&rdquo; refers only to the technical advantages of "
"software. Schools may not be interested in that aspect since most probably "
"technical requirements are already satisfied by the proprietary software in "
"use. You need to talk to them in terms of Free Libre Software, not "
"&ldquo;open source&rdquo;, so that you can explain to them the philosophical "
"and ethical reasons why educational institutions should reject proprietary "
"software."

"I would love to see all schools migrate to Free Software, but I think it's "

"While it is true that proprietary software corporations have managed to "

"is also true that many schools around the world have adopted Free Software "
"with excellent results.  See our <a href=\"/education/edu-cases.html\">Case "

"If you are literally forced to teach nonfree software, you should tell your "

"We must not forget that schools have a great influence on society, so making "
"our students aware of the advantages of Free Software is a way of putting "
"pressure on decision makers. You can start by telling your students about "
"Free Software and its ethical values, as they might never have heard of "
"it. With your endorsement and support, this may lead to the formation of a "
"<a href=\"http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group_list\">Free Software Group</a> "
"in your school. Then the group can make its voice heard by writing letters "
"to the Ministry, holding events to promote Free Software, and other similar "
"activities."

"When computer users will start demanding their rights, Governments will have "
"to issue their laws accordingly. That is why political and social awareness "
