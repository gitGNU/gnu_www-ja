"Our institution took special interest in promoting the main aspects of the "

"the meetings organized by the <a href=\"http://www.ilug-cochin.org/\"> "
"Indian Libre User Group (ILUG-Cochin)</a> in the nearby city of "

"The migration to Free Software in our school was the result of a project "

"2001, involved several thousand schools in Kerala and in 2006 it switched "

"Kerala that promotes the use of Free Software in the private and public "
"sectors. SPACE, as well as local Swathanthra Software users groups, played a "

"The use of Free programs in the classroom was facilitated by the "
"implementation of training modules aimed at instructing teachers on the use "
