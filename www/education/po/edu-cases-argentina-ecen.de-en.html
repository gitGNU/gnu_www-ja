<p>The following information was extracted from a report submitted to us
by ECEN Elementary Teacher Debora Badilla Huento. Her commitment played 
a key role in raising Free Software awareness and ultimately getting 
the school to migrate.</p>

<div class="edu-cases">
    
<h3>Location</h3>
   
<p>City of Neuqu&eacute;n, capital of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuquen_Province">
Province of Neuqu&eacute;n</a>, in the Argentine Patagonia Region.</p>
			
<h3>About</h3>
			
<p>We are a private Christian school providing education from 
pre-elementary to high school levels in accord with state educational requirements.</p>
			
<p>In Argentina, each province develops its own educational policy. In 
the case of the province of Neuqu&eacute;n, teaching computer science at 
elementary schools is not obligatory. Actually, computer science is an 
extracurricular subject.</p>
			
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Our school advocates the ideals of solidarity, honesty, excellence in 
education, the observance of law, the constant search for truth, justice 
and love in all daily activities. Using and teaching proprietary 
software was in contrast with these values. School directors and 
teachers were also overwhelmed by software license management and by the 
many restrictions that the terms of those licenses imposed on the 
school.</p>

<p>Educational quality and long term goals were also taken into account 
during the decision process. It is our understanding that training 
students on how to use a specific brand of software is far from the 
mission of a school.</p>
			
<h3>How We Did It</h3>

<p>The whole process lasted four years: we started in 2006 with all our 
work stations using proprietary software and concluded in 2010 with full 
free operating systems and programs in all the school's computers, 
including the administration offices and the library.</p>

<p>The plan consisted mainly of several measures aimed at raising 
awareness about the philosophical, ethical and socio-political 
implications of the use of technology. This fundamental aspect was 
maintained and underlined during the whole process and put into practice 
by the gradual substitution of existing proprietary programs with Free 
Libre Software programs.</p>

<p>During the first year we introduced some theoretical courses, namely 
"Computer Science History" and "Introduction to Computer Architecture". 
We also covered the legal aspects of software such as the various types 
of licenses, and we talked about the commitment of Free Software users 
and developers to the community.</p>

<p>Training courses were given to high school level teachers in the IT 
and all other areas, to teachers of the elementary level, to the Board 
of Directors and administration staff, and to the librarian.</p>

<p>The following human resources were employed to carry out the 
migration: </p>
			
<ul>
  <li>1 Computer Science teacher for the pre-elementary and elementary 
  levels. This teacher is also in charge of maintaining the computers
  in the classroom and qualifying other teachers and school staff in the 
  use of the operating system.</li>
  <li>5 Computer Science teachers for the high school Level.</li>
		<li>1 PC and network technician in charge of repairing the computers 
		of the high school level.</li>
		<li>1 Free Software programmer hired to write the Administrative 
		Management System.</li>
		<li>1 IT Professor hired to qualify the school staff.</li>
</ul>
			
<p>Migration costs were affordable and well within the school's 
budget:</p>
			
<ul>
		<li>PC Repairs: In 2006,  ECEN  hired a computer technician who was 
		provided with Free Software documentation and a DVD of the operating 
		system in use. The school has been working with him since then.</li>
		<li>Training: 60 training hours to qualify the school staff.</li>
</ul>
			
<h3>Commitment to Free Software</h3>

<p>As of 2010, we are using fully free operating systems, non in dual 
boot, as follows:</p>

<ul>
		<li>22 PC  in the pre-elementary and primary classrooms (4-12 years 
		old students)</li>
		<li>24 PC in the high school classrooms (13-17 years old students)</li>
		<li>7 PC in the administration offices</li>
		<li>3 PC in the library</li>
		<li>1 notebook in the video classroom</li>
</ul>
			
<p>Some of the Free Libre programs we use are:</p>

<ul>
		<li>Office automation: 
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/OpenOffice">OpenOffice.org</a></li>
		<li>Typing:

</ul>
			
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>We found the migration experience quite positive and we decided to 
adopt a Free Software environment for all work stations. In October 2009 the school sponsored the Software Freedom Day in the city of San Mart&iacute;n de los Andes.</p>

<p>Although it required dedication and perseverance, the process was pleasant. Now we disseminate what we've learned in order to help other educational communities.</p>

<p>We would like to express our appreciation for the excellent work done to all the people involved in the migration effort.</p>
