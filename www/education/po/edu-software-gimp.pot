"GIMP stands for &ldquo;GNU Image Manipulation Program&rdquo;, a "
"self-explanatory name for an application that processes digital graphics and "
"is part of the GNU Project, meaning that it follows the GNU standards and is "
"released under the <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html\">GNU General "
"Public License</a>, version 3 or later, to ensure maximum protection of "
"users' freedom. It can be used both as a simple tool for basic painting and "
"drawing and as a powerful program for complex tasks such as advanced photo "
"retouching, digital image composition, editing and animation, as well as "
"authoring of original art. Apart from the usual features included in similar "
"programs, GIMP displays an array of highly sophisticated options aimed at "
"computer graphics professionals. It is also multi-platform, and it handles a "
"wide range of formats plus format conversion."

"Mani began his journey towards liberation from social constraints as an "

"led him to actively participate in the formation of a <a "
"href=\"/education/edu-cases-india-ambedkar.html\">grassroots volunteer "
"group</a> in 2007, with the goal of introducing computer knowledge in his "
"slum area in Bangalore through the use of freedom-respecting software. This "
"brought sustained improvement to his community and ultimately a radical turn "
"in his own life."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The group set up a Free Software computer lab in the slum dwelling and Mani "
"learned fast, becoming a teacher himself to help his peers develop better "
"skills in the use of the various applications. He soon acquired a mastery of "
"the advanced techniques of GIMP, and, combining technical knowledge with "
"innate artistic abilities, he produced graphical art that he exhibited and "
"sold. The following three-minutes video portrays Mani's endeavor to learn "
"Free Software."

"&ldquo;First I need to say thanks to the Free Software movement, it allowed "

msgid "Why"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The interests of nonfree software developers are at odds with the needs of "
"users from all segments of society, given that they deny basic human values "
"such as collaboration and sharing. Proprietary software companies deem "
"irrelevant to their profit goals the damage that their policies cause to "
"users of their products."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In complex social structures such as that of India, exclusion of the "
"underprivileged from access to information technologies is just one of the "
"multiple instances of discrimination this sector of society faces at many "
"levels: healthcare, housing, education, employment, to name a few.  Over "
"time, these vulnerable groups have attained a high degree of awareness about "
"the importance of mutual collaboration, a basic human value often forgotten "
"or even dismissed among the educated and affluent spheres of society in all "
"cultures. The principles of sharing and reciprocal concern are deeply rooted "
"in these communities and constitute valuable assets in their struggle for "
"survival. The social bond among its members is solid and strong, a bulwark "
"against the incursion of additional sources of exclusion."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In that scenario, the introduction of proprietary software would not be "
"accepted by these socially committed people since that would result in the "
"imposition of further restrictions on them as computer users.  They would "
"not refrain from installing the software in as many computers as needed or "
"use it as they please, they would not give up their right to access "
"knowledge by studying how computer programs work, they would not sign away "
"their right to modify or distribute the programs and, above all, they would "
"not give up their right to share copies with their neighbors. All of these "
"freedoms are granted to them only by <a "
"href=\"/education//philosophy/free-sw.html\">Free Software</a>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The restrictions imposed on users by proprietary software developers serve "
"to attack other layers of society as well, specially the upper spending "
"classes, since those are their main target. Artists and computer graphics "
"professionals often get trapped in perpetual dependency from a company that "
"may decide at any moment to discontinue the product if it is not profitable "
"any longer; or it may decide to introduce updates that run only on specific "
"platforms &mdash;most likely nonfree. So users have no choice but to keep "
"the old version of the program or else invest in a new operating system."

"&ldquo;With proprietary programs the artist is at the mercy of the software "
"development company. Early in 2003 I used LiveMotion to design my digital 2D "
"and 3D works with interactive pieces. Later that year the company decided to "
"discontinue it so I was left without support for a piece of software on "
"which I had spent my money and my time to learn how to use it. Moreover, "
"whenever proprietary software developers decide to introduce new "
"functionalities, you have to buy an update which often runs on the latest "
"versions of proprietary operating systems only. So you are stuck in a "
"vicious circle completely helpless. It’s frustrating and there’s nothing you "
"can do about it. With Free Software, good projects never die due to the "
"community being able to access the code. Someone else can come along and "
"continue developing the software.&rdquo;"

"The introduction of Free Software in the slum removed the barriers that "
"prevented this marginalized sector of society from accessing knowledge in "
"the field of information technology. It provided these people with the "
"opportunity to unfold innate capabilities that would otherwise have never "
"come to surface. This newly discovered intellectual richness brings benefit "
"and progress not only to the involved individuals themselves and to the "
"local community but to society as a whole, since they have learned how to "
"overcome the detrimental effects of unjust global economic policies and are "
"now ready for a productive life."

"With Free Software, users received all the benefits of digital education "
"without being constrained to compromise their principles. The ethical values "
"of Free Software are in line with and sustain those principles: not only "
"were people free to use the software as they wished, install it in as many "
"machines as they wished, but they were encouraged to copy it and share it "
"with their neighbors in solidarity. Mani has become an artist using GIMP and "
"a student of Computer Science; by now, he has acquired enough knowledge to "
"study the source code and to modify it to meet the needs of his community, "
"if necessary. Software freedom results in redistribution of intellectual and "
"economic wealth, which is not possible where access to knowledge is "
"restricted."

"In less disadvantaged contexts, users of GIMP have benefited from software "
"freedom in many ways. They are no longer subject to arbitrary decisions by "
"proprietary software companies; instead, they belong to a large and strong "
"community where developers do care about their needs and fellow users "
"provide additional support. Apart from the official manuals and tutorials, "
"enthusiastic users publish lots of instructional materials and, due to the "
"availability of the source code, those with programming skills have "
"contributed a number of plug-ins to enhance the performance of the "
"application."

"As a free program under the GNU GPL version 3 or later, no arbitrary "
