"<strong>Knowledge</strong>. Many young students have a talent for "
"programing; they are fascinated with computers and eager to learn how their "
"systems work. With proprietary software, this information is a secret so "
"teachers have no way of making it available to their students. But if it is "
"Free Software, the teacher can explain the basic subject and then hand out "
"the source code for the student to read and learn."

"Computing has become an essential part of everyday life. Digital technology "
"is transforming society very quickly, and schools have an influence on the "
"future of society. Their mission is to get students ready to participate in "
"a free digital society by teaching them the skills to make it easy for them "
"to take control of their own lives.  Software should not be under the power "
"of a software developer who unilaterally makes decisions that nobody else "
"can change. Educational institutions should not allow proprietary software "
"companies to impose their power on the rest of society and its future."

"Schools have an ethical responsibility to teach strength, not dependency on "
"a single product or a specific powerful company. Furthermore, by choosing to "
"use Free Software, the school itself gains independence from any commercial "
"interests and it avoids vendor lock-in."

"Proprietary software companies use schools and universities as a springboard "
"to reach users and thus impose their software on society as a whole. They "
"offer discounts, or even gratis copies of their proprietary programs to "
"educational institutions, so that students will learn to use them and become "
"dependent on them. After these students graduate, neither them nor their "
"future employers will be offered discounted copies.  Essentially, what these "
"companies are doing is they are recruiting schools and universities into "
"agents to lead people to permanent lifelong dependency."

"Free software licenses do not expire, which means that once Free Software is "
"adopted, institutions remain independent from the vendor.  Moreover, Free "
"Software licenses grant users the rights not only to use the software as "
"they wish, to copy it and distribute it, but also to modify it in order to "
"meet their own needs. Therefore, if institutions eventually wish to "
"implement a particular function in a piece of software, they can engage the "
"services of any developer to accomplish the task, independently from the "
"original vendor."

"When deciding where they will study, more and more students are considering "
"whether a university teaches computer science and software development using "
"Free Software. Free software means that students are free to study how the "
"programs work and to learn how to adapt them for their own needs. Learning "
"about Free Software also helps in studying software development ethics and "
"professional practice."

"This is an obvious advantage that will appeal immediately to many school "
"administrators, but it is a marginal benefit. The main point of this aspect "
"is that by being authorized to distribute copies of the programs at little "
"or no cost, schools can actually aid families facing financial issues, thus "
"promoting fairness and equal opportunities of learning among students."
