"All computer users ought to insist on free software: it gives users the "
"freedom to control their own computers&mdash;with proprietary software, the "
"program does what its owner or developer wants it to do, not what the user "
"wants it to do.  Free software also gives users the freedom to cooperate "
"with each other, to lead an upright life.  These reasons apply to schools as "
"they do to everyone.  However, the purpose of this article is to present the "
"additional reasons that apply specifically to education."

"Free software can save schools money, but this is a secondary benefit.  "
"Savings are possible because free software gives schools, like other users, "
"the freedom to copy and redistribute the software; the school system can "
"give a copy to every school, and each school can install the program in all "
"its computers, with no obligation to pay for doing so."

"This benefit is useful, but we firmly refuse to give it first place, because "
"it is shallow compared to the important ethical issues at stake.  Moving "
"schools to free software is more than a way to make education a little "
"&ldquo;better&rdquo;: it is a matter of doing good education instead of bad "
"education.  So let's consider the deeper issues."

"Schools have a social mission: to teach students to be citizens of a strong, "
"capable, independent, cooperating and free society.  They should promote the "
"use of free software just as they promote conservation and voting.  By "
"teaching students free software, they can graduate citizens ready to live in "
"a free digital society.  This will help society as a whole escape from being "
"dominated by megacorporations."

"In contrast, to teach a nonfree program is implanting dependence, which goes "

"Why, after all, do some proprietary software developers offer gratis "
"copies<a href=\"#note1\">(1)</a> of their nonfree programs to schools? "
"Because they want to <em>use</em> the schools to implant dependence on their "
"products, like tobacco companies distributing gratis cigarettes to school "
"children<a href=\"#note2\">(2)</a>.  They will not give gratis copies to "
"these students once they've graduated, nor to the companies that they go to "
"work for."

"Free software permits students to learn how software works.  Some students, "
"natural-born programmers, on reaching their teens yearn to learn everything "
"there is to know about their computer and its software.  They are intensely "

"Proprietary software rejects their thirst for knowledge: it says, &ldquo;The "

"Free software encourages everyone to learn. The free software community "
"rejects the &ldquo;priesthood of technology&rdquo;, which keeps the general "

"Schools that use free software will enable gifted programming students to "
"advance.  How do natural-born programmers learn to be good programmers? They "
"need to read and understand real programs that people really use.  You learn "
"to write good, clear code by reading lots of code and writing lots of code.  "
"Only free software permits this."

"How do you learn to write code for large programs? You do that by writing "
"lots of changes in existing large programs.  Free Software lets you do this; "
"proprietary software forbids this.  Any school can offer its students the "
"chance to master the craft of programming, but only if it is a free software "
"school."

"The deepest reason for using free software in schools is for moral "
"education. We expect schools to teach students basic facts and useful "
"skills, but that is only part of their job. The most fundamental task of "
"schools is to teach good citizenship, including the habit of helping "
"others. In the area of computing, this means teaching people to share "
"software.  Schools, starting from nursery school, should tell their "
"students, &ldquo;If you bring software to school, you must share it with the "
"other students.  You must show the source code to the class, in case someone "
"wants to learn.  Therefore bringing nonfree software to class is not "
"permitted, unless it is for reverse-engineering work.&rdquo;"

"Of course, the school must practice what it preaches: it should bring only "
"free software to class (except objects for reverse-engineering), and share "
"copies including source code with the students so they can copy it, take it "

"Teaching the students to use free software, and to participate in the free "
"software community, is a hands-on civics lesson.  It also teaches students "
"the role model of public service rather than that of tycoons.  All levels of "
"school should use free software."

"If you have a relationship with a school &mdash;if you are a student, a "
"teacher, an employee, an administrator, a donor, or a parent&mdash; it's "
"your responsibility to campaign for the school to migrate to free software.  "
"If a private request doesn't achieve the goal, raise the issue publicly in "
"those communities; that is the way to make more people aware of the issue "
"and find allies for the campaign."
