"Software freedom has an especially important role in education.  Educational "
"institutions of all levels should use and teach Free Software because it is "
"the only software that allows them to accomplish their essential missions: "
"to disseminate human knowledge and to prepare students to be good members of "
"their community. The source code and the methods of Free Software are part "
"of human knowledge. On the contrary, proprietary software is secret, "
"restricted knowledge, which is the opposite of the mission of educational "
"institutions. Free Software supports education, proprietary software forbids "
"education."

"Free Software is not just a technical question; it is an ethical, social, "
"and political question. It is a question of the human rights that the users "
"of software ought to have. Freedom and cooperation are essential values of "
"Free Software. The GNU System implements these values and the principle of "
"sharing, since sharing is good and beneficial to human progress."
