<h2>Educational Free Software</h2>

<div class="emph-box">
<p>Before addressing the subject in this section, we would like to 
remind our readers that the word "Free" in "Free Software" <strong>does 
not refer to price</strong> but to <strong>liberty</strong>. Free 
Software is software that grants you <strong>freedom</strong>, namely
the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the 
software. To learn more, see the <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">
Free Software definition</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>What you will find in this section</h3>

<p>These pages do not constitute an exhaustive listing of available 
educational free programs. Our aim is to present some examples so as to
illustrate how educational institutions can put into practice and 
effectively apply the freedoms that Free Software grants them. For each 
program described, we will show how those freedoms were actually 
applied. </p> 

<p>The following are the examples that we present:</p>

<!-- begin adding programs in alphabetical order -->

<p>
<a href="/education/edu-software-gcompris.html">GCompris</a> | 
<a href="/education/edu-software-gimp.html">GIMP</a> |
<a href="/education/edu-software-tuxpaint.html">Tux Paint</a> 
</p>

<!-- end adding programs -->

<p>Some of the programs presented here, like GCompris, are part of the 
GNU Project. This means that developers of these programs agree to pay 
attention to making the program work well with the rest of the 
GNU System. A GNU program uses the latest version of the license that 
the GNU Project recommends in order to protect the users' fundamental 
freedoms. A GNU program does not recommend the use of any nonfree 
program, and it does not refer the user to any nonfree documentation 
for Free Software, as defined in our campaign for 
<a href="/philosophy/free-doc.html">free documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You can also check the <a href="/software/free-software-for-education.html">
list of educational software</a> that we recommend.</p>

<p>People who wish to migrate to Free Software or are looking for a free 
libre program to accomplish a particular task, should refer to the 
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org">Free Software Directory</a>, which 
consists of a catalog of more than 6,000 free programs that run on 
<a href="http://gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">free operating 
systems</a>. In particular, the 
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/category/educ/">Education</a> section 
of the Directory lists programs inherent to different levels of 
education, from pre-elementary school to highly specialized levels, 
including university and research.</p>

<p>If you know of a Free Software program that is being used by an 
educational institution for specific purposes, or has been modified or 
otherwise adapted by its users to meet their own educational needs, 
please let us know by sending an email to
