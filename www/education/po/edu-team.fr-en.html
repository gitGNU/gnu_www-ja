<a href="/education/education.html">Education</a> &rarr; The Education Team</p>
		
<p>The Education Team was initially created to carry out the task of 
building a section within the gnu.org website to specifically address 
the importance of using Free Software in the education field. We believe 
that the achievements of the <a href="/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">GNU 
Project</a> must be applied to all areas of education if they are to 
have an effective positive influence on society as a whole.</p>

<p>The Team provides an answer to the need for a comprehensive 
approach to the adoption of <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">
Free Software</a> by educational institutions. Along with technical 
support and availability of adequate free educational software, an 
improved understanding of the fundamentals of the 
<a href="/philosophy/philosophy.html">GNU philosophy</a> will 
significantly aid the decisional process at times when schools and 
universities are considering the possibility of installing or migrating 
to Free Software. For this reason, we aim at emphasizing the importance 
of the ethical principles of Free Software since they are in line with 
the goals of educational institutions of all levels. This approach will 
ensure success and effectiveness of the migration experience over time. 
Raising awareness about these principles is the main goal of our 
Team.</p>

<p>We oppose any measures undertaken by governments or educational
institutions to impose the use of proprietary software and standards
in the school. We stand up for the right of teachers and students to
use Free Software at school.</p>

<p>With our work, we also want to provide evidence that the freedoms 
granted by Free Software live not in the realm of abstract theories but 
can be exercised by all users, including educational institutions. 
Universities and schools can and should put those freedoms to good use, 
and our aim is to show how.</p>  
		
<p>With those objectives in mind, the Team intends to perform the 
following tasks:</p>
		
<ul>
		<li>Present cases of educational institutions around the world who 
			are successfully using and teaching Free Software.</li>
			
		<li>Show examples of how free programs are being used by educational 
    institutions to improve the learning and teaching processes.</li>
			
		<li>Publish articles on the various aspects involved in the use of 
			Free Software by educational institutions.</li>
			
		<li>Maintain a dialogue with teachers, students and administrators of  
   educational institutions to listen to their difficulties and provide 
   support.</li>
			
		<li>Keep in contact with other groups around the world committed to 
			the promotion of Free Software in education.</li>
</ul>
		
<p>If you are interested in our work and wish to help, if you have any 
questions or suggestions, or if you know of educational institutions 
around the world who follow the GNU philosophy and have successfully 
implemented Free Software, please drop us a note at 
<a href="mailto:education@gnu.org">&lt;education@gnu.org&gt;</a>.</p>
