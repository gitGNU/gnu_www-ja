"Guri is a group which was born inside an Italian High School as the result "
"of a program carried out by NGO Hipatia to raise awareness about the role of "
"Free Software in the education field. Guri opposes the growing practice of "
"treating knowledge as if it were a tangible object subject to ownership. It "
"fights to change the mainstream cultural framework in Italy which prevents "
"the exercise of some of the most important human rights by posing dangerous "
"threats to our freedom such as software patents, unfair copyright laws, and "
"the adoption of proprietary, subjugating software."

"The goals of the Guri project are to convert the educational system so that "
"it is based exclusively on Free Software and to extend the freedoms it "
"grants to every field of knowledge. Guri believes in the power of education "
"to shape a better society by teaching students the values of sharing and "
"cooperation. It advocates and works towards a non-pyramidal system to share "
"knowledge as a fundamental good for humanity, a system in which everyone can "
"participate actively and access knowledge without restrictions."
