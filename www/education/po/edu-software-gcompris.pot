"GCompris is a cross-platform complete educational suite for children from 2 "
"to 10 years old, and it is part of the GNU project. It includes more than 40 "
"entertaining activities that help little kids learn skills such as the "
"recognition of letters and numbers, the use of the mouse and keyboard, basic "
"algebra training, reading time on an analog clock, vector drawing, language "
"learning through games, and much more. The program includes a simple text "
"processor to produce documents with basic text style. Another feature is the "
"animation tool, which can be employed as a simple and effective method to "
"support story telling, thus improving communication with children and "
"helping them to express themselves."

"Each activity in GCompris is a \"board\". Boards are grouped on a yellow bar "
"to the left of the screen, from which the child can choose as soon as the "
"program is started. The design based on boards makes it easy to add new "
"activities or to adapt the program to specific needs.  The program itself "
"and all boards are available in many different languages."

"GCompris is used by a large number of schools around the world with "
"excellent results. It is interesting reading the many <a "

"submitted by teachers of all grades who are using the program."

"Its board-based design makes it highly and easily adaptable to particular "
"environments. One example of innovative use of GCompris is in the work done "
"by the <a href=\"http://insight.kerala.gov.in/\">Insight Project</a> of "
"Kerala, in India. The project aims to bring the benefits of Free Software to "
"differently abled people in the State. They found that GCompris is a "
"powerful tool to improve the communicative and motor skills of mentally "
"challenged persons like children with autism. The project is using and "
"adapting the program for the particular needs of its target community."

"The Insight team implemented a training module for teachers that provides "
"instructions on how to use the different activities of GCompris when working "
"with children with special needs, to help these children acquire abilities "
"such as eye-hand coordination, memory, listening, and improving the child's "
"attention span. The module addresses different levels of education, from "
"pre-school to the primary level. A small handbook was also distributed to "
"parents and special educators to help them understand how to use the "
"software to improve children's skills."

"GCompris is also used to help older children understand the relationship "
"between numbers, learn basic arithmetic operations, train them in analytical "

"Teachers report that it is extremely easy for them to implement GCompris in "
"their curriculum since children find it intuitive and fun to use. The "
"program is also an excellent resource for mentally challenged children and "
"adults."

msgid ""
"GCompris has become an important resource to speed up the child's learning "
"process in the context of developing countries like India, where the only "
"chance for a child of getting accustomed with computers is during school "
"time. At school, the computers are often shared and children have limited "
"time to access them individually. GCompris is easy to use and intuitive, so "
"it is particularly useful in this environment because there is practically "
"no time spent on getting to understand how the program works. With GCompris "
"children develop quickly the motor skills required to use a computer."

"GCompris respects the users' fundamental freedoms and this permitted the "
"Insight developers and specialists to adapt the software to the children's "
"needs, creating new activities and boards, and proposing the innovative use "
"of the program to help autistic children and their parents. The Insight team "
"is also free to distribute copies of the modified version to teachers and "
"parents, who can use the program at home without restrictions. The modified "
"version has proved effective in improving the academic and functional flair "
"of intellectually challenged children."
