<p>The following information was submitted to us by the group of volunteers working at the Center.</p>
			
<div class="edu-cases">
			
<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The Center is located in the Sudharshan Layout off Bannerghatta Road
in Bangalore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka#Education">
State of Karnataka</a>, India.</p>
			
<h3>About</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://slumdweller.wikispaces.com/Community+Computing+Center">
Ambedkar Community Computing Center</a> is not a private or public 
educational institution, it is a computing education center run by 
youths from a local group called Ambedkar Sanga that works in the slums 
of the area.</p>

<p>The Center was founded in 2007 in an effort to bring the world of 
computers close to underprivileged children and youths who otherwise 
would have little opportunity to get in contact with this technology.</p>

<p>The group consists of around 15 children and young boys and girls 
from 13 to 23 years old. They attend classes 3 times a week for 2 hours 
each session.</p> 
			
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The area in which this Center is located lacks even the most basic 
living conditions. We feel that the kids from this place should get a 
good thirst for Freedom while learning computing too, and Free Software 
serves this purpose. Free Software is a way to talk about Freedom.</p>

<h3>How We Did It</h3>

<img src="/education/misc/ambedkar-sm.jpg" alt="Image of a student handing 
a copy of the essay 'The Future is Ours' to Richard Stallman."/></a>

</div>

<p>No migration process was involved. We are Free Software advocates so 
we started directly by installing Free Software in all computers in use; 
therefore, we haven't  faced any particular difficulties in setting up 
the systems. Our main difficulty regards the lack of hardware. We use 
only laptops, and we need as many as we can get. We rely on donations 
for our work.</p>
			
<h3>Commitment to Free Software</h3>

<p>We have five work stations, all of which are laptops and all of them 
run fully free operating systems.</p>
			
<p>All of the programs we use are Free Libre software. For example, we 
use <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> for 
spreadsheets and for general document writing, and 
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GIMP">GIMP</a> for graphics.</p>
			
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Browsing the web using Free Software helps these young boys and girls 
to have access to the external world in safety and confidence. Free 
Libre graphic programs such as GIMP allow them to express their 
creativity freely and easily.</p>
			
<p><a href="/education/edu-software-gimp.html#Mani">One of the 
underprivileged kids</a> who attends classes at the Center has achieved 
a high level of skill in the use of GIMP. His works have been presented 
and sold at a local Free Software conference. The picture on the right 
shows him handing in to Richard Stallman a copy of an essay titled 
&ldquo;The Future is Ours&rdquo;, which was produced at the Center.</p>
                         
<p>Some of the kids who attend our classes also take computing courses 
at school. They report that the skills they learn at the Center are of 
invaluable help for them to follow and pass those courses 
successfully.</p>
