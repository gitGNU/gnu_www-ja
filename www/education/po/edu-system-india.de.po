"In ancient times, India had the Gurukula system of education in which anyone "
"who wished to study went to a teacher's (Guru) house and requested to be "
"taught. If accepted as a student by the guru, he would then stay at the "
"guru's place and help in all activities at home. This not only created a "
"strong tie between the teacher and the student, but also taught the student "
"everything about running a house. The guru taught everything the child "
"wanted to learn, from Sanskrit to the holy scriptures and from Mathematics "
"to Metaphysics. The student stayed as long as she wished or until the guru "
"felt that he had taught everything he could teach. All learning was closely "
"linked to nature and to life, and not confined to memorizing some "

"economic growth and the acute scarcity of skilled and trained manpower must "
"certainly have played a role to make the government take such a step. The "

"The second central scheme is the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education "

"the Chairmanship of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the then Minister for "
"Education. The main purpose of the conference was to consider the "
"replacement of the overseas Cambridge School Certificate Examination by an "
"All India Examination. In October 1956 at the meeting of the Inter-State "
"Board for Anglo-Indian Education, a proposal was adopted for the setting up "
"of an Indian Council to administer the University of Cambridge, Local "
"Examinations Syndicate's Examination in India and to advise the Syndicate on "
"the best way to adapt its examination to the needs of the country. The "
"inaugural meeting of the Council was held on 3rd November, 1958. In December "
"1967, the Council was registered as a Society under the Societies "
"Registration Act, 1860.  The Council was listed in the Delhi School "
"Education Act 1973, as a body conducting public examinations. Now a large "

"Kerala has also always shown interest in trying out ways of improving its "

"Kerala that tried it out first. The state experimented with the District "
"Primary Education Programme (DPEP) with gusto, though there was opposition "

"state was the first in the country to move from the traditional behaviorist "
"way of teaching to a social constructivist paradigm. It was mentioned in the "
"National Curriculum Framework of NCERT in the year 2000, and Kerala started "
"trying it out the next year. The transaction in the classroom and the "
"evaluation methodology were changed.  Instead of direct questions that could "
"be answered only through memorizing the lessons, indirect questions and open "
"ended questions were included so that the student needed to think before "
"answering, and the answers could be subjective to some extent. This meant "
"that the students had to digest what they studied and had to be able to use "
"their knowledge in a specific situation to answer the questions. At the same "
"time, the new method took away a lot of pressure and the children began to "
"find examinations interesting and enjoyable instead of being stressful. A "
"Comprehensive and Continuous Evaluation (CCE) system was introduced along "
"with this, which took into consideration the overall personality of the "
"student and reduced the dependence on a single final examination for "
"deciding promotion to the next class. At present, the CBSE also has "
"implemented CCE, but in a more flexible manner."

"Kerala was also the first state in the country to introduce Information "

"Office. But within one year the government was forced to include Free "
"Software also in the curriculum by protests from Free Software enthusiasts "
"and a favorable stance taken by a school teachers association that had the "
"majority of government teachers as its members. Eventually, from the year "
"2007, only GNU/Linux was taught in the schools, and all computers in schools "
