"The Education Team was initially created to carry out the task of building a "
"section within the gnu.org website to specifically address the importance of "
"using Free Software in the education field. We believe that the achievements "
"of the <a href=\"/gnu/the-gnu-project.html\">GNU Project</a> must be applied "
"to all areas of education if they are to have an effective positive "

"The Team provides an answer to the need for a comprehensive approach to the "
"adoption of <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\"> Free Software</a> by "
"educational institutions. Along with technical support and availability of "
"adequate free educational software, an improved understanding of the "
"fundamentals of the <a href=\"/philosophy/philosophy.html\">GNU "
"philosophy</a> will significantly aid the decisional process at times when "
"schools and universities are considering the possibility of installing or "
"migrating to Free Software. For this reason, we aim at emphasizing the "
"importance of the ethical principles of Free Software since they are in line "
"with the goals of educational institutions of all levels. This approach will "
"ensure success and effectiveness of the migration experience over time.  "
"Raising awareness about these principles is the main goal of our Team."
