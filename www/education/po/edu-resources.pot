"Free learning resources, like Free Software, is a matter of freedom, not "
"price. It's about bringing the principles of Free Software to general "
"knowledge and educational materials. Knowledge should be usable and "
"accessible to all without restrictions and should not be treated as "
"property. It is not an article of consumer goods that decays over time or "
"wears out with use like a pair of shoes. Knowledge is a naturally abundant "
"resource that improves with usage: the more it is used and passed around, "
"the more it grows for the benefit of all. The introduction of measures "
"designed to favor the ownership of knowledge, tailored to prevent people "
"from accessing, using or sharing knowledge, is a conspiracy to inhibit human "
"progress."
