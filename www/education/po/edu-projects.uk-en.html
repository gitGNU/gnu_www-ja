  <dt><a href="http://fsfeurope.org/projects/education/education.en.html">
  FSFE Education Project</a></dt>

  <dd>"FSFE's Education Team exists to raise awareness and bring the
  benefits of Free Software to all groups involved in education. It aims
  for a legal framework that prohibits discrimination against Free
  Software and its users."</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://guri.hipatia.net/">GURI</a></dt>

  <dd>Guri is a group which was born inside an Italian High School as 
  the result of a program carried out by NGO Hipatia to raise awareness 
  about the role of Free Software in the education field. Guri opposes 
  the growing practice of treating knowledge as if it were a tangible 
  object subject to ownership. It fights to change the mainstream 
  cultural framework in Italy which prevents the exercise of some of 
  the most important human rights by posing dangerous threats to our 
  freedom such as software patents, unfair copyright laws, and the 
  adoption of proprietary, subjugating software.

   <p>The goals of the Guri project are to convert the educational 
   system so that it is based exclusively on Free Software and to extend 
   the freedoms it grants to every field of knowledge. Guri believes in 
   the power of education to shape a better society by teaching students 
   the values of sharing and cooperation. It advocates and works towards 
   a non-pyramidal system to share knowledge as a fundamental good for 
   humanity, a system in which everyone can participate actively and 
   access knowledge without restrictions.</p>

   <p>To achieve its goals, the group takes action mainly in High School 
   and University environments, organizing workshops and courses to 
   promote awareness about the ethical principles of Free Software.</p>

   <dt><a href="http://hipatia.net/">Hipatia</a></dt>

   <dd>Hipatia is an international NGO (non-governmental organization) 
   that upholds the right of all human beings to access, use, create,
   modify and distribute knowledge. It is formed by people from all 
   around the world who advocate the ideals of the Free Software 
   movement and work towards putting those principles into practice.
   Hipatia emphasizes the importance of using Free Software in education;
   to that end, its members often conduct workshops in educational
   institutions, specially in primary and secondary level schools.

   <p>The name of the group refers to the Greek philosopher  
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia">Hypatia.</a></p>

   Software for the educational system and the classroom. It was born in 
   France but its members collaborate and work together towards common 
   goals from all over the world by using the internet as a means of 
   communication. Open and frank collaboration between teachers, 
   software developers, translators and authors has always been the key 
   to the success of OFSET's activities.

   program widely used for teaching geometry. OFSET has also developed
