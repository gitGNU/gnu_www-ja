<h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
<p>
Think about a computer. What do you see? You maybe see a monitor, a mouse, a 
keyboard and a computer case. All these things are physical. You can touch them 
with your hand. That means that they are material. All these things are called 
hardware. Other hardware components of a computer is the processor (the brain of
 the computer), different kind of chips and the motherboard for example. You 
will not be able to do many things only using the hardware. You need software. 
You need an operating system with different programs that you can use.

An operating system, as we use the term, means a collection of programs that are
 sufficient to use the computer to do a wide variety of jobs. A general purpose 
operating system, to be complete, ought to handle all the jobs that many users 
may want to do. For example, if you want to download a file from the Internet, 
you need to have an operating system which contains a program that can dowload 
files from the Internet. Software, programs and operating systems are not 
physical. They are just data. They are codes. You could compare it to feelings,
musical compositions or literary works.
</p>
<p>
There are many different operating systems. You have maybe heard about Windows, 
DOS or Mac OS. These are all proprietary (non-free) operating systems. You are 
not allowed to use, change, share or study them freely. You do not have the 
freedom you deserve when you are using them. There are free operating systems 
though. One of them is the GNU operating system. You may use GNU for whatever 
purpose you want to. You may change it, share it with others (including changed 
versions) and study how it works. These are all basic freedoms that every 
computer user in the world should have.
</p>
<p>
A kernel is the central part of an operating system. The kernel of GNU is HURD 
but it is not done yet so most people that use GNU use the Linux kernel.
