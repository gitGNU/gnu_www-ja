<h2>What is the difference between free and gratis?</h2>
<p>
Free (or gratis) things can be very fun. You can get a free ice cream or a free 
toy. Let's say you get an entrance ticket for free to an amusement park with 
many rides such as roller coasters and carousels without having to pay anything 
for it. There is nothing wrong with that. That is fun! However, if you aren't 
allowed to ride the carousels or the roller coasters while you are in there, how
 fun is it and how free are you?

<small>Amusement parks are fun if you have the freedom to test the 
different rides.</small>
<p>
The word &ldquo;free&rdquo; is a homonym. It has at least two different 
meanings. One meaning is that something is obtainable without payment (as in 
free ice cream). Another meaning is that you have the freedom to do certain 
things (as in free from imprisonment or slavery). Many languages have two 
separate words for &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in freedom and &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in
zero price. For example, French has &ldquo;libre&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;gratuit&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
When we talk about free software, we talk about free as in freedom, not as in 
gratis. You are allowed to both distribute copies of a free program for a fee or
distribute it for free (as in gratis).</b>
