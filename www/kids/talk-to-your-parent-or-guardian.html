<h2>Talk to Your Parent or Guardian</h2>
<p>
Do you have a personal computer that belongs to your family at home? Does it use
proprietary or non-free software? If so, consider talking to your parent or 
guardian about it. You could say to hir (her or him) about it. There is a list 
on this page about things you can say to hir.
</p>
<ul>
<li>We should use free software on our computer because then we're not 
requested to agree to a contract before running it. We may use free software for
 any purpose.</li>
<li>We can study how the program works if it is free software. Access to 
the source code is fun and it lets us learn more about how the 
software works. This freedom lets us change the program so it fits our 
needs.</li>
<li>We are allowed to share free software with our neighbours and friends. 
They may also share it to us. We can earn money on doing that. We will not 
be put in prison if we share it.</li>
<li>We are allowed to improve free software and make it better. We can then
 distribute it to others. THen we help others and the community. I think 
that cooperation should be encouraged.</li>
