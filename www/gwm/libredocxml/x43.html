<P
>&#13;In order to protect these freedoms, software licenses have been developed, to 
ensure that the software is able to meet the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Libre"</SPAN
> qualifications. The license also protects these programs from becoming proprietary, or commercial, whereby the source code becomes closed off from the user.
</P
>

<P
>&#13;Licenses have also been developed for Libre Documentation, most notably the GNU Free Documentation License, or FDL. Other documentation licenses include the 
FreeBSD Documentation License, Apple's Common Documentation License, and the 
Open Publication License, however it must be stated that some are restrictive 
and not compatible with the GNU FDL.

<P
>&#13;The GNU Free Documentation License states its purpose clearly in the preamble, 
which is quoted below:

<P
>&#13;The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written 
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective 
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either 
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the 
author and the publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being 
considered responsible for modifications made by others. 
This license is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the 
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU 
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
