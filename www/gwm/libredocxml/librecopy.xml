<sect1>
<title>Libre Documentation and Libre Software Defined</title>
<para></para>
<para>In order to better understand what is meant by the term <quote>Libre Documentation,</quote> we need to explore what Libre means.  To better illustrate this, let us look at the definition of Libre from a <quote>Libre Software</quote> standpoint. Libre Software is also known as <quote>Free Software,</quote> but this is usually where the definition becomes skewed.
</para>

<para> 
What most people define as free software is not necessarily really free because it may be restricted, in that the user may not have access to the source code. The term <quote>free</quote> with respect to software and documentation is often misinterpreted to mean <quote>gratis</quote>, or free of cost.
</para>

<para> 
In an open source community, this is not an accurate representation of free 
software, so instead, the term Libre is used. In Spanish and French, Libre, as 
opposed to Gratis, indicates liberty or freedom rather than price. 
In order for a software application to be considered Libre, these following 
conditions need to be met:
</para>

<orderedlist>
 <listitem>
	<para>The user has the liberty or freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</para>
 </listitem> 
 <listitem>
	<para>The user has the liberty to understand how the program works and adapt it to  his or her needs. This means the source code of the program is available to view and edit.</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
	<para>The user has the liberty to make improvements to the software and release those improvements to the public, for the benefit of the entire community.</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
	<para>The user has the liberty to redistribute copies or modified copies of the program.</para>
 </listitem>
</orderedlist>
 
<para>
Likewise, for Libre Documentation, the same definition applies. Libre 
Documentation is documentation that one can copy or enhance as long as these 
inherent freedoms are met. In addition, for documentation to be classified as 
Libre, we need to consider the following:</para>

<orderedlist> 
 <listitem>
	  <para>Documents should come with a human readable and editable source (html, txt, xml are ok, pdf dvi or ps are not, since they cannot be edited without proprietary software).</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
	  <para>They should be copylefted so that new versions can be created from the exisiting base, just like a software fork.</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
	  <para>They may be sold, or given away - this freedom should not be impaired by additional requirements (such as 'no commercial printing allowed').</para>
 </listitem>
</orderedlist>
</sect1>

<sect1>
    <title>Protecting Documentation and Software with Licenses</title>

<para>
In order to protect these freedoms, software licenses have been developed, to 
ensure that the software is able to meet the <quote>Libre</quote> qualifications. The license also protects these programs from becoming proprietary, or commercial, whereby the source code becomes closed off from the user.
</para>

<para>
Licenses have also been developed for Libre Documentation, most notably the GNU Free Documentation License, or FDL. Other documentation licenses include the 
FreeBSD Documentation License, Apple's Common Documentation License, and the 
Open Publication License, however it must be stated that some are restrictive 
and not compatible with the GNU FDL.
</para>

<para>
The GNU Free Documentation License states its purpose clearly in the preamble, 
which is quoted below:
</para>
 
<blockquote>
<para>0. PREAMBLE</para>

<para>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written 
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective 
freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either 
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the 
author and the publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being 
considered responsible for modifications made by others. 
This license is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the 
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU 
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</para>
</blockquote>

<para>The GNU FDL is included in its entirety at the end of this article.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Copyright vs. Copyleft</title>

<para>
Copyrights exist in order to protect authors of documentation or software from 
unauthorized copying or selling of their work. A copyright infers that only with the author's permission may such activities take place.
</para>

<para> 
A Copyleft, on the other hand, provides a method for software or documentation 
to be modified, and distributed back to the community, provided it remains 
Libre.
</para>

<para> 
In the case of Libre Documentation, an author can place his or her copyright 
into the document, and use distribution terms, such as those in the GNU Free 
Documentation License, which gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and 
redistribute the code, but only if those distribution terms remain unchanged. 
This ensures that the source code and the freedoms are legally inseparable. This is known as "copyleft".
</para>

<para> 
If a program or document was uncopyrighted and in the public domain, changes 
could be made and the program or document could be re-distributed as a 
proprietary product. The copyleft ensures that not only is the original source 
free, but that all modifications must be made free, and permission is granted 
for all who follow in modifying that same program or document, provided they 
abide by these terms.
</para>

<para> 
Applying a free software or free documentation license to an application or 
document qualifies the product as Libre, and protects the open source community at large from it becoming commercial or proprietary.

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
<para>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed 
by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this 
License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
</para>

<para> 
A <quote>Modified Version</quote> of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
</para>

<para>
A <quote>Secondary Section</quote> is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related 
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall 
subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a 
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
</para>

<para>
The <quote>Invariant Sections</quote> are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
</para>

<para> 
The <quote>Cover Texts</quote> are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
</para>

<para>
A <quote>Transparent</quote> copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent 
modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not <quote>Transparent</quote> is called <quote>Opaque</quote>.
</para>

<para> 
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human 
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that 
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for 
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the 
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes 
only.
</para>
 
<para>
The <quote>Title Page</quote> means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent 
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>2. VERBATIM COPYING</title>
<para>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or 
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the 
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this 
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading 
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>

<para> 
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may 
publicly display copies.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

<para>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the 
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in 
covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must 
also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The 
front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally 
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title 
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
</para>

<para>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you 
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual 
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
</para>

<para>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible 
computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the 
Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has 
access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network 
protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at 
least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or 
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
</para>

<para> 
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>4. MODIFICATIONS</title>

<para>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the 
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified 
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</para>

<blockquote>

<para>  
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if 
  there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</para>
 
<para>
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities 
  responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, 
  together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of 
  its principal authors, if it has less than five).
</para>

<para>
  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified 
  Version, as the publisher.
</para>

<para>
  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</para>

<para>
  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to 
  the other copyright notices.
</para>

<para>
  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this 
  License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
</para>

<para>
  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
</para>

<para> 
  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</para>

<para>
  I. Preserve the section entitled <quote>History</quote>, and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the 
  Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled 
  "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and 
  publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item 
  describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</para>

<para> 
  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public 
  access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network 
  locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These 
  may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if 
  the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</para>

<para>
 K. In any section entitled <quote>Acknowledgements</quote> or <quote>Dedications</quote>, preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
</para>
 
<para>
  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their 
  text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered   part of the section titles.
</para>

<para>
 M. Delete any section entitled <quote>Endorsements</quote>. Such a section may not be 
  included in the Modified Version.
</para>
 
<para>
  N. Do not retitle any existing section as <quote>Endorsements</quote> or to conflict in 
  title with any Invariant Section.
</para>
</blockquote>

<para>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that 
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</para>

<para> 
You may add a section entitled <quote>Endorsements</quote>, provided it contains nothing but 
endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, 
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization 
as the authoritative definition of a standard.
</para>

<para>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage 
of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in 
the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover 
Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the 
Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by 
you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you 
may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission 
from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</para>

<para>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give 
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply 
endorsement of any Modified Version.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

<para>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, 
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that 
you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the 
original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your 
combined work in its license notice.
</para>

<para>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple 
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are 
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the 
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, 
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a 
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of 
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</para>

<para>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled <quote>History</quote> in the 
various original documents, forming one section entitled <quote>History</quote>; likewise 
combine any sections entitled <quote>Acknowledgements</quote>, and any sections entitled 
"Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled <quote>Endorsements.</quote>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

<para>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents 
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License 
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, 
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each 
of the documents in all other respects.
</para>

<para>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it 
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into 
the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding 
verbatim copying of that document. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>

<para>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and 
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, 
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a 
compilation is called an <quote>aggregate</quote>, and this License does not apply to the 
other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their 
being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the 
Document.
</para>

<para> 
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the 
Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, 
the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the 
Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the 
whole aggregate. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>8. TRANSLATION</title>

<para>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute 
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant 
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright 
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in 
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a 
translation of this License provided that you also include the original English 
version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and 
the original English version of this License, the original English version will 
prevail.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>9. TERMINATION</title>

<para>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as 
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
      <title>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

<para>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free 
Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</para>

<para>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any 
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has 
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document 
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version 
ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
