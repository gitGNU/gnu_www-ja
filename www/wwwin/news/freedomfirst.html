<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a   name="x1-1000"></a>Background</h3>

<p class="noindent">As the computer continues to become increasingly
pervasive in our personal, social and working lives, the soul of the
machine--software--is seemingly trapped in a battle of proprietary
ownership.

<p class="indent">   In the early days of computing, it was customary
for programmers to share software. Since the 1970s, however, software
has become proprietary, and users have been prevented from sharing, let
alone modifying, programs. By the 1980s, proprietary software had
become the norm, and the computing community was no longer free to
co-operate in using and altering software for specific needs.
<p class="indent">   Freedom had been lost.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-2000"></a>The Free Software Foundation</h3>
<table width="80%">
 <tr>
  <td>
    <em>The owners of software had erected walls to divide
    us from each other.</em>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>

Those words came from the one person who has zealously campaigned to
safeguard software freedoms--Richard M. Stallman, a celebrated
programmer and an accomplished hacker. (Contrary to popular belief, a
hacker is not an anti-social being. S/he is someone who is passionate,
even obsessive, about programming, as opposed to a cracker, someone who
breaks security on a system, often with malicious intent.)

<p class="indent">   Stallman, then working at <span 
class="cmcsc-10">MIT</span>'s Artificial Intelligence Lab, quit
his job to launch the Free Software Movement in 1984, inspired by the
ideals of American independence: <span  class="cmti-10">freedom,
community and voluntary co-operation, which leads to free</span>
<span  class="cmti-10">enterprise, free speech and free
software</span>. Simultaneously, he started the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>project to develop the free operating
system <span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>(a recursive acronym for
<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span><span  class="cmti-10">'s Not</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Unix</span>).

<p class="indent">   The next year, Stallman founded the Free Software
Foundation (<span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span>), dedicated to promoting
computer users' rights to use, study, copy, modify and redistribute
computer programs.

<p class="indent">   The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>promotes
the development and use of free (as in <span  class="cmti-10">free
speech</span>, and not in the sense of gratis, as in <span 
class="cmti-10">free beer</span>) software and free documentation. In
particular, <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>promotes the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>operating system, used widely today in its
<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span>/Linux variant, based on the Linux
kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. It is estimated that there are over
20 million users of <span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span>/Linux systems
today. These systems are often mistakenly called just `Linux'; calling
them `<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span>/Linux' corrects this
confusion.

<p class="indent">   The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span> (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org/</a>), whose headquarters
is in Boston, Massachusetts, <span  class="cmcsc-10">USA</span>, is a
tax-exempt charity for free software development. It raises funds by
selling <span class="cmcsc-10">GNU CD-ROM</span>s, T-shirts, manuals
and deluxe distributions (all of which users are free to copy and
change), as well as from donations.

<p class="indent">   The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>also helps
to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in
the use of software. The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>believes
that free software is a matter of freedom, not price.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a   name="x1-3000"></a>Free Software in India</h3>

<p class="noindent">A developing country like India has a special stake
in promoting and encouraging the use of free software. For one, India
is economically backward and needs to constantly strive for
cost-effective solutions. For another, the <span 
class="cmti-10">digital divide </span>in India is poised to widen,
given the country's diversity in language and literacy levels, as well
as access to computers and bandwidth. Free software can help bridge
this divide by encouraging solidarity, collaboration and voluntary
community work amongst programmers and computer users.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-4000"></a>And in Kerala</h3>

<p class="noindent">Free software meshes in particularly well with
Kerala's long tradition of democracy, equity and public action. Just as
the State is often held up as a model of equitable social and human
development amidst lacklustre industrial growth, Kerala can leverage
the inherent strengths of free software to evolve into an equitable
Knowledge Society.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a   name="x1-5000"></a>FSF India</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Free Software Foundation of India (<span 
class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA</span>), the official Indian affiliate of the
<span class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span>, will be formally inaugurated by
Richard Stallman at the <span
class="cmti-10"><font color="red">Freedom First!</font></span>
Conference at Trivandrum, Kerala on 20 July 2001.

<p class="indent">   <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA </span>will be the
national agency for the promotion of the use of free software, i.e.
software distributed under the <span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU
</span>General Public Licence (<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU GPL</span>)
or other licences approved by <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span>, in
all domains.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-6000"></a>The Vision of FSF India</h3>

<p class="noindent">Broadly, <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>India
will strive to ensure that free software is strengthened in all
respects so as to form a genuine, credible and viable alternative to
proprietary software for every kind of application.

<p class="indent">   To do so, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>India will:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Promote awareness about free software among the
     general public and, specifically, among programmers and students
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Increase access to free software by users in India
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Promote  the  development  of  local  solutions
     to  local  problems  by empowering local programmers in the use of
     free platforms, tools and technologies
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Provide support to free software by way of
     documentation, expert help or any other means
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Help  organize  training  for  programmers  and
     users  of  free  software platforms and software
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Carry out R&amp;D work for free software solutions
     to suit local requirements
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Provide  services  for  the  free  software
     programmer  community  by,  for example, locating and distributing jobs
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Assist  the  national  and  State  governments  in  all  aspects  relating  to
     free software, such as evolving and maintaining standards; providing a
     quality assurance mechanism for free software; and ensuring the use of free
     software in government and quasi-government milieux
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Provide services such as adjudication and conflict
     redressal within the free  software domain</li></ul>

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-7000"></a>The <span 
    class="cmbxti-10"><font color="red">Freedom First!</font></span>
    Conference</h3>

<p class="noindent">The <span
class="cmti-10"><font color="red">Freedom First!</font></span>
Conference on Free Software and the Inauguration of the Free
Software Foundation of India (<span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA</span>), to
be held at Trivandrum on 20 July 2001, will officially launch <span 
class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA</span>'s activities.

<p class="indent">   Prior to the conference, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA </span>will conduct a tutorial on 19th July 2001 at
Technopark on <span 
class="cmti-10">Emerging Free Software Solutions</span>. The tutorial
will expose participants to a range of applications using Free Software
tools and technologies.

<p class="indent">   At the conference, Richard Stallman himself will
inaugurate <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA</span>. He will also speak
about the purpose, goals, philosophy, methods, status and future
prospects of the<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>operating system,
which, in combination with the kernel Linux, is now used
by an estimated 17 to 20 million users worldwide.

teachers, system administrators, <span  class="cmcsc-10">IT</span>
professionals, and scholars of ethics and philosophy will benefit in
particular, since many of these aspects will be dealt with at the
conference.
