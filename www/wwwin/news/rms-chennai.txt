How to reach MIT?

By Electric Train
=================

The best way to reach MIT is, to catch the electric train (Beach to
Tambaram)  and get down at Chromepet station.   Get off at the station and
cross the tracks (on the bridge) to enter the campus at the back gate
(Hostel gate).  

By Car
======

Chromepet is on the Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road, 4 kms south of the
Airport, but the campus is on the other side of the train tracks from the
road (left if you are going south).  Presently, the railway level crossing
just north of Chromepet Station is under repair. You will have to drive
south of the station on GST Road till you reach the Sanatorium Station,
take the level-crossing there, and come back to the M I T Main Gate. 


By Bus
====== 

There are frequent buses to Chromepet (which is en route to Tambaram) from
Guindy, Saidapet and other stops on Mount Road (Anna Salai). Most of these
buses originate from the bus terminus at Parry's Corner. There are also
buses from Ashok Pillar and other points further to the north.  You have
to get down at Chromepet stop.
