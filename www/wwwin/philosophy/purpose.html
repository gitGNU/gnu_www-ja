<h2>Why we exist</h2>
<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-1000"></a>Background</h3>

<p class="noindent">As the computer continues to become increasingly
pervasive in our personal, social and working lives, the soul of the
machine--software--is seemingly trapped in a battle of proprietary
ownership.

<p class="indent">   In the early days of computing, it was customary
for programmers to share software. Since the 1970s, however, software
has become proprietary, and users have been prevented from sharing, let
alone modifying, programs. By the 1980s, proprietary software had
become the norm, and the computing community was no longer free to
co-operate in using and altering software for specific needs.

<p class="indent">   Freedom had been lost.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-2000"></a>The Free Software
Foundation</h3>

<p>
<em>The owners of software had erected walls to divide
us from each other.</em>

<p>
Those words came from the one person who has zealously campaigned to
safeguard software freedoms--Richard M. Stallman, a celebrated
programmer and an accomplished hacker. (Contrary to popular belief, a
hacker is not an anti-social being. S/he is someone who is passionate,
even obsessive, about programming, as opposed to a cracker, someone who
breaks security on a system, often with malicious intent.)

<p class="indent">   Stallman, then working at <span 
class="cmcsc-10">MIT</span>'s Artificial Intelligence Lab, quit
his job to launch the Free Software Movement in 1984, inspired by the
ideals of American independence: <span  class="cmti-10">freedom,
community and voluntary co-operation, which leads to free</span>
<span  class="cmti-10">enterprise, free speech and free
software</span>. Simultaneously, he started the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>project to develop the free operating
system <span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>(a recursive acronym for
<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span><span  class="cmti-10">'s Not</span>
<span class="cmti-10">Unix</span>).

<p class="indent">   The next year, Stallman founded the Free Software
Foundation (<span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span>), dedicated to promoting
computer users' rights to use, study, copy, modify and redistribute
computer programs.

<p class="indent"> The <span class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>promotes the
development and use of free software and free documentation. In
particular, <span class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>promotes the <span
class="cmcsc-10">GNU </span>operating system, used widely today in its
<span class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span>/Linux variant, based on the Linux
kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. These systems are often mistakenly
called just `Linux'; calling them `<span
class="cmcsc-10">GNU</span>/Linux' corrects this confusion.

<p class="indent">   The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span> (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org/</a>), whose headquarters
is in Boston, Massachusetts, <span  class="cmcsc-10">USA</span>, is a
tax-exempt charity for free software development. It raises funds by
selling <span class="cmcsc-10">GNU CD-ROM</span>s, T-shirts, manuals
and deluxe distributions (all of which users are free to copy and
change), as well as from donations.

<p class="indent">   The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>also helps
to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in
the use of software. The <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>believes
that free software is a matter of freedom, not price.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="x1-5000"></a>FSF India</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Free Software Foundation of India
(<span class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA</span>), the official Indian
affiliate of the <span class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span>, was formally
inaugurated by Richard Stallman at the <span class="cmti-10"><font
color="red">Freedom First!</font></span> Conference at Trivandrum,
Kerala on 20 July 2001.

<p class="indent"><span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF INDIA </span>will
be the national agency for the promotion of the use of 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>,
i.e.  software distributed under the <span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU
</span> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">General
Public Licence</a> (<span  class="cmcsc-10">GNU GPL</span>) or
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">other
licences</a> approved by <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF</span>, in
all domains.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a name="vision"></a>The Vision of FSF India</h3>

<p class="noindent">Broadly, <span  class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>India
will strive to ensure that free software is strengthened in all
respects so as to form a genuine, credible and viable alternative to
proprietary software for every kind of application.

<p class="indent">To do so, <span class="cmcsc-10">FSF </span>India will:

<ul class="itemize1">
  <li class="itemize">Promote awareness about free software among the
  general public and, specifically, among programmers and students
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Increase access to free software by users in India
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Promote  the  development  of  local  solutions
  to  local  problems  by empowering local programmers in the use of
  free platforms, tools and technologies
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Provide support to free software by way of
  documentation, expert help or any other means
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Help organize training for programmers and
  users of free software platforms and software
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Carry out R&amp;D work for free software solutions
  to suit local requirements
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Provide  services  for  the  free  software
  programmer  community  by,  for example, locating and distributing jobs
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">Assist the national and State governments
  in all aspects relating to free software, such as evolving and
  maintaining standards; providing a quality assurance mechanism for
  free software; and ensuring the use of free software in government
  and quasi-government milieux </li>
  <li class="itemize">Provide services such as adjudication and conflict
  redressal within the free  software domain</li>
</ul>
