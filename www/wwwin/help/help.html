<h1>FSF India</h1>
<h2>How you can help us</h2>

<P>
FSF India cannot hope to achieve its goals without the active and
continuous support of volunteers. 

<p>
You can keep abreast of FSF India's activities, and suggest new
activities, by subscribing to the appropriate mailing list.

<p>
As for concrete and immediate help, FSF India needs assistance on the
following fronts:

<h3>Exposure in the mainstream media</h3> 

<P>
We seek the alliance of activist journalists who can help spread
the message of software freedom -- and warn the general public about
the ills of proprietary software -- in the mainstream media. The <a
href="http://mm.gnu.org.in/mailman/listinfo/fsf-friends">fsf-friends
mailing list</a> frequently features free software related issues
which could form the basis of important public interest news stories
and articles. Please consider subscribing to that mailing list or
<a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org.in">get in touch with us</a> if you
are a journalist wanting to write about free software.

<h3><a name="donate">Donations</a></h3>

<P>
An important way of supporting FSF India and the cause of
software freedom is donating money to finance our activities in
pursuit of our <a href="../philosophy/purpose.html#vision">vision</a>.

<p>
You can make a donation by sending a cheque or demand draft drawn
in favour of "Free Software Foundation of India" to:

<p>
The Free Software Foundation of India<br>
TC-27/2207, CHIRAKULAM ROAD,<br>
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM - 695 001,<br>
KERALA

<p>
Please note that for the time being, donations to FSF India are not
tax-deductible. Also, for the time being, we are unable to accept
donations from outside India.

<h3><a name="webdev">Website development and maintenance</a></h3>

<P>
The FSF India website is not only an important source of information
about the organisation, its goals and ongoing activities, but can
also provide valuable web-based services. Its development and
maintenance will, to state the obvious, always be an unending
job in constant need of volunteer assistance. If you think you
can help us on this front, please consider subscribing to our
<a href="http://mm.gnu.org.in/mailman/listinfo/fsf-web">fsf-web
mailing list</a>.

<h3>Logo</h3>

<P>
FSF India needs a logo! The specifications for the logo have been
discussed at length on our 
<a href="http://mm.gnu.org.in/mailman/listinfo/fsf-web">fsf-web mailing
list</a>. Graphic artists willing to help may please take a look at
the archives.
