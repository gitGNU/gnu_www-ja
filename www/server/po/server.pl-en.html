<h2>About GNU Servers</h2>

<p>We have <a href="/server/irc-rules.html">rules for official GNU and FSF IRC
channels</a>.</p>

<p>We have <a href="/server/mirror.html">information and advice for those
wishing to mirror ftp.gnu.org</a>.  (We no longer suggest mirroring
www.gnu.org.)</p>

<p>For designing and authoring our web pages, we follow certain <a
href="/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html">style guidelines</a>.  If you
would like to help, we have a list of <a
href="/server/tasks.html">tasks</a> that need to be done on this web
site.  All our pages are <a
href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/">Best Viewed with Any
Browser</a>.</p>

<p>Just as we do not install proprietary software, we have a policy of
not making links to pages that promote proprietary programs.  We
cannot make proprietary software disappear by not talking about it;
information about proprietary software is widely available, and people
who want it will get it somehow.  But we prefer not to be participants
in the process of advertising proprietary software.</p>

<p>We also confine all links to text that is commercial in its tone to a
few of our pages, where the topic makes such links appropriate.  This
is so we can avoid appearing to share the widespread assumption that
money and business are the highest value in life.</p>

<p>Only <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> is used on
this computer.  The web server is the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache web server</a>,
which is distributed under the Apache license (a free software license).
To support this server,
we also use other free software developed by GNU volunteers
and we maintain a <a href="/server/source/source.html">list of such
software</a>.</p>

<p>We currently host through TowardEX and the Markley Group, who have
graciously donated the bandwidth and colocation space for this
system.</p>

<p>The operating system is Trisquel GNU/Linux, which is one example of a
<a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> system. Trisquel GNU/Linux 
is listed on <a href="/distros/free-distros.html">our list of free 
GNU/Linux-distributions</a>.</p>

  <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">This article
points out an insight</a> that helps explain why we want the sort of
site we want.</p>

<!-- Regarding copyright, in general, standalone pages (as opposed to
     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
