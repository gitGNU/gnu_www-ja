<h2>Tasks to do for www.gnu.org</h2>

<p>
  Here are many possible tasks for improving the GNU web pages.
  If you would like to help with one of them, please e-mail
  <a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">&lt;webmasters@gnu.org&gt;</a>
  BEFORE you do any work on them.
</p>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>

<p>
  Investigate how www.gnu.org could provide better accessibility to
  all regardless of disability.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good place to start is the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility
    Initiative (WAI)</a>.</li>
  <li>Other resources on and off the web could also be checked.</li>
  <li>People at or near MIT could check with MIT's
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu/atic/www/">Adaptive Technology for
    Information and Computing</a> in person.</li>
  <li>People who have access to similar centers at other schools,
    organizations, and companies could check with them.</li>
  <li>Disabled users of the web could also be interviewed, and perhaps
    even added to the webmasters team for this task and others.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="conversions">Format Conversions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We are looking for people to volunteer to convert documentation
  from various formats to the
  <a href="/software/texinfo/texinfo.html">Texinfo</a>
  format. This is something we need
  occasionally. We would like to have a list of people we could ask
  on these occasions. If you want to volunteer, please send mail to
  <a href="mailto:gvc@gnu.org">&lt;gvc@gnu.org&gt;</a>.</li>
  <li>Rewrite the various philosophy pages in
  <a href="/software/texinfo/texinfo.html">Texinfo</a>
  and
  convert to HTML using texi2html.
  They could then be easily included in:
  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/GNUinfo">/gnu/GNUinfo</a>
    subdirectory of
    <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/">ftp.gnu.org</a></li>
    <li>the etc/ subdirectory of the GNU Emacs distribution</li>
    <li>in the GNU system's Info tree</li>
    <li>other useful locations.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing">Writing Web Pages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write web pages for GNU programs that lacks web pages on our server or
  whose web pages are obsolete using our <a
  href="/software/boilerplate_software.html">software boilerplate</a> as a
  template. Also read our <a
  href="/server/standards/README.software.html">software page
  standards</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="valid">Broken Links</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Help is needed 
    <a href="/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#deadlink">repairing 
    broken links</a>.  There are numerous 
    <a href="/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#symlinks">symlinks</a>,
    so please do not break these in your repair efforts.  Time and
    care is needed to track down broken links, and in most
    cases find suitable replacements.  Please ensure that our 
    <a href="/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#addlink">linking</a>
    <a href="/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#pollinking">policy</a> 
    is followed in finding replacements.  
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="l10n">Localization</h3>

<p>Help <a href="/server/standards/README.translations.html">translate
GNU web pages</a> from English into other languages.  You can either
join an existing translation team, or form a new one.  Check the
<a href="/server/standards/README.translations.html#TranslationsUnderway">existing
translation teams</a>.</p>

     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the

     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
