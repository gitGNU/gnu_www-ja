<h3 id="working">Working as a www.gnu.org webmaster</h3>

<p>All active webmasters have access to the <a
href="http://rt.gnu.org/">webmasters RT queue</a>, which corresponds to
the email address <a
href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">&lt;webmasters@gnu.org&gt;</a>.  This
is the primary work queue for webmasters.  Please check the queue
regularly, take a ticket you can handle, handle it, and reply to the
message letting the sender know what has happened, and resolve the
ticket.  See <a href="#rt">RT guidelines</a> below for many details.</p>

<p>All active webmasters should be part of the <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/www/">www</a> project on
savannah, so changes can be committed.  Please join that if you haven't
already.  Most webmaster tasks are performed by checking out the CVS
repository on your local machine, modifying them, and committing the
result.  <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www">Instructions
on how to use CVS</a> (you want the &ldquo;Webpages
repository&rdquo;).</p>

<p>All active webmasters should be on the www-discuss mailing list.  You
should have gotten the subscription and archive information for it when
you joined.  If not, write chief-webmaster.  Additional archives are in
<tt>/com/archive/webmaster*</tt> on fencepost.</p>

<p>There are <a href="readme_index.html">several guides</a> for
webmasters.  Please read them.  One of the most important ones is the <a
href="/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html">FSF HTML Style Sheet
Guidelines</a>.  Please read it.</p>

<p>If you find a message to webmasters@gnu.org that you don't know how
to handle, it's probably best to ignore the message for a while.
However, if you noticed that something has been pending for more than a
few days, it is good to ask the www-discuss list: "Can someone teach me
how to handle messages like this?"</p>

<p>As a general rule, things like this are always okay to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix typos, misspellings, broken links, and the like (a report of
       broken links in <tt>/home/w/wwj/linc/reports</tt> on Fencepost.
       The reports are separated by language code.)</li>
  <li>Requests from Richard Stallman
       <a href="mailto:rms@gnu.org">&lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;</a>,
       John Sullivan <a href="mailto:johns@gnu.org">&lt;johns@gnu.org&gt;</a>,
       or anyone else at the FSF Distribution Office.</li>
  <li>Requests from one of the maintainers of a software package to change
       something on web pages about that software package, if it does not
       seem to conflict with any other webmastering policies.</li>
  <li>Take on one of the <a href="/server/tasks.html">tasks</a> we need
       done for this <a href="/server/server.html">web server</a>.
       Cleaning up that task list would also be appreciated.
       Please inform the www-discuss list if you take a task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes people send mails asking us to make links to different
software packages.  Before making such links, it's important to check
the page that the link points to and make sure that it does not make any
references to non-free software.  When in doubt, it is best to post a
summary of what you found on the page back to the webmasters list (but
not to the requestor!), and ask someone else to take it from there.</p>

<p>We do not have links to web sites of the <a
href="/distros/common-distros.html">well-known</a> GNU/Linux system
distributions, or to the well-known BSD system distributions, because
all those sites explicitly describe, and facilitate access to, various
non-free programs.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might be tempted to rearrange the hierarchy, change the
CSS formatting, layout, tagging, or other such wide-ranging things.
Before doing anything like this, please consult the www-discuss list.</p>


<h4>Webmaster organization</h4>

<p>The following organizational rules are not rigid; they are designed to
serve us and assign responsibility so that things don't fall through the
cracks.  Thus, the policies and escalation procedures need not be followed
to the letter, but if you aren't sure what to do, it's best to follow
these policies.</p>

<p>The GNU Webmaster Group is led by the Chief Webmaster <a
href="mailto:chief-webmaster@gnu.org">&lt;chief-webmaster@gnu.org&gt;</a>.
You can always find out the identity of the Chief Webmaster by looking at
the aliases file on the GNU mail server.</p>

<p>The Chief Webmaster is responsible for making sure that every message sent
to webmasters <a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">&lt;webmasters@gnu.org&gt;
</a> gets handled
eventually.  The Chief Webmaster isn't responsible for handling every
message; just making sure that someone handles them in a timely manner.
The Chief Webmaster is also responsible for training new webmasters, and
doing her best to correct mishandled webmaster email, when necessary.</p>

<p>If it isn't clear to the webmasters how to handle a particular issue, the
message should be sent to the www-discuss mailing list so that
all the webmasters can learn how to handle those issues in the
future.</p>


<h4>Leaving webmasters</h4>

<p>We realize that people's lives change, and we know that you may not want
to be an FSF/GNU webmaster for the rest of your life.  We ask that you let
us know when you want to move on: please don't simply disappear.</p>

<p>When you sign up to be a webmaster, you commit to a certain number of
hours a week of volunteer work.  If you need to drop below that level
for more than a few weeks, or want to stop being a webmaster entirely,
please inform <a
href="mailto:chief-webmaster@gnu.org">
&lt;chief-webmaster@gnu.org&gt;</a> as soon as your situation
changes.</p>


<h3 id="rt">Using RT</h3>

<p>Mail sent to webmasters is stored in a ticket management system
called RT.  This system keeps all correspondence about a given issue
together, makes sure that no requests are lost, and so on.  This section
documents the conventions used by the GNU webmasters.</p>

<p>It is useful to be copied on all RT-related mail: new tickets, other
webmasters' answers to tickets, and so on.  That way we can all learn
from each other.  If you can actively help with handling RT tickets,
please consider this.  A number of people can set up your RT account for
this, just mail www-discuss.</p>

<a name="rtguide"></a>
<h4>RT - quick guide</h4>

<p>First and foremost: use your judgment, rather than blindly following
procedures.  If the action on a particular ticket seems questionable to
you for any reason, email www-discuss or use the &lsquo;Comment&rsquo;
link on the ticket.  That said, most tickets fall into one of a few
categories, so we try to enumerate the common cases here.</p>

<ul>
<li>To see open tickets, visit <a
href="http://rt.gnu.org/">rt.gnu.org</a> and log in with your assigned
RT username/password.  (If you don't have one, email www-discuss.)
There will be a link to the webmasters queue (among lots of other
things) on your RT home page.  Once you see the list, clicking on the
subject link will open the ticket.</li>

<li>If the message is spam, click the &lsquo;Mark as Spam&rsquo; link in
the top row.</li>

<li>If the message is in a language you don't understand and it's not
spam, or you're not sure if it's spam, click &lsquo;Basics&rsquo;, then
change the Queue field to &lsquo;web-translators&rsquo;.</li>

<li>If the message is just a thank-you to us, or something else that
doesn't require action on our part, click &lsquo;Resolve&rsquo;.</li>

<li>If the message is a simple typo or other buglet on a page we
maintain, go ahead and fix it, using &lsquo;Reply&rsquo; to tell the
submitter what you did, and then &lsquo;Resolve&rsquo; it.</li>

<li id="thankgnu">If the message is a ThankGNU:
  <ul>
  <li>For an individual, add it to the appropriate
      <tt>/thankgnus/YYYYsupporters.html</tt> file in the correct place.</li>
  <li>Do not quote the dollar amount in the commit message or anywhere
      else, just the name, ticket number and category.</li>
  <li>For a corporation, confirm with www-discuss first (they can end up
      on separate pages).</li>
  <li>Move the ticket into the 'campaigns' queue after you've updated the Thank GNUs page.</li>
  <li>Do not &lsquo;Reply&rsquo; to sysadmin on these messages;
      they are automatically generated.</li>
  <li>If it is a duplicate of a previous donation, just resolve the
      ticket without making any changes.  The script sending out the
      msgs has bugs.  The occasional case of a person donating the same
      amount twice is handled by FSF staff.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>If the message is about making a link on one of our pages, see
<a href="#pollinking">linking procedures and information</a>.</li>

<li>If the message is about adding a graphic or a joke, be sure to get
the explicit ok for it to be released under a free
license&mdash;GPLv3-or-later and FDLv1.3-or-later is good.  Then make a
new page under <tt>/graphics</tt> resp. <tt>/fun</tt> and add it to the
index page.  rms' requirements for adding items to <tt>/fun</tt> is in
<a href="/fun/README">/fun/README</a>.</li>

<li>If the message is about a mirror, see <a
href="#mirrors">mirror procedures and information</a>.</li>

<li>If the message opened a new ticket, but is actually a follow-up to
an existing ticket, use the &lsquo;Links&rsquo; feature of RT to combine
them.  This happens when the original submitter cc'd the message to
other recipients, and one of the other recipients sends a reply that
includes us&mdash;each such reply will (unfortunately) start a new
ticket.</li>

<li>If the message needs to be dealt with by another group, such as
sysadmin or licensing, move it to the corresponding queue or otherwise
forward it.  <a href="#rtmisdirected">Specific directions for
redirecting tickets</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h4>RT - correspondence vs. comments</h4>

<p>You can attach two kinds of information to a ticket: correspondence and
comments.</p>

<p>Correspondence will be sent to the person who sent the initial report.  Add
correspondence when you want to get more information about the report, give
the requestor more information about the work being done, let them know
it's finished, and so on.</p>

<p>Comments are only seen by the ticket staff: the owner and people listed
as AdminCCs.  You can use comments to make internal notes about ticket
work.  For instance, if you do some work on converting an essay of RMS's to
HTML, but didn't get a chance to finish yet, you could add a comment saying
that you're partially done, so other webmasters know not to work on it
(make sure to leave the ticket marked "open").
You should add something as a comment whenever the original requestor
doesn't need to see it.  Try to make as much correspondence as you can into
comments, however.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the methods for adding either type of correspondence are
very similar, so it's easy to get them confused.  Be careful.</p>

<p>To add correspondence, use one of the "reply" links on the ticket page, or
send mail to &lt;webmasters@gnu.org&gt; with</p>

<pre>
   [gnu.org #1234]
</pre>

<p>in the subject line, where 1234 is the ticket number.</p>

<p>To add comments, use one of the "comment" links on the ticket page, or send
mail to &lt;webmasters-comment@gnu.org&gt; with</p>

<pre>
   [gnu.org #1234]
</pre>

<p>in the subject line, where 1234 is the ticket number.</p>

<p>There is no way to make other modifications except through the
web interface.  However, there are a couple of macro scripts
hanging around for modifying email received in Emacs, or in mbox
format.  Please check with www-discuss for these.</p>

<h4>RT - coordination with others</h4>

<p>You will often need to ask other people for more information about how to
handle a ticket.  If we don't mind showing them a few internals about how
we do things&mdash;in other words, if they're friends of the GNU
project&mdash;the best way to do this is to mail them, and make that
mail a comment to the ticket as well.</p>

<p>So, say for example that you wanted to ask the chief webmaster whether
a certain link on a page was permissible.  You can do this by using
one of the "comments" links on the ticket page, and listing the other
party (in this case, &lt;chief-webmaster@gnu.org&gt;) as a CC:.  You
could also do this by sending a mail with headers like this:</p>

<pre>
    To: &lt;chief-webmaster@gnu.org&gt;, &lt;webmasters-comment@gnu.org&gt;
    Subject: [gnu.org #1234] Question about link policy
</pre>

<p>1234 should be the appropriate ticket number.</p>

<p>The former method is more foolproof: RT will change the outgoing mail so
that the only address the other party sees is RT's, and any reply will be
guaranteed to go into the ticket (also as comments).  The latter is fine if
you're primarily doing work by e-mail, however.</p>


<h4>RT - ticket status</h4>

<p>Here are the possible ticket statuses in RT:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>new</tt> is for tickets which have not had work done on them yet.
RT assigns new tickets this status automatically; there is no need to
explicitly set it.</li>

<li><tt>open</tt> is for tickets which are being worked on.  RT will
automatically give a ticket this status when comments or correspondence
are added; you usually won't need to change a ticket to be open
manually.</li>

<li><tt>resolved</tt> is for tickets whose problems have been addressed.
Do this when you complete the request outlined in the ticket, or
determined it's inapplicable, or otherwise dealt with it.  Until it is
completely addressed, leave it open.</li>

<li><tt>deleted</tt> is for tickets which are spam (and only spam).
This status is set automatically by the &lsquo;Mark as Spam&rsquo;
option in the web interface, which is the most convenient way to handle
spam tickets.</li>

<li><tt>rejected</tt> and <tt>stalled</tt> should not be used.</li>

</ul>

<p>Other considerations regarding tickets' status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feel free to mark tickets as resolved liberally.  If new
correspondence comes in about them, they will automatically be
re-opened.  If it is just a random request for which there is nothing in
particular to do, simply reply as needed and mark it resolved.</li>

<li>However, if a ticket is important, it is best to keep it
open, even when we need more information.  That way, we will keep seeing
it, and remember to push for the necessary information, rather than
forgetting about it.</li>
</ul>


<h4>RT - ticket escalation</h4>

<p>If you'd like to handle a request but aren't sure how to go about it,
or think a request is important and may have been overlooked, leave the
ticket open, and email the www-discuss list.</p>


<a name="rtmisdirected"></a>
<h4>RT - misdirected tickets</h4>

<p>Sometimes people send mail to webmasters which is best handled
elsewhere.  When this happens, you can do one of two things: redirect
the ticket within RT, or forward it in regular email.</p>

<p>If there's an RT queue which is appropriate for the ticket, move it
there.  The ticket's queue can be changed under the &lsquo;Basics&rsquo;
menu item.</p>

<ul>
<li>Move tickets with opinions or inquiries about free software or GNU
    philosophy, help using specific programs, or other such non-web
    site-specific questions, to the info queue.</li>

<li>Move bug reports and other items about the Free Software Directory
    to the directory queue.</li>

<li>Move bug reports about fsf.org pages (broken links, typos, layout)
    to the resources queue.</li>

<li>Move tickets that are about the actual content of fsf.org pages to
    the campaigns queue.</li>

<li>Move tickets that are about FSF memberships to the memberships
    queue.</li>

<li>For tickets about system problems with www.gnu.org (e.g., system
    down, a .symlinks file not creating the symbolic link), try to
    verify the problem and if it is real, move it to the sysadmin
    queue.</li>

<li>Move tickets about a new or existing translation of a gnu.org web page
    to web-translators.  Exception: for happy-birthday-to-gnu subtitles
    and other FSF campaigns pages on gnu.org, handle them
    ourselves.</li>

<li>For tickets about Savannah, email the original message to
    savannah-hackers-private@gnu.org.</li>

<li>Move tickets about licensing to the licensing queue.</li>

<li>Move tickets about accounts to the accounts queue.</li>

<li>Move tickets about the */allgnupkgs.html pages to the maintainers
    queue.</li>

<li>Requests to remove messages from mailing list archives (accessible via
    <a href="http://mail.gnu.org">http://mail.gnu.org</a> should be forwarded
    to &lt;mailman@mail.gnu.org&gt;.</li>

<li>Anything else not related to webmastering&mdash;including questions
    about FSF opinions, requests for support, and the like&mdash;can be
    moved to the info queue.</li>

<li>For tickets about the GNU libc web pages, point the OP to
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html.  That is the best way to
    get the glibc maintainers' attention.</li>

<li>If the ticket is about the web pages for a <a
    href="#gnupackages">specific GNU software package</a>, it is best to
    send it in private email to the maintainers of that package (they
    are recorded in the Free Software Directory, or look at the file
    <tt>/gd/gnuorg/maintainers.bypkg</tt> on fencepost), and reply to
    the OP saying that you did so, resolving the ticket.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's nice to notify a queue's watchers when a ticket is moved; RT
doesn't provide automatic notification.  You can do this by sending mail
to QUEUENAME-comment@gnu.org with the original subject line.  Just a
terse message "Moved ticket 1234 to your queue" suffices.</p>

<p>If there isn't an appropriate RT queue, forward the mail to the
appropriate party, and make a comment indicating that you did so
(perhaps resolving it, if appropriate).  It is usually best not to do
this via the RT cc mechanism.  Instead, forward the message in normal
email.</p>


<h4>RT - spam quarantine</h4>

<p>The spam quarantine is a collection of mails to webmasters@gnu.org
that are caught by our spam filter, and should be checked daily for
false positives.</p>

<p>To do this, use your RT username and password to log in to the <a
href="http://rt.gnu.org/qmanager/webmasters">quarantine manager</a>. The
background of the page is color coded from blue (least likely to be
spam) to red (most likely to be spam). To read an email, click on its
subject. If you find a false positive then click the "Send to RT" button
at the top of the page. When you are satisfied that all of the emails on
the index page are spam, delete them using the "Delete All Message On
This Page" button at the bottom of the index page.</p>

<p>If the quarantine is not checked for several days, RT will synthesize
a ticket in our queue.  When the above is done you should resolve such a
ticket.  It is best not to wait around for the ticket, though, because
webmasters get several hundred spams every day.</p>


<h3 id="structure">Site structure and navigation</h3>

<p>The site is divided up into directories by topic&mdash;there's a
directory for GNU project information and history, a directory for our
licenses, and so on.  Each of these directories has a page sharing the
same name; for example, the /philosophy directory has a page,
philosophy.html.  This page is the main page for this section of the
site, and so should provide access to all the material within that
directory.</p>

<p>In turn, every other page in the directory should link back to this
main page, to allow people to get more information about a given topic.</p>

<p>Links should include a full path, if possible.  For example, within a
specific article in the philosophy section, link to
/philosophy/philosophy.html, rather than just philosophy.html.  This
eases maintenance of the site as things get moved around.</p>

<p>Some pages are dynamic and should include a link with the full
hostname; a notable example is the Free Software Directory.  So, we link
to that with the URL <tt>&lt;http://www.gnu.org/directory&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>Our pages make use of SSI and CSS to do a variety of things.  At
present, our pages should do an include of
<tt>&lt;/server/banner.html&gt;</tt>, as shown in
<tt>&lt;/server/standards/boilerplate.html&gt;</tt>.  This reads
<tt>/style.css</tt>, which in turn reads <tt>/combo.css (Yahoo's User
Interface CSS for <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">reset</a>, <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">grids</a>, <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/">fonts</a> and <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/">base</a></tt> plus
<tt>/layout.css</tt>, which contains gnu.org specific CSS formatting. In
addition, users of mobile devices (cellphones, music players, etc) are
sent to <tt>/mini.css</tt> instead. This stylesheet is just the YUI
reset and base stylesheets, as mobile devices typically have minimal
need for various fonts and no need for fancy layouts.</p>

<p>Historical pages refer to <tt>/gnu.css</tt> which also loads the
mobile CSS, as these pages are usually very basic, plain pages with
little or no formatting.</p>

<h4>A little more on Yahoo's User Interface CSS</h4>

<p>YUI is a project of Yahoo (the search engine company) to provide a
set of standard userfaces for the web. They're licensed under the
modified BSD-license (3 clause), here's a quick run down of what they do:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>reset</dt>
  <dd>As all the major browsers, both free and
  nonfree are different, reset reverts all their specific default CSS
  to a very basic level, allowing the developer to provide her own
  styles, or use a standard library. In our case, we use
  <b>base</b>.</dd>
  <dt>grids</dt>
  <dd>Laying out pages in an
  attractive way can be tricky using CSS -- YUI provides a mechanism
  for this that is pretty attractive. Using the <a
  href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">documentation for
  grids</a>, or the <a
  href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/builder/">interactive
  grids builder</a>, the discerning developer can quickly build
  attractive and functional grid-based layouts, which are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_%28page_layout%29">cornerstone of good typographical practice</a> without resorting to tables, which is considered <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#tables">a bad practice for accessibility</a>.</dd>
  <dt>fonts</dt>
  <dd>Fonts are also a mess on the web, as many gnu.org developers will tell you, we have long wrestled with the problem of how gnu.org should handle fonts. From the original 'no fonts' design, through the many interactions of Matt Lee's current GNU designs, fonts have been an often-debated problem for the site. YUI's fonts takes care of this, by use of much testing on the part of Yahoo.</dd>
  <dt>base</dt>
  <dd>Base does the final part of the job that <b>reset</b> does &mdash; provides a consistent definition for all the major elements on a page. With base, headings, paragraphs and lists are consistent in their margins and padding across all browsers.</dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="announcements">Announcements: directory links, sitemap, home page</h3>

<p>When significant new content is added, notices should be put up to
make people aware of it:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#polnews">Add a News entry</a> (next
section).</li>

<li>When adding a new page, always add a link to the directory's main
page.  For example, if you've created a new page in the <tt>/gnu</tt>
directory, add a link to it from <tt>/gnu/gnu.html</tt>.</li>

<li>If a new page is sufficiently important, add a link on the home
page, <tt>/home.html</tt>.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="polnews">Adding news: whatsnew</h4>

<p>News items are posted by adding a new "News" entry to the 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/www">www project on 
Savannah</a>.</p>

<p>Once that is done there is no need to do anything more.  The News 
item will eventually appear on <a href="http://planet.gnu.org">
http://planet.gnu.org</a>. A cron job run by the Chief Webmaster 
will trigger <a href="/server/source/source.html">planetrss.pl</a> 
to pull new items from the RSS feed and add them to 
<a href="/planetfeeds.html">/planetfeeds.html</a>  
where they are then included in home.html via an SSI Include 
directive. Email www-discuss if something seems to be wrong.</p>

<h3 id="pollinking">Linking policies</h3>

<p>One of the most complex aspects of webmastering is following the linking
guidelines; however, it's also a very crucial aspect of the job.</p>

<p>We strive to ensure that all pages we promote&mdash;all pages which are given
links on our site&mdash;are friendly to the free software movement.  Some
pages will obviously not meet such standards; if the site flames the Free
Software Foundation, or has no apparent relation to free software and
surrounding issues, the link shouldn't be made.  Beyond that, however,
there are criteria used in determining whether or not it is appropriate to
provide a link to a page from ours.  They are listed below, in order of
descending general importance.</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the context of the link?</li>
</ul>

<p>The link's purpose on our site will play a role in determining how
strongly it should be judged against the other criteria.  Pages
hosting GNU projects will be held to the highest standards.  Pages
about other free software and given high promotion&mdash;for example,
included in a GNUs Flash on the main page&mdash;are a close second.
Links on the philosophy page may be given more leeway in talking
about proprietary software; GNU/Linux user group pages should call
the system GNU/Linux almost always but are hardly checked on other
criteria.  Always keep this in mind when deciding how to weigh each
aspect of these policies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the page promote proprietary software?</li>
</ul>

<p>The big point made by the free software movement is that proprietary
software presents an ethical dilemma: you cannot agree to such
non-free terms and treat those around you as you would like to be
treated.  When proprietary software is promoted, people get the
impression that it is okay to use it, while we are trying to convince
them otherwise.  As such, we avoid offering such free advertising,
either directly on our site or indirectly through links.</p>

<p>What's tricky about this criteria is the "promotion" point: there's
a difference between mentioning proprietary software and making a
sales pitch for it.  Indeed, the GNU project web site mentions
proprietary software throughout, but never gives people the impression
that its use does not present ethical problems.</p>

<p>There are two things to keep in mind when determining whether a
reference to proprietary software promotes it, or simply mentions
it.  First, how much information does it offer about the software?
Second, how much information is the reader likely to actually gain
from this page?</p>

<p>Different pages provide different amounts of information about
proprietary software; the more it provides, the more of a problem
it poses for us.  For example, some pages may link to the primary
site for a proprietary software program.  Others may describe its
functionality in detail.  Even the product name given matters;
there's a difference between "Windows" and "Microsoft Windows XP
Home Edition."</p>

<p>If the page requires <a href="/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree, 
nontrivial JavaScript</a> and has serious failures with
JavaScript disabled, the link shouldn't be made. Similarly, if the page 
has embedded Flash that plays an important role, so that a person would 
be missing something important if the videos do not play, the link 
should not be made.</p>

<p>The subject of the reference will also play a role in determining
how problematic a reference is.  If the software is already very
popular, it's unlikely that a basic mention of it will be news to
the reader.  Some examples of proprietary software which are common
enough to be considered "well-known" are major operating systems
(Windows, Mac OS, Sun OS, HP-UX) and primary common applications
such as Office, Internet Explorer, Photoshop, Acrobat Reader, and
Flash.</p>

<p>GNU software project pages feel the full force of this policy.
Proprietary software should only be mentioned when the software
provides support for it, or to compare it against the features of
well-known proprietary software.  For example, the following
text&mdash;and not much else&mdash;would be acceptable:</p>

<p>w3 is a web browser for GNU Emacs, similar to Internet Explorer.
It can run on all platforms GNU Emacs runs on, including GNU/Linux,
proprietary Unix systems, and Windows.</p>

<p>Links which appear in other areas, such as the testimonials or
philosophy pages, as well as links to user groups may discuss such
software in greater detail, but links and other methods of
encouragement to "learn more" should still be avoided.</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the page compare free software to open source?</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all pages which have links on our site should, at the very
least, treat free software and open source equally.  Failure to do
so&mdash;whether it be by omitting free software or by implying that
open source is superior&mdash;is usually unacceptable.  GNU software
project pages should have little mention of open source.  The GNOME
page provides a good example of a way to do it tactfully:-</p>

<p>GNOME is part of the GNU project, and is free software (sometimes
referred to as open source software).</p>

<p>Any exceptions to this rule should be apparent from the context.
For instance, user groups pages may talk in greater detail about
open source; we state on the user groups page, "As with our links
page, the FSF is not responsible for the content of other web sites,
or how up-to-date their information is."</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the page treat the GNU project?</li>
</ul>

<p>Pages which we link to should treat the GNU project well.  The
primary thing to look out for in this regard is whether the page
calls the system GNU/Linux or just "Linux."  GNU software project
and user group pages should almost never, if ever, fail to do this.
Again, exceptions for other pages should be apparent from context.</p>

<p>That said, certain parts of a page should not be considered against these
criteria.  For example, suppose we were to make a link to a page on a free
software news site.  Any advertisements or reader comments attached to the
article would not be considered when determining whether it met or linking
guidelines, since they're understood to be the opinion of their individual
authors.  Similarly, on user group pages, the content of forums and Wiki
pages should not hold weight in these regards.</p>

<p>Finally, some sites are understood to always have exception with most of
these guidelines.  These sites are usually about issues which are
important, but somewhat peripheral, to the free software movement.  Several
times we have linked to the Electronic Frontier Foundation's site, even
though they encourage the use of Flash and talked exclusively about open
source software.  It's generally understood that since these pages are not
primarily about free software, the policies do not hold full force for
them.</p>

<p>As a final explanation (coming from RMS):
Even for making links from www.gnu.org, we do not *require* that
people call the system GNU/Linux or use the term "free software"
rather than "open source."  We do, however, require that they not
promote any non-free software.</p>

<p>If all this seems complicated, that's because, unfortunately, it is.  Don't
worry; a knack for it comes with time and experience.  You may mis-evaluate
a few pages as you're learning to get a feel for what's acceptable and what
isn't; please don't hesitate to get a second opinion from a more
experienced webmaster, or someone in charge like the chief webmaster or
RMS.  New exceptions will always come up; keep an open mind to that
possibility and be ready to handle them properly.</p>


<a id="distros"></a>
<h4>Links to free GNU/Linux distributions</h4>

<p>Suggestions for links to <a href="/distros/distros.html">GNU/Linux
distributions</a> should be handled like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The requestors should be the primary developers of the distro, not
just users.  If they are users, thank them and ask them to contact the
developers in case they want to be listed.</li>

<li>Briefly check that the distro is a <a
href="/distros/common-distros.html">feasible candidate</a>: they should
have a clear policy of only including free software, and it should be
reasonably apparent how to get the sources and what packages are
included.  If these things are not present, talk to the requestor about
it (politely).</li>

<li>If there are no glaring problems, ask the requestors to request an
endorsement from the (nongnu.org) gnu-linux-libre mailing list.  They
should include a description of their new distro, a link to their home
page, and any other useful info.  Our ticket should then be
resolved.</li>

<li>FYI: the gnu-linux-libre list will take over from there.  In essence,
they will review it in detail for meeting our criteria, and if all seems
good, pass it on to the FSF licensing person for final approval.</li>
</ol>

<p>In any event, webmasters should <i>never</i> simply add new distros
that are said to be free to <a href="/distros/free-distros.html">our
list</a>.  FSF licensing and rms must explicitly approve any
additions.</p>


<h4 id="usergroups">Links to GNU &amp; Free Software User Groups</h4>

<p>Requests for links to GNU or Free Software Users Groups can be referred
to the LibrePlanet website. Our ticket can then be resolved.</p>


<h3 id="mirrors">Mirrors</h3>

<p><i>ftp mirrors:</i> we have <a href="/server/mirror.html">advice for
mirrors</a> that explains what we ask mirror volunteers to provide.</p>

<p>When we get a request to add, change, or remove a mirror of
ftp.gnu.org, first ensure the mirror meets our criteria, as described on
the above page.  If in <i>any</i> doubt, check with the mailing list
and/or gnu-advisory@gnu.org before taking any action.</p>

<p>After confirming the mirror meets our criteria for listing, edit the
file prep/FTP (in CVS); it's plain text, not HTML.  Then run make in the
prep/ subdirectory.  Then cvs commit both of the files FTP and ftp.html.
Then update /gd/gnuorg/web/FTP.contacts on fencepost, following the
existing pattern.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://download.savannah.gnu.org/mirmon/gnu/">mirmon page</a> 
trackshow up-to-date each mirror is (maintained by savannah); it is good to 
write a mirror contact when it has gotten more than a week or two out of 
date. The address <tt>http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/PKG</tt> (also maintained by 
savannah) multiplexes between the mirrors, trying to choose one that is
nearby and up to date.</p>

<p><i>nongnu mirrors:</i> when we get a request to add, change, or
remove a nongnu savannah mirror, email savannah-hackers-private@gnu.org
with the information.  The reason to use -private is to avoid the
contact address from becoming public.</p>

<p><i>www mirrors:</i> we no longer recommend or list mirrors of
www.gnu.org.</p>

<p><i>Mirror contact information:</i> when we get a request relating to
a mirror, please check the file <tt>/gd/gnuorg/web/FTP.contacts</tt> on
fencepost.  and add contact information if it's not there already.  We
lack information for many older mirrors.</p>

<p><i>Ibiblio URL changes:</i> if we are told or determine that the
rsync URL for ibiblio, or the <a href="/server/mirror.html">advertised
source mirrors</a> URLs, change, all mirror maintainers should be
informed.  This requires hand-assembling a list of addresses from the
<tt>FTP.contacts</tt> file based on the current mirror list.</p>


<h3 id="commonreq">Handling common requests</h3>

<p>There are a number of requests which recur frequently.  This section
documents guidelines for handling these types of requests.</p>

<p>Those requests which are extremely straightforward&mdash;for example, fixing
typographical errors, or problems in HTML formatting&mdash;are not documented
here.  Only requests which may require non-obvious action are listed.</p>

<h4>Fixing dead links</h4>

<p>If a link has gone bad because a page has moved, try to find its
replacement.  If you are successful, re-check the page to ensure that it
meets our linking criteria, and if so, add it.  If you do not find a
replacement, remove the link&mdash;if it's central to the page, you may
need to make a note explaining that the resource is no longer available.
If the page no longer meets our linking criteria, you'll have to make a
judgment call, and weigh the value of the link against its problems';
you may want to mail the person who wrote the page with the link to get
a second opinion.</p>

<p>If you do remove a link from a page that we don't maintain&mdash;for
instance, the page for a piece of software which is kept up-to-date by
the maintainer&mdash;please notify them of the problem and what you did
to fix it.</p>

<h4>Adding links</h4>

<p>We'll sometimes be asked to add links to the page; most often, this
will come from RMS, asking us to add a page to the Other People's Views
section of the philosophy page or as part of a GNUs Flash to the front
page.</p>

<p>If the person requesting the link is a friend of the GNU project,
check the page against our linking criteria, and if it passes, add the
link as requested.  If it does not meet our linking criteria, send mail
back to the requestor, saying so and outlining in detail what the
problem(s) with it are.</p>

<p>If the suggestion is coming from someone outside the GNU project,
check the page against our linking criteria, and if it passes, forward
the suggestion to the appropriate party.  If the link would be part of
the main GNU site, that would be someone who can speak for the GNU
project, such as RMS.  If the link would be part of a software page,
direct it to the person responsible for the program's site&mdash;if no
other contact is given, that would be the maintainers themselves.  If
you're told that adding the link is acceptable, do so.  If the link
fails to meet the linking criteria, thank the original requestor for
their suggestion and explain that we don't feel the link is most
appropriate for our site.</p>

<h4>Adding new articles</h4>

<p>Occasionally, RMS will mail an article, usually in plain text, to
webmasters and ask that they put it on the site.  The text needs to be
converted to the HTML and put into our standard boilerplate; you can use
/boilerplate.html to provide a template for the header and footer, or
base your page from another article.  There are some things which you
should look out for when doing the conversion:</p>

<ul>
<li>When they exist, preserve double spaces after sentence breaks.</li>
<li>Ensure that translation links use the page's given
  name, rather than a boilerplate one.</li>
<li>Ensure that the article's title is put in both the
  &lt;title&gt; tag and in the &lt;h2&gt; text at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Put the author of the article in the page's header as well.</li>
<li>Provide a link back to the directory's main page.  If it is a
   speech or an interview, briefly state the topic.</li>
<li>New pages (and existing pages) should have a timestamp at the bottom.
   See the <a href="boilerplate.html">boilerplate</a> file for the precise
   location and format.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#announcements">Announce the page on the site.</a></p>

<a id="gnupackages"></a>
<h4>Web pages for official GNU software</h4>

<p>GNU software maintainers usually gain CVS write access to their
/software subdirectory by registering their project with Savannah.  (In
the past, they provided webmasters with pages for us to install
on the site, but that is no longer the best procedure.)</p>

<p>In general, package maintainers are responsible for their own
content, and thus webmasters should not make changes to package-specific
web pages unless we're asked to.  We do have the technical permission to
check out any GNU (or non-GNU) web repository from savannah and commit
changes, if a maintainer asks us to, or confirms a particular
change.</p>

<h4>Translations: Adding and deleting</h4>

<p>Adding: Occasionally, someone will send us a translation of a single
page.  Move these tickets to the web-translators queue.</p>

<p>Deleting: Here and there you might find a translated page which is
actually a copy of the original page (i.e., not a translation at all),
or translations which seem like they should not exist in their current
form for whatever reason.  In such a case the best thing to do is to ask
the relevant translation team for the reasons they put the page there
(please, make sure to CC web-translators@gnu.org on such cases). They
might have reasons you are not aware of. In case you do not get
<b>within two weeks</b> a satisfactory reason for the page to be left
alone, you can handle it as you see fit.</p>

<h4>Requests for permission to use an image</h4>

<p>When someone emails requesting permission to use an image from the
Art section of the site, the first thing to do is to check the web page
that the image is on. Most of the images have a clear license on the
page with them. If the permission being requested are reasonable but are
incompatible with that license, forward the ticket to the licensing
queue. Otherwise draw their attention to the license.</p>

<p>If the web page with the image on does not have a clear license and
the request is a clear-cut "yes" or "no", respond to the requestor
directly and explain the decision with reference to GNU policy.  For
more difficult cases forward to licensing.</p>

<p>When considering a request, err on the side of caution. If the use of
an image isn't something we'd link to, for example, then it isn't
something we should give permission for. Feel free to discuss any
requests with www-discuss before responding to them.</p>

<h4 id="pressreleases">Handling press releases</h4>

<p>Occasionally, the webmasters are asked to handle press releases.  These
are in the <a href="/press">/press</a> directory.  You should always make
both a text and HTML version, and follow the format used for other press
releases.  (Some do have PDF and Postscript, but webmasters need not worry
about that at the moment).</p>

<p>Currently, it is often <a href="mailto:johns@gnu.org">johns</a> who
handles the text version of a press release.  He will normally commit
the <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information
Interchange">ASCII</acronym> version, and then tell webmasters to do the
"rest" or "DTRT" (do the right thing) with it.  
Sometimes the file will be emailed to webmasters instead.  You will
also be given a date and time when the press release should be up.</p>

<p>At present, always check with johns before posting any press
releases sent in by other parties, and note that johns will always
GPG-sign his messages about press releases.</p>

<p>To handle one of these requests, here is what you should do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make an HTML version of the ASCII file, following the
    format used for other press releases.  Be sure to change the
    <code>META</code> tags for <code>Keywords</code> and
    <code>Description</code> to reflect the new press release.  Also, make
    any URLs in the press release into actual links.
</li>

<li>Make an entry at the top of the list on <a
    href="/press/press.html">/press/press.html</a> for the press
    release.</li>

<li><a href="#polnews">Add an entry to the whatsnew page.</a></li>

<li>Make the whatsnew entry a GNUs Flash (add an asterisk to the
    entry) unless the request to post the release specifically
    says <em>not</em> to put a note there.</li>

<li> A release date and time "window" will be included in the request to
    post it.  The <code>cvs commit</code> should <strong>only be
    done</strong> in that window.  If you won't be able to do it then,
    use the <code>makepatch</code> command (it's in the makepatch
    package of Debian) to send a patch back to johns, and put URGENT in
    the subject line.</li>

<li>The final step is submitting it as a story to as many news sites as
    possible (linuxtoday.com, slashdot.org, and newsforge.com should
    definitely be done).  This can be done later in the same day as
    when the release goes up, but should also be done the same day.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="repo">Working with webmaster-related repositories</h3>

<p><i>Main www repository:</i>To make an initial checkout, set the
environment variable CVS_RSH=ssh, and run</p>

<pre>
cvs -d &lt;username&gt;@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/www co www
</pre>

<p>You should end up with a directory <tt>www</tt> with the CVS checkout
of our web site.</p>

<p>CVS cheatsheet: use <tt>cvs add foo</tt> to add a file or directory.
Use <tt>cvs&nbsp;update&nbsp;-P&nbsp;foo</tt> before you commit a file,
and <tt>cvs&nbsp;commit&nbsp;foo</tt> to perform the commit.  Changes
(except to <a href="#symlinks">.symlinks files</a>) should be instantly
visible on www.gnu.org.  For further details on cvs, such as reverting
to a previous version, or see diff output of particular changes, see the
<a href="http://cvs.nongnu.org/">CVS documentation</a>.</p>


<p><i>audio-video repository:</i> Use <tt>audio-video</tt> instead of
<tt>www</tt> and you will get the repository corresponding to <a
href="http://audio-video.gnu.org">audio-video.gnu.org</a>.  Discuss
any changes to audio-video with campaigns@fsf.org.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: all materials in the current audio-video 
repository will eventually be migrated to <a
href="http://audio-video-dev.gnu.org">audio-video-dev.gnu.org</a>. To
post a file in this new website, first you need to be added as a user
with admin permissions; talk to the Chief-Webmaster for this. Then
follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Upload the file to a dedicated directory in your home in Fencepost:
<tt> rsync -avz --progress your-media-file &lt;username&gt;@fencepost.gnu.org:~/your-dedicated-dir/</tt> 
  Add also a text file named <tt>your-media-file.txt</tt> with a short 
  description, for example:</p> 
 
  <pre>
  Title: Free Software in Ethics and in Practice
  Location: Manchester, UK 
  Date: 2008
  In this ninety-minutes speech Richard Stallman talks about the goals 
  and philosophy of the Free Software movement, and the status and 
  history of the GNU operating system.
  </pre>
  
  <p>You can find descriptions of RMS' speeches in the 
  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/events/rms-speeches.html">FSF website</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li> <p>Login to your Fencepost account and, from there, copy the file 
you just uploaded onto the audio-video-dev machine under 
/var/www/audio-incoming or /var/www/video-incoming as appropriate:
<tt>rsync -avz your-video-file &lt;username&gt;@audio-video-dev:/var/www/video-incoming/</tt></p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Login to the <a
href="http://audio-video-dev.gnu.org">audio-video-dev.gnu.org</a> website.
Enter the Admin interface. Whether you want to submit a video or an audio
file, go to Videos > Submit a Video > enter URL: 
<tt>http://audio-video-dev.gnu.org/static-video/your-video-file.ogv</tt>.
Replace <tt>static-video</tt> with <tt>static-audio</tt> if you are 
submitting an audio file.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Add a thumbnail, add and edit descriptions as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Other packages:</i> Many software packages have their own projects
on Savannah and hence their own web repository corresponding to their
www/software/fooproject directory.  If the maintainer needs your help
with one of their web pages, you can get to it like this:</p>

<pre>
cvs -d &lt;username&gt;@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/fooproject co fooproject
</pre>

<p>Do not edit the web pages for software projects unless the maintainer
says ok.  At the very least, inform them if you make a change.</p>


<h4 id="scripts">Scripts</h4>

<p>A <a href="/server/source/source.html">description of scripts and
software</a> used on www.gnu.org is available.  Please read it before
writing any scripts, and also update it as needed.</p>


<h4 id="symlinks">Symbolic links</h4>

<p>Since CVS is not able to handle symbolic links directly, a separate
mechanism has been implemented to allow webmasters to maintain symbolic
links, as follows.  (Actual symbolic links are no longer created on
<tt>www.gnu.org</tt>; mod_rewrite rules are used instead.  But we'll
keep this discussion talking about symlinks since it is easier to
understand that way.)</p>

<p>Special files, named .symlinks, can be committed to the CVS tree that
are interpreted as specifications to build symbolic links.  On commit,
the current directory is searched recursively for .symlinks files.  Only
directories containing a .symlinks file are handled.</p>

<p>Each symbolic link specification from the .symlinks file is honored,
i.e., the symbolic link is created if it does not exist yet. If a
symbolic link is found in the directory and is not listed in the
.symlinks file, it is removed.</p>

<p>As a special case, if a page with the directory's name exists, and
index.html does not exist, a link will be made from index.html to the
main page.</p>

<p>The .symlinks files obey the "ln -s" format, as described below:</p>

<p>Lines starting with a sharp sign ("#") are ignored.</p>

<p>Lines that do not contain two strings separated by white space are silently
ignored.</p>

<p>Symbolic links that point outside the web site document root are
ignored.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a .symlinks file:</p>

<pre>
# Make a link named l.html to a target t.html.
# Strictly equivalent to ln -s t.html l.html:
t.html l.html
</pre>

<p>On each line the first file name must be a relative path name to an
existing file. The file designated by this path must not be outside the
document root. The second file name may not contain any slash; it is the
name of the symbolic link to be created in the present directory.</p>

<p>As a special case, if a file name ends in &ldquo;.html&rdquo;, single
line defines links to all possible translations that follow our <a
href="/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html#NamingTranslations">naming
conventions</a>. As a side effect, this makes it impossible to use
symlinks to redirect to and from HTML files whose names look like
translations, that is, <code>page.<var>LL</var>.html</code> or
<code>page.<var>LL-CC</var>.html</code>, where LL and CC are two-letter
codes.  When you need such redirections, use the <a
href="#htaccess">htaccess mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>These days, the .symlinks handling happens on <tt>www.gnu.org</tt>
via a cron job that runs twice an hour.  Webmasters do not have
access to it.</p>

<h4 id="htaccess">.htaccess and redirections</h4>

<p>To browsers, the symbolic links in the previous section are
indistinguishable from the actual file.  You may want an actual
redirection in some cases.  You can do this either in the top-level
control file <tt>.htaccess</tt>, or by using something like this as the
file to be redirected:</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;
  url=http://www.gnu.org/target"&gt;
</pre>


<h4>System administrators</h4>

<p>The system administrators for GNU change from time to time.  Please
email the sysadmin list (sysadmin@gnu.org) rather than an individual,
unless you have a specific reason to do so.</p>

<!-- If needed, change the copyright block at the bottom. In general,
     pages on the GNU web server should be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.
     Please do NOT change or remove this without talking
     with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the document.
     For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the document
     was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
