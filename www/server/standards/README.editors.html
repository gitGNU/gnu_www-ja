<h2>Guidelines for Writing Web Pages at www.gnu.org</h2>

<p>This is a general guide for everyone who wishes to write a web page for 
the GNU project web server, <code>www.gnu.org</code>. There are several 
other guides that are important, one of the most important ones is the
<a href="/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html">FSF HTML Style Sheet</a>. A
<a href="/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#readme">
list of other guides</a> is also available.</p>

<p>
No pages on the GNU project web server should ever make any references
to nonfree software or nonfree documentation. This is VERY important.
</p>

<p>
The boilerplate that is used for all our pages is in
<a href="/boilerplate.html">http://www.gnu.org/boilerplate.html</a>.
A good start when writing a web page is to use that boilerplate and follow 
the instructions in it. Please delete the unneeded comments as you go.
It makes the HTML source file easier for future maintainers to work with.
You should also check for specialized versions of boilerplate.html in the 
current directory, and those above it.
</p>

<p>
When writing a page for a certain program, we want to have some basic
information on such a page:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A description on what the program does</li>
	<li>Where to download the program in question</li>
	<li>Where to report bugs</li>
	<li>FAQs and documentation if they are available</li>
	<li>Installation instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>
The description should be long enough so that people can grasp the whole
program, but not so long that they get bored by reading it. If a package
consists of several smaller programs, it is best to write a general 
description of what types of programs belong in the package and then write 
shorter descriptions for each program.
</p>

<p>
The GNU Project would like to host all web pages about a program, so if
the main pages are currently on some other server, please consider moving
them to the GNU project web server instead.

<!-- Regarding copyright, in general, standalone pages (as opposed to
     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
