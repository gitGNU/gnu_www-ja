<!-- When using this boilerplate, remember to replace the "???" in both places above. -->

<!-- when you replace this graphics, make sure you change the link
     to also point to the correct html page.
     If you make a new graphics for this page, make sure it has
     a corresponding entry in /graphics/graphics.html                     -->

<P>

This is a general guide for everyone who wishes to write a web page
for the GNU project web server, <CODE>www.gnu.org</CODE>.
There are several other guides that
are important, one of the most important ones is the
<a href="/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html">FSF HTML Style Sheet</a> in
http://www.gnu.org/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html.
A list of the others are in
<A HREF="/server/standards/readme_index.html">http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/readme_index.html</A>.
<P>
No pages on the GNU project web server should ever make any references
to non-free software or non-free documentation. This is VERY important.
<P>

The boilerplate that is used for all our pages in is
<a href="/boilerplate.html">http://www.gnu.org/boilerplate.html</a>.
A good start when writing a web page
is to use that boilerplate and follow the instructions in it.
Please delete the unneeded comments as you go.
It makes the HTML source file easier for later maintainers to work with.
You should also check for specialized versions of
boilerplate.html in the current directory,
and those above it.

<P>
When writing a page for a certain program, we want to have some basic
information on such a page:
<ul>
	<li>A description on what the program does
	<LI>Where to download the program in question
	<LI>Where to report bugs
	<LI>FAQs and documentation if they are available
	<LI>Installation instructions
</ul>
<P>
The description should be long enough so that people can grasp the whole
program, but not so long that they get bored by reading it. If a package
consists of several smaller programs, it is best to write a general description
of what type of programs that belong in the package and then write shorter
descriptions for each program.
<P>
The GNU Project would like to host all web pages about a program, so if
the main pages is currently on some other server, please consider moving
them to the GNU project web server instead.
