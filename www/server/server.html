<h2>About GNU Servers</h2>

<p>We have <a href="/server/irc-rules.html">rules for official GNU and FSF IRC
channels</a>.</p>

<p>We have <a href="/server/mirror.html">information and advice for those
wishing to mirror ftp.gnu.org</a>.  (We no longer suggest mirroring
www.gnu.org.)</p>

<p>For designing and authoring our web pages, we follow certain <a
href="/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html">style guidelines</a>.  If you
would like to help, we have a list of <a
href="/server/tasks.html">tasks</a> that need to be done on this web
site.  All our pages are <a
href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/">Best Viewed with Any
Browser</a>.</p>

<p>Just as we do not install proprietary software, we have a policy of
not making links to pages that promote proprietary programs.  We
cannot make proprietary software disappear by not talking about it;
information about proprietary software is widely available, and people
who want it will get it somehow.  But we prefer not to be participants
in the process of advertising proprietary software.</p>

<p>We also confine all links to text that is commercial in its tone to a
few of our pages, where the topic makes such links appropriate.  This
is so we can avoid appearing to share the widespread assumption that
money and business are the highest value in life.</p>

<p>Only <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> is used on
this computer.  The web server is the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache web server</a>,
which is distributed under the Apache license (a free software license).
To support this server,
we also use other free software developed by GNU volunteers
and we maintain a <a href="/server/source/source.html">list of such
software</a>.</p>

<p>We currently host through Global NAP, who have graciously donated the
bandwidth and colocation space for this system.</p>

<p>The operating system is Trisquel GNU/Linux, which is one example of a
<a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> system. Trisquel GNU/Linux 
is listed on <a href="/distros/free-distros.html">our list of free 
GNU/Linux-distributions</a>.</p>
