<h2>Free Software for Education</h2>

<p>Here are two lists of high-quality free/libre software applications that 
can be used in schools and educational institutions of all levels. The 
first one is a list of free/libre programs along with the popular 
proprietary applications they replace. The second one contains free/libre 
programs that do not necessarily replace a proprietary counterpart but can 
be very useful to students and teachers.</p>

<p>All these programs are released under a license that is granted 
for zero price and does not expire. While we are glad that schools can also 
save money with these programs, avoiding miseducation (teaching dependence 
on nonfree software) is a more important imperative: when we say these 
programs are <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, 
<strong>we are talking about freedom, not price</strong>. It means that 
you are free to use them constructively, either alone or in a community, 
while respecting the freedom of others.</p>

<p>Everyone should use free software, because only free software gives
users the freedom to control their own computers. However, there are
<a href="/education/edu-schools.html">other reasons</a> that apply
specifically to education.</p>

<p>In addition to the wrong of nonfree software, the use of third-party
network services in schools poses yet another problem: <a 
href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/google-deceptively-tracks-students-internet-browsing-eff-says-complaint-federal-trade">
the collection of students (and teachers) personal data by companies</a>.</p>

<p>But even if the school never used those services, it could not be sure
that the machines are not sending data. In fact, the source code of
proprietary programs is secret, so users don't know what the software is
really doing.</p>
