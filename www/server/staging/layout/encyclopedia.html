<h2>The Free Encyclopedia Project</h2>

<p>Our idea for a free encyclopedia is described
in <a href="/encyclopedia/free-encyclopedia.html">The Free Universal
Encyclopedia and Learning Resource</a>.</p>

<p>Just as we were starting a project, GNUpedia, to develop a free
encyclopedia, the <em>Nupedia</em> encyclopedia project adopted
the <a href="/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
and thus became a free commercial project.  So we decided to merge
GNUpedia project into Nupedia.  Now,
the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> encyclopedia
project has adopted the philosophy of Nupedia and taken it even
further.  We encourage you to visit and contribute to the site.</p>

<!-- Regarding copyright, in general, standalone pages (as opposed to
     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 4.0.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
