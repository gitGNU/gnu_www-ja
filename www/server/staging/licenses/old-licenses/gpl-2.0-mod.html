Programs</a></h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><var>one line to give the program’s name and an idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<pre>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type ‘show w’.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ 
for details.</pre>

<p>The hypothetical commands <samp>‘show w’</samp> and <samp>‘show
c’</samp> should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of
course, the commands you use may be called something other than <samp>‘show
w’</samp> and <samp>‘show c’</samp>; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<pre>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program ‘Gnomovision’
(which makes passes at compilers) written 
by James Hacker.

<var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice</pre>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the <a href="/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser
General Public License</a> instead of this License.</p>
