<h3><a id="SEC4" href="#TOC4">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</a></h3>

<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).</p>

<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre><var>one line to give the library’s name and an idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>year</var>  <var>name of author</var>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<pre>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library ‘Frob’ (a library for tweaking knobs) written
by James Random Hacker.

<var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1990
