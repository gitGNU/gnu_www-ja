<h2>Dog Cartoon</h2>

<div class="pict wide">
<img src="dog.small.jpg" alt=" [Dog, wondering at pop-up ads] " />
</div>

<p>A cute beagle is sitting by his computer, which shows pop-up ads for
a yummy bone, a dog toy, and a comfortable-looking doggy bed. These ads
are partially covering the text of an article by Richard Stallman, <a
href="/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy">How Much Surveillance Can
Democracy Withstand?</a> (only visible in the large picture). The dog is
wondering, <em>&ldquo;How did they find out I'm a dog?&rdquo;</em></p>
