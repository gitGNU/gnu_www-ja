Test 8 - Summary of changes (updated January 7, 2014)


1. Main changes (layout.css, home.html, home.fr.html, philosophy.fr.html, edu-schools.fr.html, edu-cases-india-ambedkar.html)

* Use the "inner" div for the whole page.
* Convert px to em or % so that different default font sizes will give the same layout.
* Change .8em or "small" to .9em/.95em for readability.
* Use HTML text for the GNU banner.
* Clearly separate the top links and translations from the GNU banner.
* Move the fundraiser above the GNU banner.
* Move the fss and join-fsf box to the footer-text section, and add a top link "About FSF".
* Make a more visible join-fsf button and clearer fssbox.
* Make the mission-statement easier to read by dividing it into paragraphs and placing 'Free Software Foundation' within <strong> tags.
* Place the sentence about sister organizations after the mission-statement and join-fsf button.
* Float "backtotop" to the right.
* Keep the navbars + breadcrumbs together, separate from h2; keep the whole thing as unobtrusive as possible.
* Shorten the translation disclaimer and turn it into a floated button, in line with the edu-navbar.
* Add a div id for "transnotes" (set the font size to .9em instead of "small").
* Add a "back" id for the edu-cases bottom links ("More Case Studies in India" and "Back to Case Studies"), and float them to the right. They are similar to "backtotop". We could use a single class for all the "back" links.
* Add an id for the "bottom-notes" and float them to the right.
* Add a div class for the "footer-units" (general inquiries, translation inquiries, copyright/license and translator's credits) to individualize them as paragraphs.
* Remove 3 items from the "Take Action" list on the home page, to balance the heights of the left and right columns. They can go to takeaction.html.
* Use a different version of the same screenshot image (sharper at higher zooms).
* Change the style of the "Download GNU" button.
* Keep the number of colors to a minimum: red and blue from GNU banner (or similar colors) + different shades of gray, yellow occasionally (the listings and the table in gpl-faq haven't been touched).
* Use a color gradient as a background for the browser window.
* Rearrange layout.css with sections, uniformize tab size, etc.

This affects:

* layout.css
* banner.html
* body-include-1.html
* body-include-2.html
* footer-text.html
* translation notes and footer div
* bottom-notes.html
* education files (move edu-navbar and breadcrumbs, add "back" id)
* philosophy.html, essays-and-articles.html, speeches-and-interviews.html, third-party-ideas.html (move edu-navbar)
* possibly any file which has bottom links similar to "Back to Case Studies"
* t-desktop-4-small.jpg -> medium
* home.html (translations might get fuzzy because of the different image)


2. Alternate version of the home page (layout1.css, home1.html, home1.fr.html)

* Uniformize the size of columns, removing references to combo.css.
* Center "Take Action" and add vertical borders on both sides.
* Remove <small> in the blurbs (definitely too small).

This affects:

* layout.css
* home.html
* home-pkgblurbs and its translations.
