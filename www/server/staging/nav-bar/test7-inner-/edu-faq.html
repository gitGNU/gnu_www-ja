<h2>Educational Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
</div> <!-- id="edu-content" -->
	
<p class="edu-breadcrumb"><a href="education.html">Education</a> &rarr; 
FAQ</p>
		
<p>Many Free Software advocates encounter difficulties when talking to 
the administrators of educational institutions about the advantages of 
using and teaching Free Software. Often school administrators have never 
heard of Free Software or have heard only about Open Source, so they 
raise many doubts. Here we put together some of the most common 
questions and the best possible answers to eliminate uncertainties.</p>

<dl>
		 <dt>As a teacher, I've been trying hard to explain to the 
			school's administrators the advantages that Open Source software can 
			bring to our school, but they don't  seem to be interested.</dt>
			
			<dd>
				<p>Open Source refers only to the technical advantages of software. 
				Schools may not be interested in that aspect since most probably 
				technical requirements are already satisfied by the proprietary 
				software in use. You need to talk to them in terms of Free Libre 
		  Software, not Open Source, so that you can explain to them the 
		  philosophical and ethical reasons why educational institutions 
		  should reject proprietary software.</p>
				<p>See the <a href="/education/edu-why.html">Reasons 
				Why</a> educational institutions should use and teach 
				exclusively Free Software.</p>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>I would love to see all schools migrate to Free Software, but I 
			think it's hopeless. Proprietary software companies have too much 
			power, even over schools. The situation is discouraging.</dt>
			
			<dd>
				<p>While it is true that proprietary software corporations have
				managed to impose their products on society by using schools as
				propaganda agents, it is also true that many schools around the
				world have adopted Free Software with excellent results.  See our
				<a href="/education/edu-cases.html">Case Studies</a> section 
				for some examples.</p>
				
				<p>When we started the GNU Project back in 1983, the situation was 
				very discouraging for us too. We started from zero, and today 
				millions of people around the world use Free Libre Software.</p>		
			</dd>
			
			<dt>I am the head of a technical institute and I would like to teach 
			our students the use and administration of a Free Libre platform, but 
			I have to comply with the curriculum established by the Ministry of 
			Education, which requires the teaching of proprietary platforms and 
			programs.</dt>
			
			<dd>
    <p>If you are literally forced to teach nonfree software, you should
    tell the students that you consider this software unethical, that 
    you are doing this only because you are being forced, and that you 
    will do as little of it as possible so that you can move on to 
    freedom-respecting software.</p>				

    <p>We must not forget that schools have a great influence on 
				society, so making our students aware of the advantages of Free 
				Software is a way of putting pressure on decision makers. You can 
    start by telling your students about Free Software and its ethical 
    values, as they might never have heard of it. With your endorsement 
    and support, this may lead to the formation of a Free Software Group 
    in your school. Then the group can make its voice heard by writing 
    letters to the Ministry, holding events to promote Free Software, 
    and other similar activities.</p>
				
				<p>When computer users will start demanding their rights, 
    Governments will have to issue their laws accordingly. That is why 
    political and social awareness are fundamental aspects which cannot 
    be left aside when talking about Free Software.</p>
