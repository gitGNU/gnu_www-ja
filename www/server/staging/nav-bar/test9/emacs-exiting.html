<dt><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd><dd>Kill Emacs (<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-z</kbd><dd>On a text terminal, suspend Emacs; on a graphical display,
&ldquo;minimize&rdquo; the selected frame (<code>suspend-emacs</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dc-52"></a><a name="index-save_002dbuffers_002dkill_002dterminal-53"></a>  <dfn>Killing</dfn> Emacs means terminating the Emacs program.  To do
this, type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> (<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code>).  A
two-character key sequence is used to make it harder to type by
accident.  If there are any modified file-visiting buffers when you
type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, Emacs first offers to save these buffers.  If you
do not save them all, it asks for confirmation again, since the
unsaved changes will be lost.  Emacs also asks for confirmation if any
subprocesses are still running, since killing Emacs will also kill the
subprocesses (see <a href="Shell.html#Shell">Shell</a>).

   <p><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> behaves specially if you are using Emacs as a server. 
If you type it from a &ldquo;client frame&rdquo;, it closes the client
connection.  See <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

   <p>Emacs can, optionally, record certain session information when you
kill it, such as the files you were visiting at the time.  This
information is then available the next time you start Emacs. 
See <a href="Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions">Saving Emacs Sessions</a>.

   <p><a name="index-confirm_002dkill_002demacs-54"></a>  If the value of the variable <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> assumes that its value is a predicate
function, and calls that function.  If the result of the function call
is non-<code>nil</code>, the session is killed, otherwise Emacs continues to
run.  One convenient function to use as the value of
<code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is the function <code>yes-or-no-p</code>.  The
default value of <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002demacs-55"></a>  To kill Emacs without being prompted about saving, type <kbd>M-x
kill-emacs</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dz-56"></a><a name="index-suspend_002dframe-57"></a><a name="index-minimizing-58"></a><a name="index-iconifying-59"></a><a name="index-suspending-60"></a>  <kbd>C-z</kbd> runs the command <code>suspend-frame</code>.  On a graphical
display, this command <dfn>minimizes</dfn> (or <dfn>iconifies</dfn>) the
selected Emacs frame, hiding it in a way that lets you bring it back
later (exactly how this hiding occurs depends on the window system). 
On a text terminal, the <kbd>C-z</kbd> command <dfn>suspends</dfn> Emacs,
stopping the program temporarily and returning control to the parent
process (usually a shell); in most shells, you can resume Emacs after
suspending it with the shell command <samp><span class="command">%emacs</span></samp>.

   <p>Text terminals usually listen for certain special characters whose
meaning is to kill or suspend the program you are running.  <b>This
terminal feature is turned off while you are in Emacs.</b>  The meanings
of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> as keys in Emacs were inspired by the
use of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> on several operating systems as the
characters for stopping or killing a program, but that is their only
relationship with the operating system.  You can customize these keys
to run any commands of your choice (see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).
