<h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>

<p>You are reading about GNU Emacs, the GNU incarnation of the
advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible editor Emacs. 
(The `G' in `GNU' is not silent.)

   <p>We call Emacs <dfn>advanced</dfn> because it can do much more than simple
insertion and deletion of text.  It can control subprocesses, indent
programs automatically, show multiple files at once, and more. 
Emacs editing commands operate in terms of characters, words, lines,
sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as expressions and comments
in various programming languages.

   <p><dfn>Self-documenting</dfn> means that at any time you can use special
commands, known as <dfn>help commands</dfn>, to find out what your options
are, or to find out what any command does, or to find all the
commands that pertain to a given topic.  See <a href="Help.html#Help">Help</a>.

   <p><dfn>Customizable</dfn> means that you can easily alter the behavior of
Emacs commands in simple ways.  For instance, if you use a programming
language in which comments start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;**</span></samp>&rsquo; and end with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">**&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, you can tell the Emacs comment manipulation commands to
use those strings (see <a href="Comments.html#Comments">Comments</a>).  To take another example, you
can rebind the basic cursor motion commands (up, down, left and right)
to any keys on the keyboard that you find comfortable. 
See <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>.

   <p><dfn>Extensible</dfn> means that you can go beyond simple customization
and create entirely new commands.  New commands are simply programs
written in the Lisp language, which are run by Emacs's own Lisp
interpreter.  Existing commands can even be redefined in the middle of
an editing session, without having to restart Emacs.  Most of the
editing commands in Emacs are written in Lisp; the few exceptions
could have been written in Lisp but use C instead for efficiency. 
Writing an extension is programming, but non-programmers can use it
afterwards.  See <a href="../eintr/index.html#Top">Emacs Lisp Intro</a>, if you want to learn Emacs
Lisp programming.
