<h2>Web Server Utility Sources</h2>

<p>(This page needs updating.  Please update it.)</p>


<p>To maintain the GNU project web server, we use a lot of different free
software. Most of them are already available on the Internet, but we also
have some software which has been developed by GNU volunteers and has
never been released as GNU software, because they are somewhat specific to
our needs.  Still, we feel that those programs should also be made
available so that others can make use of them.  This page is a list of
such programs.</p>


<h3><a id="cvs">CVS Tree</a></h3>

<p>We recommend storing the scripts in the usual www
CVS tree. This allows easier sharing between GNU machines that maintain
a full or partial image of the www.gnu.org web.  See the 
<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=www">Savannah CVS page</a>,
the &ldquo;Webpages repository&rdquo; information.</p>


<h3><a id="diffmon">diffmon</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/diffmon">Source code (15kbyte)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/server/source/diffmon.cf">Example configuration file</a></li>
  <li>Author: Noah Friedman</li>
  <li>Current version: 1.19</li>
</ul>

<p>This is another shell script with the purpose of making diff's of files
when they change and to send an email informing about the change to  a list
of recipients.  This script is used to keep administrators aware of
changes to the configuration of the webserver and other servers. It is also
used to inform editors of translations of GNU web pages into other languages
about changes to the original English document.</p>


<h3><a id="linc">linc</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/server/source/linc/?root=www">Source code</a></li>
  <li>Author: <a href="mailto:wwj@gnu.org">Wac&#322;aw Jacek</a></li>
</ul>

<p>LINC stands for &ldquo;LINC Is Not Checklink&rdquo;.  It scans our
web site (or any site) and makes a report of <a
href="linc/linc-report.html">broken links on our web site</a>.  It runs
on Wednesdays on fencepost from user gnun's cron.</p>


<h3><a id="planetrss">planetrss.pl</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/server/source/planetrss/?root=www">Source code</a></li>
  <li>Author: <a href="mailto:shailesh@gnu.org">Shailesh Ghadge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This Perl script fetches and saves N feeds from <a
href="http://planet.gnu.org.">planet.gnu.org</a>, using the RSS feed
http://planet.gnu.org/rss20.xml, in html format.  It is then included
in the homepage.  Each feed is truncated to M characters.</p>


<h3><a id="sitemap-generator">sitemap-generator</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/server/source/sitemap-generator/?root=www">Source code</a></li>
  <li>Author: <a href="mailto:wwj@gnu.org">Wac&#322;aw Jacek</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This program generates the <a href="/server/sitemap.html">sitemap of
our web site</a>, based on its directory structure on the file
system. It runs on Wednesdays on fencepost from user gnun's cron.</p>


<h3><a id="symlinks">symlinks</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/www/www/symlinks/">Source code</a></li>
  <li>Author: <a href="mailto:loic@gnu.org">Loic Dachary</a></li>
  <li>Current version: 1.1</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to cope with the inability of CVS to deal
with symbolic files. By adding special files (".symlinks") into
the CVS tree that are interpreted as specficiations to build
symbolic links.  The "symlinks" script used to be run immediately
after a "cvs update" to fix the symbolic links according to the
specifications included in the ".symlinks" files.</p>

<p>This script is no longer used on the live web site.  Instead, the
<tt>.symlinks</tt> files are transformed into RewriteRule directives.
More information about <tt>.symlinks</tt> files can be found in the <a
href="/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#symlinks">Symbolic
Links</a> section of the GNU Webmaster Guidelines.</p>


<h3><a id="update-license">update-license.php</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/server/source/update-license.php.txt">Source code</a></li>
  <li>Author: <a href="mailto:jturner@gnu.org">James Turner</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This script can be ran from the webroot to traverse through english html
files replacing the old "Verbatim coping" text with the new CC license.</p>


<h3><a id="webref">webref</a></h3>

<ul>
  <!-- <li><a href="/server/source/webref.el">Source code</a> -->
  <li>Author: Tim Bedding</li>
  <li>Current version: 1.0</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a program made in Emacs LISP that is used to check references
in HTML documents. It takes the file input.txt as input which contains
a list of HTML documents and outputs te file output.txt. The output
file contains information of documents which can not be reached at all
and documents which can only be reached by following more than two links.
We use this to make sure that all important documents can be reached
fairly easy from the main page.</p>

     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
