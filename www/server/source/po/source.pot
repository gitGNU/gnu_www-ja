"To maintain the GNU project web server, we use a lot of different free "
"software. Most of them are already available on the Internet, but we also "
"have some software which has been developed by GNU volunteers and has never "
"been released as GNU software, because they are somewhat specific to our "
"needs.  Still, we feel that those programs should also be made available so "
"that others can make use of them.  This page is a list of such programs."
