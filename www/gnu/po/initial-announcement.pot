"This is the original announcement of the GNU Project, posted by <a "

"1983."

"The actual history of the GNU Project differs in many ways from this initial "
"plan. For example, the beginning was delayed until January 1984. Several of "
"the philosophical concepts of <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free "
"software</a> were not clarified until a few years later."

"Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible "
"software system called GNU (for Gnu's Not Unix), and give it away free<a "
"href=\"#f1\">(1)</a> to everyone who can use it.  Contributions of time, "
"money, programs and equipment are greatly needed."

"To begin with, GNU will be a kernel plus all the utilities needed to write "
"and run C programs: editor, shell, C compiler, linker, assembler, and a few "
"other things.  After this we will add a text formatter, a YACC, an Empire "
"game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other things.  We hope to supply, "
"eventually, everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and "
"anything else useful, including on-line and hardcopy documentation."

"GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix.  "
"We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience "
"with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have longer "
"filenames, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, filename "
"completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and eventually a "
"Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp programs and ordinary "
"Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp will be available as "
"system programming languages.  We will have network software based on MIT's "
"chaosnet protocol, far superior to UUCP.  We may also have something "
"compatible with UUCP."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"I am Richard Stallman, inventor of the original much-imitated EMACS editor, "
"now at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.  I have worked extensively on "
"compilers, editors, debuggers, command interpreters, the Incompatible "
"Timesharing System and the Lisp Machine operating system.  I pioneered "
"terminal-independent display support in ITS.  In addition I have implemented "
"one crashproof file system and two window systems for Lisp machines."

msgid ""
"I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must "
"share it with other people who like it.  I cannot in good conscience sign a "
"nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement."

"So that I can continue to use computers without violating my principles, I "

"I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines and money.  I'm "

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One computer manufacturer has already offered to provide a machine.  But we "
"could use more.  One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is "
"that GNU will run on them at an early date.  The machine had better be able "
"to operate in a residential area, and not require sophisticated cooling or "
"power."

msgid ""
"Individual programmers can contribute by writing a compatible duplicate of "
"some Unix utility and giving it to me.  For most projects, such part-time "
"distributed work would be very hard to coordinate; the independently-written "
"parts would not work together.  But for the particular task of replacing "
"Unix, this problem is absent.  Most interface specifications are fixed by "
"Unix compatibility.  If each contribution works with the rest of Unix, it "
"will probably work with the rest of GNU."

"If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full or part "
"time.  The salary won't be high, but I'm looking for people for whom knowing "
"they are helping humanity is as important as money.  I view this as a way of "
"enabling dedicated people to devote their full energies to working on GNU by "
"sparing them the need to make a living in another way."
