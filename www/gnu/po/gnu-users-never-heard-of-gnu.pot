"Most people have never heard of GNU.  Even most of the people who use the "
"GNU system have never heard of GNU, thanks to so many people and companies "
"who teach them to call it &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.  Nonetheless, the name GNU "
"has certain associations, which people will discover once they hear the "
"name.  GNU is associated with the ideals of freedom of the free software "
"movement.  That association is no accident; the motive for developing GNU "
"was specifically to make it possible to use a computer and have freedom."

"The association between the name GNU and our goals of freedom and social "
"solidarity exists in the minds of hundreds of thousands of GNU/Linux users "
"that do know about GNU.  It exists in Wikipedia.  And it exists around the "
"web; if these users search for GNU, they will find <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org\">www.gnu.org</a>, which talks about free software "
"and freedom."

"A person seeing the name &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; for the first time in "
"&ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; won't immediately associate it with anything.  "
"However, when people know that the system is basically GNU, that brings them "
"a step closer to learning about our ideals.  For instance, they might become "
"curious and look for more information about GNU."

"If they don't look for it, they may encounter it anyway.  The &ldquo;open "
"source&rdquo; rhetoric tends to lead people's attention away from issues of "
"users' freedom, but not totally; there is still discussion of GNU and free "
"software, and people have some chance of coming across it.  When that "
"happens, the reader is more likely to pay attention to information about GNU "
"(such as that it's the work of a campaign for freedom and community) if he "
"knows he is a user of the GNU system."

"Over time, calling the system &ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; spreads awareness of "
"the ideals of freedom for which we developed the GNU system.  It is also "
"useful as a reminder for people in our community who know about these "
"ideals, in a world where much of discussion of free software takes a totally "
"practical (and thus amoral) approach.  When we ask you to call the system "
"&ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo;, we do so because awareness of GNU slowly but surely "
"brings with it awareness of the free software ideals of freedom and "
"community."
