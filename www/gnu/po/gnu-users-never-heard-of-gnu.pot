"Most people have never heard of GNU.  Even most of the people who use the "
"GNU system have never heard of GNU, since so many people and companies teach "
"them to call it &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.  Indeed, GNU users often say they are "
"&ldquo;running Linux&rdquo;, which is like saying you are &ldquo;driving "
"your carburettor&rdquo; or &ldquo;driving your transmission&rdquo;."

"Nonetheless, those who know about GNU associate it with the ideals of "
"freedom of the free software movement.  That association is no accident; the "
"motive for developing GNU was specifically to make it possible to use a "
"computer and have freedom."

"A person seeing the name &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; for the first time in "
"&ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; won't immediately know what it represents, has come "
"one step closer to finding out.  The association between the name GNU and "
"our goals of freedom and social solidarity exists in the minds of hundreds "
"of thousands of GNU/Linux users that do know about GNU.  It exists in <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org\">gnu.org</a> and in Wikipedia.  It exists around "
"the web; if these users search for GNU, they will find the ideas GNU stands "
"for."

"If they don't search, they may encounter them anyway.  The <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html\">&ldquo;open "
"source&rdquo;</a> rhetoric tends to lead people's attention away from issues "
"of users' freedom, but not totally; there is still discussion of GNU and "
"free software, and people have some chance of coming across it.  When that "
"happens, they are more likely to pay attention to information about GNU "
"(such as that it's the work of a campaign for freedom and community) if they "
"know they are users of the GNU system."

"Over time, calling the system &ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; spreads awareness of "
"the ideals of freedom for which we developed the GNU system.  It is also "
"useful as a reminder for people in our community who know about these "
"ideals, in a world where much of discussion of free software takes a totally "
"practical (and thus amoral) approach.  When we ask you to call the system "
"&ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo;, we are asking you to help in making the public "
"aware of the free software ideals."
