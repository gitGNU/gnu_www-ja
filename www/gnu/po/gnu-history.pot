"The GNU operating system is a complete free software system, "
"upward-compatible with Unix.  GNU stands for &ldquo;GNU's Not Unix&rdquo;.  "
"<a href=\"http://www.stallman.org/\">Richard Stallman</a> made the <a "
"href=\"/gnu/initial-announcement.html\">Initial Announcement</a> of the GNU "
"Project in September 1983.  A longer version called the <a "
"href=\"/gnu/manifesto.html\">GNU Manifesto</a> was published in March 1985.  "
"It has been translated into several <a "
"href=\"/gnu/manifesto.html#translations\">other languages</a>."

"The name &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; was chosen because it met a few requirements; "
"first, it was a recursive acronym for &ldquo;GNU's Not Unix&rdquo;, second, "
"because it was a real word, and third, it was fun to say (or <a "

"The word &ldquo;free&rdquo; in &ldquo;free software&rdquo; pertains to <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">freedom</a>, not price.  You may or may "
"not pay a price to get GNU software.  Either way, once you have the software "
"you have four specific freedoms in using it.  The freedom to run the program "
"as you wish; the freedom to copy the program and give it away to your "
"friends and co-workers; the freedom to change the program as you wish, by "
"having full access to source code; the freedom to distribute an improved "
"version and thus help build the community.  (If you redistribute GNU "
"software, you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, "
"or you may give away copies.)"

"The project to develop the GNU system is called the &ldquo;GNU "
"Project&rdquo;.  The GNU Project was conceived in 1983 as a way of bringing "
"back the cooperative spirit that prevailed in the computing community in "
"earlier days&mdash;to make cooperation possible once again by removing the "
"obstacles to cooperation imposed by the owners of proprietary software."

"In 1971, when Richard Stallman started his career at MIT, he worked in a "
"group which used <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a> "
"exclusively.  Even computer companies often distributed free software.  "
"Programmers were free to cooperate with each other, and often did."

"By the 1980s, almost all software was <a "

"which means that it had owners who forbid and prevent cooperation by users.  "
"This made the GNU Project necessary."

"Every computer user needs an operating system; if there is no free operating "
"system, then you can't even get started using a computer without resorting "
"to proprietary software.  So the first item on the free software agenda "
"obviously had to be a free operating system."

"We decided to make the operating system compatible with Unix because the "
"overall design was already proven and portable, and because compatibility "

"A Unix-like operating system includes a kernel, compilers, editors, text "
"formatters, mail software, graphical interfaces, libraries, games and many "
"other things.  Thus, writing a whole operating system is a very large job.  "
"We started in January 1984.  The <a href=\"http://fsf.org/\"> Free Software "
"Foundation</a> was founded in October 1985, initially to raise funds to help "
"develop GNU."

"By 1990 we had either found or written all the major components except "
"one&mdash;the kernel.  Then Linux, a Unix-like kernel, was developed by "
"Linus Torvalds in 1991 and made free software in 1992.  Combining Linux with "
"the almost-complete GNU system resulted in a complete operating system: the "
"GNU/Linux system.  Estimates are that tens of millions of people now use "
"GNU/Linux systems, typically via <a href=\"/distros\">GNU/Linux "
"distributions</a>.  The principal version of Linux now contains non-free "
"firmware &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;; free software activists now maintain a "
"modified free version of Linux, called <a "

"However, the GNU Project is not limited to the core operating system.  We "

"How far can free software go? There are no limits, except when <a "
