"There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a "

"that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.  "
"The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by "
"itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.  "
"Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the "
"whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.  All the "
"so-called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; distributions are really distributions of "

"Many users do not understand the difference between the kernel, which is "

"Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel.  But since they have "
"generally heard the whole system called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; as well, they "
"often envisage a history that would justify naming the whole system after "
"the kernel.  For example, many believe that once Linus Torvalds finished "
"writing Linux, the kernel, its users looked around for other free software "
"to go with it, and found that (for no particular reason)  most everything "
"necessary to make a Unix-like system was already available."

"What they found was no accident&mdash;it was the not-quite-complete GNU "
"system.  The available <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free "
"software</a> added up to a complete system because the GNU Project had been "
"working since 1984 to make one.  In the <a href=\"/gnu/manifesto.html\"> The "
"GNU Manifesto</a> we set forth the goal of developing a free Unix-like "
"system, called GNU.  The <a href=\"/gnu/initial-announcement.html\"> Initial "

"Most free software projects have the goal of developing a particular program "

"Unix-like kernel (Linux); Donald Knuth set out to write a text formatter "
"(TeX); Bob Scheifler set out to develop a window system (the X Window "
"System). It's natural to measure the contribution of this kind of project by "
"specific programs that came from the project."

"If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way, what "
"would we conclude? One CD-ROM vendor found that in their &ldquo;Linux "
"distribution&rdquo;, <a href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#GNUsoftware\">GNU "
"software</a> was the largest single contingent, around 28% of the total "
"source code, and this included some of the essential major components "
"without which there could be no system.  Linux itself was about 3%.  (The "
"proportions in 2008 are similar: in the &ldquo;main&rdquo; repository of "
"gNewSense, Linux is 1.5% and GNU packages are 15%.)  So if you were going to "
"pick a name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, "
"the most appropriate single choice would be &ldquo;GNU&rdquo;."

"But that is not the deepest way to consider the question.  The GNU Project "

"although we did that.  It was not a project to develop a text editor, "

"Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the "
"system, and they all deserve credit for their software.  But the reason it "
"is <em>an integrated system</em>&mdash;and not just a collection of useful "
"programs&mdash;is because the GNU Project set out to make it one.  We made a "
"list of the programs needed to make a <em>complete</em> free system, and we "
"systematically found, wrote, or found people to write everything on the "
"list.  We wrote essential but unexciting <a href=\"#unexciting\">(1)</a> "
"components because you can't have a system without them.  Some of our system "
"components, the programming tools, became popular on their own among "
"programmers, but we wrote many components that are not tools <a "

"By the early 90s we had put together the whole system aside from the "

"Developing this kernel has been a lot harder than we expected; <a "

"Making them work well together was not a trivial job.  Some GNU components<a "

"&ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; was a big job, too.  It required addressing the "
"issue of how to install and boot the system&mdash;a problem we had not "
"tackled, because we hadn't yet reached that point.  Thus, the people who "
"developed the various system distributions did a lot of essential work.  But "

"Addendum: Aside from GNU, one other project has independently produced a "

"the early 90s.  A free operating system that exists today<a "

"People sometimes ask whether BSD too is a version of GNU, like GNU/Linux.  "
"The BSD developers were inspired to make their code free software by the "

"persuade them, but the code had little overlap with GNU.  BSD systems today "
"use some GNU programs, just as the GNU system and its variants use some BSD "
"programs; however, taken as wholes, they are two different systems that "
"evolved separately.  The BSD developers did not write a kernel and add it to "
"the GNU system, and a name like GNU/BSD would not fit the situation.<a "
