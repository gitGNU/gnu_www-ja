"Richard Stallman wrote this text, which was found in a file dated May 1983, "
"though it is not clear whether it was written then or earlier.  In May 1983 "
"he was privately considering plans to develop a free operating system, but "
"he may not yet have decided to make it a Unix-like system rather than "
"something like the MIT Lisp Machine."

"He had not yet conceptually distinguished the two meanings of "
"&ldquo;free;&rdquo; this message is formulated in terms of gratis copies, "

"Five years ago one could take for granted that any useful program written at "
"SAIL, MIT, CMU, etc. would be shared.  Since then, these universities have "
"started acting just like software houses&mdash;everything useful will be "
"sold for an arm and a leg (usually after being written at gov't expense)."

"People find all sorts of excuses why it's harmful to give away software.  "
"These supposed problems never bothered us back when we <em>wanted</em> to "
"share, and haven't affected EMACS, so I suspect they are bogus."

"For example, people say that companies will &ldquo;steal&rdquo; it and sell "
"it.  If so, that would be no worse than Stanford selling it! At least people "
"would have the choice of getting a free copy.  Users want to buy maintained "
"software? Then let people sell service contracts&mdash;but give the software "
"itself free."

"Sharing software is the form that scientific cooperation takes in the field "

"Right now graduate students here are working on programming projects that "
"are specifically intended for sale.  But if we create a climate of opinion "
"like that of five years ago, the university wouldn't dare to do this.  And "
