"Richard Stallman wrote this text, which was found in a file dated May 1983, "
"though it is not clear whether they were written then or earlier.  In May "
"1983 he was privately considering plans to develop a free operating system, "
"but he may not yet have decided to make it a Unix-like system rather than "
"something like the MIT Lisp Machine."

"One of the important reasons for giving software away free is to enable the "
"users to change it.  This allows them to make better use of it, and also "
"encourages and enables them to contribute to the effort.  Furthermore, they "
"develop self-reliance, confidence, and a sense of responsibility."

"I've often heard that Americans will think something is worthless if it's "
"free.  It might be true, but it's not rational.  People have a right to be "
"neurotic but we should not encourage this.  In the mean time, giving "
"software away is not &ldquo;treating it as worthless&rdquo; just because "
"some masochists might conclude it was worthless."

"Users would not change software if it were worthless; rather, because it is "

"I approached users in a non-manipulative cooperative spirit, and they "

"being imposed to trick their neuroses or because they are assumed in advance "
"to be incompetent, they feel justifiable resentment.  They also tend to "
"become incompetent and neurotic as a result."
