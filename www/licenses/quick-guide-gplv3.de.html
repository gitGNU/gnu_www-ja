<p>After a year and a half of public consultation, thousands of comments, and
four drafts, version 3 of the GNU General Public License (<a
class="reference external" href="/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a>) was
finally published on June&nbsp;29, 2007.  While there's been a lot of
discussion about the license since the first draft appeared, not many people
have talked about the benefits that it provides developers.  We've published
this guide to fill that gap.  We'll start with a brief refresher on free
software, copyleft, and the goals of the GPL.  We'll then review the major
changes in the license to see how they advance those goals and benefit
developers.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-foundations-of-the-gpl">
<h3>Grundlagen der GPL</h3>
<p>Niemand sollte durch die genutzte Software beschränkt werden. Es gibt vier
Freiheiten, die jeder Nutzer haben sollte:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>die Freiheit, das Programm für jeden Zweck auszuführen,</li>
<li>die Freiheit, das Programm eigenen Bedürfnissen anzupassen,</li>
<li>die Freiheit, die Software mit Freunden und Mitmenschen auszutauschen und</li>
<li>die Freiheit, gemachte Änderungen mit anderen auszutauschen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wenn ein Programm Benutzern alle diese Freiheiten bietet, nennen wir es <a
href="/philosophy/free-sw">Freie Software</a>.</p>
<p>Entwickler, die Software schreiben, können sie unter den Bedingungen des GNU
GPL freigeben. Wenn sie es tun, wird es Freie Software sein und bleiben,
ganz gleich, wer das Programm ändert oder vertreibt. Wir nennen dies
Copyleft: die Software unterliegt dem Urheberrecht, aber anstatt jene Rechte
anzuwenden, um Benutzer wie bei proprietärer Software zu beschränken, wenden
wir es an, um sicherzustellen, dass jeder Benutzer Freiheit hat.</p>
<p>Wir aktualisieren die GPL, um ihr Copyleft davor zu bewahren, nicht durch
rechtliche oder technische Entwicklungen untergraben zu werden. Die neueste
Version bewahrt Benutzer vor drei aktuellen Bedrohungen: </p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Tivoisierung</em>: Einige Unternehmen haben verschiedene Geräte
geschaffen, die GPL lizenzierte Software ausführen, und dann die Hardware so
manipuliert, damit sie die Software ändern können, nicht jedoch der
Nutzer. Wenn ein Gerät beliebige Software ausführen kann, ist es ein
Universalrechner, und sein Eigentümer sollte kontrollieren können, was
dieser macht. Wenn dies ein Gerät verhindert, nennen wir dies Tivoisierung.</li>
<li><em>Gesetze, die Freie Software verbieten:</em> Gesetze wie das
<i>US-Digital Millennium Copyright Act</i> (DMCA) und die
<i>EU-Urheberrechtsrichtlinie</i> machen es zu einem Verbrechen Software zu
schreiben oder zu teilen, die digitales Restriktionsmanagement
(engl. <i>Digital Restrictions Management</i>, kurz <i>DRM</i>; siehe <a
href="#neutralizing-laws-that-prohibit-free-software-but-not-forbidding-drm">unten</a>)
durchbrechen kann. Diese Gesetze sollten nicht die Rechte beeinflussen, die
die GPL gewährt.</li>
<li>Discriminatory patent deals: Microsoft has recently started telling people
that they will not sue free software users for patent infringement&mdash;as
long as you get the software from a vendor that's paying Microsoft for the
privilege.  Ultimately, Microsoft is trying to collect royalties for the use
of free software, which interferes with users' freedom.  No company should
be able to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 3 also has a number of improvements to make the license easier for
everyone to use and understand.  But even with all these changes, GPLv3
isn't a radical new license; instead it's an evolution of the previous
version.  Though a lot of text has changed, much of it simply clarifies what
GPLv2 said.  With that in mind, let's review the major changes in GPLv3, and
talk about how they improve the license for users and developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="neutralizing-laws-that-prohibit-free-software-but-not-forbidding-drm">
<h3>Gesetze neutralisieren, die Freie Software verbieten&#160;&#8209;&#160;aber
nicht DRM verbieten</h3>
<p>You're probably familiar with the Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) on
DVDs and other media.  You're probably also familiar with the laws that make
it illegal to write your own tools to bypass those restrictions, like the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European Union Copyright
Directive.  Nobody should be able to stop you from writing any code that you
want, and GPLv3 protects this right for you.</p>
<p>It's always possible to use GPLed code to write software that implements
DRM.  However, if someone does that with code protected by GPLv3, section 3
says that the system will not count as an effective technological
&quot;protection&quot; measure.  This means that if you break the DRM,
you'll be free to distribute your own software that does that, and you won't
be threatened by the DMCA or similar laws.</p>
<p>As usual, the GNU GPL does not restrict what people do in software; it just
stops them from restricting others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="protecting-your-right-to-tinker">
<h3>Das Recht herumzubasteln schützen</h3>
<p>Tivoization is a dangerous attempt to curtail users' freedom: the right to
modify your software will become meaningless if none of your computers let
you do it.  GPLv3 stops tivoization by requiring the distributor to provide
you with whatever information or data is necessary to install modified
software on the device.  This may be as simple as a set of instructions, or
it may include special data such as cryptographic keys or information about
how to bypass an integrity check in the hardware.  It will depend on how the
hardware was designed&mdash;but no matter what information you need, you
must be able to get it.</p>
<p>This requirement is limited in scope.  Distributors are still allowed to use
cryptographic keys for any purpose, and they'll only be required to disclose
a key if you need it to modify GPLed software on the device they gave you.
The GNU Project itself uses GnuPG to prove the integrity of all the software
on its FTP site, and measures like that are beneficial to users.  GPLv3 does
not stop people from using cryptography; we wouldn't want it to.  It only
stops people from taking away the rights that the license provides
you&mdash;whether through patent law, technology, or any other means.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stronger-protection-against-patent-threats">
<h3>Stärkerer Schutz vor Patentdrohungen</h3>
<p>In the 17 years since GPLv2 was published, the software patent landscape has
changed considerably, and free software licenses have developed new
strategies to address them.  GPLv3 reflects these changes too.  Whenever
someone conveys software covered by GPLv3 that they've written or modified,
they must provide every recipient with any patent licenses necessary to
exercise the rights that the GPL gives them.  In addition to that, if any
licensee tries to use a patent suit to stop another user from exercising
those rights, their license will be terminated.</p>
<p>What this means for users and developers is that they'll be able to work
with GPLv3-covered software without worrying that a desperate contributor
will try to sue them for patent infringement later.  With these changes,
GPLv3 affords its users more defenses against patent aggression than any
other free software license.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clarifying-license-compatibility">
<h3>Lizenzverträglichkeit klären</h3>
<p>If you found some code and wanted to incorporate it into a GPLed project,
GPLv2 said that the license on the other code was not allowed to have any
restrictions that were not already in GPLv2.  As long as that was the case,
we said the license was GPL-compatible.</p>
<p>However, some licenses had requirements that weren't really restrictive,
because they were so easy to comply with.  For example, some licenses say
that they don't give you permission to use certain trademarks.  That's not
really an additional restriction: if that clause wasn't there, you still
wouldn't have permission to use the trademark.  We always said those
licenses were compatible with GPLv2, too.</p>
<p>Now, GPLv3 explicitly gives everyone permission to use code that has
requirements like this.  These new terms should help clear up
misunderstandings about which licenses are GPL-compatible, why that is, and
what you can do with GPL-compatible code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-compatible-licenses">
<h3>Neue vereinbare Lizenzen</h3>
<p>In addition to clarifying the rules about licenses that are already
GPL-compatible, GPLv3 is also newly compatible with a few other licenses.
The Apache License 2.0 is a prime example.  Lots of great free software is
available under this license, with strong communities surrounding it.  We
hope that this change in GPLv3 will foster more cooperation and sharing
within the free software community.  The chart below helps illustrate some
common compatibility relationships between different free software licenses:</p>

<!-- GNUN: localize URL /licenses/quick-guide-gplv3-compatibility.de.png -->
<img alt="Diagramm, das die Vereinbarkeit zwischen verschiedenen freien
Softwarelizenzen veranschaulicht." class="align-center" src="/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3-compatibility.de.png" style="width: 594px; height: 498px;" />
<p>Arrows pointing from one license to another indicate that the first license
is compatible with the second.  This is true even if you follow multiple
arrows to get from one license to the other; so, for example, the ISC
license is compatible with GPLv3.  GPLv2 is compatible with GPLv3 if the
program allows you to choose &quot;any later version&quot; of the GPL, which
is the case for most software released under this license.  This diagram is
not comprehensive (see <a class="reference external"
href="/licenses/license-list.html">our licenses page</a> for a more complete
list of licenses compatible with GPLv2 and GPLv3), but plainly illustrates
that GPLv3 is compatible with just about everything GPLv2 is, and then some.</p>
<p>The GNU Affero GPL version 3 has also been brought into the fold.  The
original Affero GPL was designed to ensure that all users of a web
application would be able to receive its source.  The GNU Affero GPL version
3 broadens this goal: it is applicable to all network-interactive software,
so it will also work well for programs like game servers.  The additional
provision is also more flexible, so that if someone uses AGPLed source in an
application without a network interface, they'll only have to provide source
in the same sort of way the GPL has always required.  By making these two
licenses compatible, developers of network-interactive software will be able
to strengthen their copyleft while still building on top of the mature body
of GPLed code available to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-ways-for-developers-to-provide-source">
<h3>Mehr Möglichkeiten für Entwickler Quellcode bereitstellen</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental requirements of the GPL is that when you distribute
object code to users, you must also provide them with a way to get the
source.  GPLv2 gave you a few ways to do this, and GPLv3 keeps those intact
with some clarification.  It also offers you new ways to provide source when
you convey object code over a network.  For instance, when you host object
code on a web or FTP server, you can simply provide instructions that tell
visitors how to get the source from a third-party server.  Thanks to this
new option, fulfilling this requirement should be easier for many small
distributors who only make a few changes to large bodies of source.</p>
<p>The new license also makes it much easier to convey object code via
BitTorrent.  First, people who are merely downloading or seeding the torrent
are exempt from the license's requirements for conveying the software.
Then, whoever starts the torrent can provide source by simply telling other
torrent users where it is available on a public network server.</p>
<p>These new options help keep the GPL in line with community standards for
offering source, without making it harder for users to get.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="less-source-to-distribute-new-system-libraries-exception">
<h3>Weniger Quellcode zu verbreiten: Neue Systembibliotheken-Ausnahme</h3>
<p>Both versions of the GPL require you to provide all the source necessary to
build the software, including supporting libraries, compilation scripts, and
so on.  They also draw the line at System Libraries: you're not required to
provide the source for certain core components of the operating system, such
as the C library.</p>
<p>GPLv3 has adjusted the definition of System Library to include software that
may not come directly with the operating system, but that all users of the
software can reasonably be expected to have.  For example, it now also
includes the standard libraries of common programming languages such as
Python and Ruby.</p>
<p>The new definition also makes it clear that you can combine GPLed software
with GPL-incompatible System Libraries, such as OpenSolaris' C library, and
distribute them both together.  These changes will make life easier for free
software distributors who want to provide these combinations to their users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-global-license">
<h3>Eine allgemeine Lizenz</h3>
<p>GPLv2 talks about &quot;distribution&quot; a lot&mdash;when you share the
program with someone else, you're distributing it.  The license never says
what distribution is, because the term was borrowed from United States
copyright law.  We expected that judges would look there for the
definition.  However, we later found out that copyright laws in other
countries use the same word, but give it different meanings.  Because of
this, a judge in such a country might analyze GPLv2 differently than a judge
in the United States.</p>
<p>GPLv3 uses a new term, &quot;convey,&quot; and provides a definition for
that term.  &quot;Convey&quot; has the same meaning we intended for
&quot;distribute,&quot; but now that this is explained directly in the
license, it should be easy for people everywhere to understand what we
meant.  There are other minor changes throughout the license that will also
help ensure it is applied consistently worldwide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-the-rules-are-broken-a-smooth-path-to-compliance">
<h3>Wenn die Regeln gebrochen werden: Ein bequemen Weg zur Einhaltung</h3>
<p>Under GPLv2, if you violated the license in any way, your rights were
automatically and permanently lost.  The only way to get them back was to
petition the copyright holder.  While a strong defense against violations is
valuable, this policy could cause a lot of headache when someone
accidentally ran afoul of the rules.  Asking all the copyright holders for a
formal restoration of the license could be burdensome and costly: a typical
GNU/Linux distribution draws upon the work of thousands.</p>
<p>GPLv3 offers a reprieve for good behavior: if you violate the license,
you'll get your rights back once you stop the violation, unless a copyright
holder contacts you within 60 days.  After you receive such a notice, you
can have your rights fully restored if you're a first-time violator and
correct the violation within 30 days.  Otherwise, you can work out the issue
on a case-by-case basis with the copyright holders who contacted you, and
your rights will be restored afterward.</p>
<p>Compliance with the GPL has always been the top priority of the FSF
Compliance Lab and other groups enforcing the license worldwide.  These
changes ensure that compliance remains the top priority for enforcers, and
gives violators incentive to comply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-latest-and-greatest">
<h3>Das Neueste und Beste</h3>
<p>Some of these changes probably seem less important to you than others.
That's okay.  Every project is different, and needs different things from
its license.  But odds are that a number of these improvements will help you
and your work.</p>
<p>And taken as a whole, all these upgrades represent something more: we made a
better copyleft.  It does more to protect users' freedom, but it also
enables more cooperation in the free software community.  But updating the
license is only part of the job: in order for people to get the benefits it
offers, developers need to use GPLv3 for their projects, too.  By releasing
your own software under the new license, everyone who deals with
it&mdash;users, other developers, distributors, even lawyers&mdash;will
benefit.  We hope you'll use GPLv3 for your next release.</p>
