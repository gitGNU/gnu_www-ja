<h2>FSF Seminar: GPL Compliance Case Studies and Legal Ethics in Free Software
Licensing</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Columbia Law School, Columbia University New York, NY January 21, 2004 (9:00
am - 6:00 pm)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This one-day course presents the details of five different GPL compliance
cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance Laboratory.  Each case offers unique
insights into problems that can arise when the terms of GPL are not properly
followed, and how diplomatic negotiation between the violator and the
copyright holder can yield positive results for both parties.</p>
<p>
This course also includes a unit on the ethical considerations for attorneys
who want to represent clients that make use of or sell Free Software
products.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Attendees should have successfully completed the course, a <i>Detailed Study
and Analysis of GPL and LGPL</i>, as the material from that course forms the
building blocks for this material, or have attended a previous <i>Free
Software Licensing and the GNU GPL Seminar</i>.
</p>

<h3>Audience</h3> 

<p>The course is of most interest to lawyers who have clients or employers that
deal with Free Software on a regular basis.  However, technical managers and
executives whose businesses use or distribute Free Software will also find
the course very helpful.
</p>
<p>The course will include the topics listed below, along with ample time for
questions and discussions.
</p>
<h3>Lunchtime Speaker</h3>

<p><a href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/">Eben Moglen</a> will be the
lunchtime speaker.  Professor Moglen is Professor of Law and Legal History
at Columbia Law School and one of the nation's foremost scholars on
copyright, patents and the proposed &ldquo;Broadcast Flag&rdquo;.  He is
also a member of FSF's Board of Directors and the foundation's General
Counsel.  Professor Moglen has also written extensively on the SCO vs IBM
lawsuit.
</p>
<h3>GPL Compliance Case Studies</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Overview of FSF's GPL Compliance Lab</dt>
<dd>
<p>We present a brief introduction to the work that FSF does to enforce the GPL
and defend the freedoms granted by Free Software.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL Violation Case Study A
</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this case study, we consider one of the most complex and longest-running
violations that FSF has handled.  Company A distributed a derivative work of
the GNU Complier Collection (GCC) without complete corresponding source, and
refused to distribute any source at all to anyone who was not their direct
customer.  We follow the slow movement toward compliance and explain how FSF
deals with sometimes belligerent violators.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL Violation Case Study B</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this case study, we consider a contrasting violation to Case A.  Company
B, who sold a complete GNU/Linux distribution, had worked hard to be in
compliance, but we had nevertheless found an infraction in their compliance
efforts.  We explain how smoothly violations of this type can be resolved
and the process that an otherwise friendly violator can expect.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL Violation Case Study C</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this case study, we present a violation where an entire embedded
GNU/Linux distribution was included in a consumer electronic device.  We
consider the problems faced regarding kernel modules for device drivers for
government-regulated hardware, and cases where both an upstream provider and
a downstream distributor are in violation on separate matters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL Violation Case Study D</dt>
<dd>
<p>In this case study, we consider how to handle the inevitable violations that
can occur from a company that is generally committed to doing Free Software
as a regular part of its business, but &mdash; due to experimentation with
new cutting edge business models, or because of mere oversights &mdash; has
occasional GPL violations or near-violations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Good Practices for GPL Compliance</dt>
<dd>
<p>After discussing the details of the various archetypes of GPL compliance
efforts undertaken by FSF, we generalize what we have learned to advise on
good practices to build a product from start to finish in compliance with
GPL, and how to build internal policies to assure that your client or
company is never faced with a violation report.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Ethical Considerations for the Attorney Practicing Free Software</h3>

<p>This portion of the course will focus on ethical issues that may arise for
attorneys counseling clients with respect to free software issues.  Many of
these topics have more general application, but specific discussion of the
ways in which these issues may arise for free software clients will be
presented.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Part I: Representing Free Software Clients</dt>
<dd>
<p>An attorney's ethical duties run to not just their clients, but to potential
clients and the general public as well.  Pro bono representation of free
software clients not only conforms with the principles set forth by most Bar
Associations, but also provides many other benefits to an attorney.  Once a
client is retained, the duty of loyalty attaches and conflicts, be they
direct, indirect, or political, should be identified and handled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Part II: Practicing Free Software</dt>
<dd>
<p>Differing ethical issues arise in the context of counseling a client who is
a free software licensor as opposed to one who is a free software licensee.
Further still, representing a client who is both licensor and licensee
presents a combination of all of these issues.  Compliance investigation and
enforcement strategies must be implemented in accordance with both the duty
of loyalty and the duty of honesty.  Likewise, performing exposure abatement
while also defending against charges of infringement may pose problems
within the attorney-client relationship.  The ethical considerations
relevant to each of these situations will be presented and discussed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Part III: More General Ethical Considerations Relevant to Free Software
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Free software counseling is but one specialty within the realm of
intellectual property counseling in general.  A review of various topics of
more general application, but with special relevance to free software
counseling, will be given along with a discussion of the reasons why and
ways in which such issues arise when representing free software clients.
Patent prosecution and governing rules considerations are two such topics.
