<h2>JavaScript License Web Labels: Background and rationale</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Users browsing the Web nowadays typically run huge amounts of
proprietary software on their computers, often unknowingly.  Free
software is succeeding on the desktop partly because of the copyleft
protection guaranteeing users be told up front when a particular
program is free for them to use, study, share, and modify.  On the
Web, browsers download and run JavaScript without ever informing users
of the program's license or their freedoms &mdash; or how other
programs deny users' freedoms.</p>

<p>To address this problem, we developed
the <a href="/software/librejs"> LibreJS program </a> which recognizes
nontrivial JavaScript code and checks its license.  Its functioning
depends on specifying licenses in a way that a program which lacks
human intelligence can reliably recognize.  In addition, all GNU
software licenses require distributors to state the license with the
software, so recipients know their rights, and to say where to find
the source code.</p>

<p> The simple way to specify the license is with
a <a href="/philosophy/javascript-trap.html"> stylized comment in the
JavaScript code</a>.  However, that can be inconvenient for minified
library files, so we have developed another way to state their
licenses: <a href="/licenses/javascript-labels.html"> JavaScript web
labels</a>.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Conditions in free software licenses to include a copy of the
license terms and access to source code are almost always easy to
follow when software is distributed through the Web or other Internet
channels.  However, distributing JavaScript embedded in Web sites is
complicated by a couple of unique factors: visitors usually receive
the software without expressly requesting it, and webmasters can only
serve a single file of JavaScript code (so they can't, for example,
send an archive file that includes other resources required by the
license).</p>

<p>These issues combined leave webmasters with few obvious ways to
provide additional material required by free software licenses.  The
simplest solution would be to serve only JavaScript in source code
form, with a full copy of the license in its comments.  That can be
acceptable on smaller sites, but when JavaScript begins to represent a
lot of repeat traffic, webmasters are understandably reluctant to
serve so much data.  Our method gives them a clear place to serve
additional license resources&mdash;and visitors a clear place to look
for it&mdash;by addressing both of these points.  First, it makes the
software distribution visible by offering &ldquo;JavaScript license
information&rdquo; through a link.  The linked page gives webmasters a
space where they can publish those resources that's appropriately
prominent but not confusing to visitors.</p>

<h3>Machine readability</h3>

<p>In order to make it easier for people to reject nonfree JavaScript
in their browsers, our method is specific enough for a plug-in or
other software to find the site's table of JavaScript license
information, confirm that all of the JavaScript is under a known free
license, download the source code, and confirm that it corresponds to
the optimized JavaScript that's being served from the site.  This way,
visitors can quickly and conveniently check whether or not the
JavaScript is free, and decide accordingly whether or not they want to
run it.  <a href="/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> is a plug-in
for Mozilla-based browsers that helps users avoid running nonfree
JavaScript, and it will implement these checks to enhance its
capabilities.</p>

<p>We considered using another format like RDF as the basis for our
system, in order to simplify this job for programmers by giving them
more detailed information in an easily parsed format.  However, our
goal was to make this information accessible to human readers first,
and machines second.  Using well-structured HTML provided the best
match with those priorities.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>We are not saying that webmasters that host free software
JavaScript must follow this specific method to comply with the
licenses.  Every free software license clearly lays out its own
conditions, and any webmaster who wants to use a different method that
meets those conditions is welcome to do so.  However, this method has
the benefit of making full license information readily accessible to
visitors&mdash;an issue that's been a struggle to address to
date&mdash;without compromising webmasters' ability to serve
JavaScript the way they feel is best.</p>

<p>We are very interested to hear feedback and suggestions about other
ways we might accomplish the same goals, while making the system more
useful for webmasters, site visitors, or developers working on
license-checking software.  If we get enough suggestions to publish a
new method that's noticeably improved over this one, we'll do so.
(That's why this method uses such a verbose identifier for the license
information table: to allow software to distinguish this method from
others we might craft in the future.)  If this is an issue that you're
interested in,
please <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-librejs">subscribe
to the LibreJS mailing list</a>, and write there with your comments
and suggestions.  We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
