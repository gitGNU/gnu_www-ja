"Under US copyright law, which is the law under which most free software "
"programs have historically been first published, there are very substantial "
"procedural advantages to registration of copyright.  And despite the broad "
"right of distribution conveyed by the GPL, enforcement of copyright is "
"generally not possible for distributors: only the copyright holder or "
"someone having assignment of the copyright can enforce the license.  If "
"there are multiple authors of a copyrighted work, successful enforcement "
"depends on having the cooperation of all authors."

"In order to make sure that all of our copyrights can meet the recordkeeping "
"and other requirements of registration, and in order to be able to enforce "
"the GPL most effectively, FSF requires that each author of code incorporated "
"in FSF projects provide a copyright assignment, and, where appropriate, a "
"disclaimer of any work-for-hire ownership claims by the programmer's "
"employer.  That way we can be sure that all the code in FSF projects is free "
"code, whose freedom we can most effectively protect, and therefore on which "
"other developers can completely rely."
