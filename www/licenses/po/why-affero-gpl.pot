"The GNU Affero General Public License is a modified version of the ordinary "
"GNU GPL version 3.  It has one added requirement: if you run the program on "
"a server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must "
"also allow them to download the source code corresponding to the program "
"that it's running.  If what's running there is your modified version of the "
"program, the server's users must get the source code as you modified it."

"The purpose of the GNU Affero GPL is to prevent a problem that affects "
"developers of free programs that are often used on servers."

"Suppose you develop and release a free program under the ordinary GNU GPL.  "
"If developer D modifies the program and releases it, the GPL requires him to "
"distribute his version under the GPL too.  Thus, if you get a copy of his "
"version, you are free to incorporate some or all of his changes into your "
"own version."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But suppose the program is mainly useful on servers.  When D modifies the "
"program, he might very likely run it on his own server and never release "
"copies.  Then you would never get a copy of the source code of his version, "
"so you would never have the chance to include his changes in your version.  "
"You may not like that outcome."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Using the GNU Affero GPL avoids that outcome.  If D runs his version on a "
"server that everyone can use, you too can use it.  Assuming he has followed "
"the license requirement to let the server's users download the source code "
"of his version, you can do so, and then you can incorporate his changes into "
"your version.  (If he hasn't followed it, you have your lawyer complain to "
"him.)"

"Both the ordinary GNU GPL, version 3, and the GNU Affero GPL have text "

"The GNU Affero GPL does not address the problem of <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html\"> Service as a "
"Software Substitute (SaaSS)</a>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"SaaSS means that users use someone else's web server to do their own "
"computing.  This requires them to send their data to the server, which does "
"their computing for them and sends the results back to them.  SaaSS is an "
"injustice because the users cannot control their computing when it's done "
"that way."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If some program on this server is released under the GNU Affero GPL, the "
"server is required to offer the users the corresponding source of that "
"program.  That is good, but having this source code does not give them "
"control over the computing done on that server.  It also does not tell them "
"what other software may be running on that server, examining or changing "
"their data in other ways."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"We don't see any sensible way to address the SaaSS problem with license "
"conditions on particular programs.  Even to write a legal condition to "
"distinguish between SaaSS use and non-SaaSS use would be a challenge, and if "
"we had that, it is not clear what we would want to require in the SaaSS "
"case.  Thus, our solution to the problem of SaaSS is simple: refuse to use "
"it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If a program is meant specifically and only for SaaSS, you shouldn't write "
"it.  But many programs are useful for a variety of kinds of services, "
"including some that are SaaSS and some that are not.  It's useful to write "
"and release these programs so people can set up non-SaaSS services with "
"them, and good to release them under the AGPL."
