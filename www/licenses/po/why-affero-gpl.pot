"The GNU Affero General Public License is a modified version of the ordinary "
"GNU GPL version 3.  It has one added requirement: if you run the program on "
"a server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must "
"also allow them to download the source code corresponding to the program "
"that it's running.  If what's running there is your modified version of the "
"program, the server's users must get the source code as you modified it."

"The purpose of the GNU Affero GPL is to prevent a problem that affects "
"developers of free programs that are often used on servers."

"Suppose you develop and release a free program under the ordinary GNU GPL.  "
"If developer D modifies the program and releases it, the GPL requires him to "
"distribute his version under the GPL too.  Thus, if you get a copy of his "
"version, you are free to incorporate some or all of his changes into your "
"own version."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But suppose the program is mainly useful on servers.  When D modifies the "
"program, he might very likely run it on his own server and never release "
"copies.  Then you would never get a copy of the source code of his version, "
"so you would never have the chance to include his changes in your version.  "
"You may not like that outcome."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Using the GNU Affero GPL avoids that outcome.  If D runs his version on a "
"server that everyone can use, you too can use it.  Assuming he has followed "
"the license requirement to let the server's users download the source code "
"of his version, you can do so, and then you can incorporate his changes into "
"your version.  (If he hasn't followed it, you have your lawyer complain to "
"him.)"

"One problem which the GNU Affero GPL does not address is the problem of "
"Software as a Service (SaaS).  It is impossible, as far as we know, to "
"address this problem with a software license. <a "

"SaaS means the use of someone's network server, by others, to do work which "
"is their own computing.  They have to send their data to the server, which "
"does their computing for them, and sends the results back to them.  SaaS is "
"a problem because the users cannot control the computing which the server "
"does for them."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If some program on this server is released under the GNU Affero GPL, it "
"requires that the users have a way to download the corresponding source of "
"that program.  That is good, but having this source code does not give them "
"control over the computing the server does for them.  It also does not tell "
"them what other software may be running on that server, examining or "
"changing their data in other ways."
