"Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement</a> (HESSLA) is a software source "
"license that tries to put restrictions of ethical conduct on use and "
"modification of the software.  Because it restricts what jobs people can use "
"the software for, and restricts in substantive ways what jobs modified "
"versions of the program can do, it is not a free software license.  The "
"ironic result is that the community of people most likely to feel sympathy "
"for the goals of the HESSLA cannot contribute to HESSLA-covered software "
"without violating its principles."

"The restrictions in the HESSLA prohibit specific activities that are "
"inexcusable: violations of human rights, and introduction of features that "
"spy on the user.  People might ask why we do not declare an exception for "
"these particular restrictions&mdash;why do we stick to the general policy of "
"rejecting all restrictions on use and on the functionality of modified "
"versions?"

"If we were ever going to make an exception to our principles of free "
"software, here would be the place to do it.  But it would be a mistake to do "
"so: it would weaken our general stand, and would achieve nothing.  Trying to "
"stop those particular activities with a software license is either "
"unnecessary or ineffective."

"In regard to modified versions, the HESSLA's restrictions are unnecessary.  "
"The GNU GPL is sufficient protection against privacy-violating features, "
"because it ensures that someone can get the source code, find the spyware "
"feature, and publish an improved version of the software which does not have "
"the feature.  Users can then switch to that version if they don't want their "
"personal information to be reported."

"As for restricting the use of the software by governments that violate human "
"rights, this is likely to be ineffective.  There are many other programs "
"they can use.  Also, at least under US law, a copyright-based source license "
"can't restrict use of the program; such a restriction is not enforcible "
"anyway.  Meanwhile, they can simply decide they are exempt from the "
"restrictions."
