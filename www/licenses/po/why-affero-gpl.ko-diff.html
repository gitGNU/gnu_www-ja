&lt;title&gt;Why the GNU Affero GPL

&lt;h2&gt;Why the Affero GPL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GNU Affero General Public License is a modified version of the
ordinary GNU GPL version 3.  It has one added requirement: if you run
the program on a server and let other users communicate with it there,
your server must also allow them to download the source code
corresponding to the program that it's running.  If what's running
there is your modified version of the program, the server's users must
get the source code as you modified it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the GNU Affero GPL is to prevent a problem that
affects developers of free programs that are often used on
servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you develop and release a free program under the ordinary
GNU GPL.  If developer D modifies the program and releases it, the GPL
requires him to distribute his version under the GPL too.  Thus, if
you get a copy of his version, you are free to incorporate some or all
of his changes into your own version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suppose the program is mainly useful on servers.  When D
modifies the program, he might very likely run it on his own server
and never release copies.  Then you would never get a copy of the
source code of his version, so you would never have the chance to
include his changes in your version.  You may not like that
outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the GNU Affero GPL avoids that outcome.  If D runs his
version on a server that everyone can use, you too can use it.
Assuming he has followed the license requirement to let the server's
users download the source code of his version, you can do so, and then
you can incorporate his changes into your version.  (If he hasn't
followed it, you have your lawyer complain to him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the ordinary GNU GPL, version 3, and the GNU Affero GPL have
text allowing you to link together modules under these two licenses in
one program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Added a link to rms' article here. If it can be improved, please do it! --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem which the GNU Affero GPL does not address is the
problem of Software as a Service (SaaS).  It is impossible, as far as
we know, to address this problem with a software
license. &lt;a href="/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html"&gt;
[1] &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS means the use of someone's network server, by others, to do
work which is their own computing.  They have to send their data to
the server, which does their computing for them, and sends the results
back to them.  SaaS is a problem because the users cannot control the
computing which the server does for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some program on this server is released under the GNU Affero
GPL, it requires that the users have a way to download the
corresponding source of that program.  That is good, but having this
source code does not give them control over the computing the server
does for them.  It also does not tell them what other software may be
running on that server, examining or changing their data in other
ways.&lt;/p&gt;
