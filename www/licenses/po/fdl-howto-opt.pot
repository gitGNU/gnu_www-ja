"The classical example of an invariant nontechnical section in a free manual "
"is the <a href=\"/gnu/manifesto.html\">GNU Manifesto</a>, which is included "
"in the GNU Emacs Manual.  The GNU Manifesto says nothing about how to edit "
"with Emacs, but it explains the reason why I wrote GNU Emacs&mdash;to be an "
"essential part of the GNU operating system, which would give computer users "
"freedom to cooperate in a community.  Since the GNU Manifesto presents the "
"principles of the GNU Project, rather than features of GNU Emacs, we decided "
"that others should not remove or change it when redistributing the Emacs "
"Manual, and we wrote that requirement into the license.  In effect, we made "
"the GNU Manifesto into an invariant section, though without using that "
"term.  To do this today using the GNU FDL, we would write the license notice "
"like this:"

"The old Emacs Manual license did not allow others who modify and "
"redistribute the manual to add new invariant sections.  But while "
"formulating a more general version of the concept for the GNU FDL, I felt "
"that it would be more morally consistent if those who modify a manual can "
"write invariant sections, just as the first authors can.  The FDL permits "
"this."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"But that feature requires a safeguard to prevent it from being abused to "
"endanger the free status of the manual.  Person B who modifies a manual that "
"was written by person A should not be able to make any of person A's "
"documentation invariant, for that would deny person C the permission to "
"modify it further.  Likewise, if person B adds documentation for additional "
"subtopics, this added documentation must not be invariant; the documentation "
"itself must be modifiable by others.  The FDL's conditions on adding "
"invariant sections provide this safeguard."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"There is no need for a manual to have any invariant sections.  The simplest "
"case is to have none at all.  You do not have to list the GNU FDL itself as "
"an invariant section, because the FDL explicitly says that the FDL itself "
"may not be changed.  The FDL also distinguishes certain section titles, "
"&ldquo;History&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo; and others.  You should "
"not list these sections as invariant, because the FDL already gives the "
"rules for these sections."

"A cover text is a short piece of text that you insist must be printed on the "
"cover of the manual when the manual is published, even if someone else is "
"publishing it.  You can specify a &ldquo;front-cover text&rdquo; which has "
"to be printed on the front cover, and you can specify a &ldquo;back-cover "
"text&rdquo; which has to be printed on the back cover.  You can specify one "
"of each."

"Cover texts are a new feature, so I cannot cite past examples of their use, "
"but the intended purpose is simple.  They are meant to give the original "
"publisher of an edition a way to ask or encourage people to buy the copies "
"they publish rather than those of some other reprinter.  For example, we "
"could imagine specifying this as a back-cover text:"
