<h2>Exceptions to GNU Licenses</h2>

<h3>Autoconf Configure Script Exception</h3>

<p>The purpose of this exception is to allow distribution of
Autoconf's typical output under terms of the recipient's choice
(including proprietary).  This is necessary because Autoconf includes
some of its own code&mdash;which would otherwise be licensed under
GPLv3&mdash;in its output.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/licenses/autoconf-exception.html">Autoconf Configure
Script Exception</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>GCC Runtime Library Exception</h3>

<p>The purpose of this exception is to allow developers to compile
non-GPLed software with GCC, as long as they don't use proprietary
plugins or other extensions to the compiler.  An additional permission
is needed for this because GCC normally includes some GPLed code in
the binaries it creates.</p>

<h3>URLs</h3>

<p>When linking to the exceptions of GNU licenses, it's usually best
to link to the latest version; hence the standard URLs such as
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html have no version number.
Occasionally, however, you may want to link to a specific version of a
given license exception.  In those situations, you can use the
following links:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Autoconf Configure Script Exception</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/autoconf-exception-3.0.html">Autoconf
    Configure Script Exception v3.0</a></dd>

<dt>GCC Runtime Library Exception</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.1.html">GCC RLE
v3.1</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.0.html">GCC
RLE v3</a></dd>
