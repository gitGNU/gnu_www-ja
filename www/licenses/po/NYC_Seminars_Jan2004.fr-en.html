<h2>FSF Seminars in 2004</h2>

<blockquote><p>FSF Offers Seminars on Study and
 Analysis of the GPL and Legal Ethics in Free Software
 Licensing</p></blockquote>

<p>On January 20
 and 21, 2004, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) will offer two
 day-long seminars on Free Software Licensing and the GNU GPL at
 Columbia Law School in New York.  The two days will provide a
 detailed study and analysis of the GPL, review a few case
 studies and look at legal ethics in Free Software
 Licensing.  The
 seminars will be co-led by Daniel Ravicher, Senior Counsel to FSF and
 Bradley M. Kuhn, Executive Director of FSF.</p>

<p><i>Detailed Study and Analysis of GPL and LGPL</i>,
 the seminar on January 20, will give a section-by-section explanation
 of the most popular Free Software copyright license, the GNU General
 Public License (GNU GPL), and will educate lawyers, software
 developers, managers and business people on how to use the GPL (and
 GPL'd software) successfully in a new Free Software business and in
 existing, successful enterprises.
</p>

<p>On January 21, FSF will offer <i>GPL Compliance Case Studies
 and Legal Ethics in Free Software Licensing</i>.  Also a
 day-long seminar, which will present the details of five different
 GPL compliance cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance Laboratory.
 Each case offers unique insights into problems that can arise when
 the terms of GPL are not properly followed, and how diplomatic
 negotiation between the violator and the copyright holder can yield
 positive results for both parties.  This course also includes a unit
 on the ethical considerations for attorneys who want to represent
 clients that make use of or sell Free Software products.
</p>
