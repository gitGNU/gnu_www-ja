"The GNU Project has two principal licenses to use for libraries.  One is the "
"GNU Lesser GPL; the other is the ordinary GNU GPL.  The choice of license "
"makes a big difference: using the Lesser GPL permits use of the library in "
"proprietary programs; using the ordinary GPL for a library makes it "
"available only for free programs."

"Which license is best for a given library is a matter of strategy, and it "
"depends on the details of the situation.  At present, most GNU libraries are "
"covered by the Lesser GPL, and that means we are using only one of these two "
"strategies, neglecting the other.  So we are now seeking more libraries to "
"release <strong>under the ordinary GPL</strong>."

"Proprietary software developers have the advantage of money; free software "
"developers need to make advantages for each other.  Using the ordinary GPL "
"for a library gives free software developers an advantage over proprietary "
"developers: a library that they can use, while proprietary developers cannot "
"use it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Using the ordinary GPL is not advantageous for every library.  There are "
"reasons that can make it better to use the Lesser GPL in certain cases.  The "
"most common case is when a free library's features are readily available for "
"proprietary software through other alternative libraries.  In that case, the "
"library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better "
"to use the Lesser GPL for that library."

"This is why we used the Lesser GPL for the GNU C library.  After all, there "
"are plenty of other C libraries; using the GPL for ours would have driven "
"proprietary software developers to use another&mdash;no problem for them, "
"only for us."

"However, when a library provides a significant unique capability, like GNU "
"Readline, that's a horse of a different color.  The Readline library "
"implements input editing and history for interactive programs, and that's a "
"facility not generally available elsewhere.  Releasing it under the GPL and "
"limiting its use to free programs gives our community a real boost.  At "
"least one application program is free software today specifically because "
"that was necessary for using Readline."

"If we amass a collection of powerful GPL-covered libraries that have no "
"parallel available to proprietary software, they will provide a range of "
"useful modules to serve as building blocks in new free programs.  This will "
"be a significant advantage for further free software development, and some "
"projects will decide to make software free in order to use these libraries.  "
"University projects can easily be influenced; nowadays, as companies begin "
"to consider making software free, even some commercial projects can be "
"influenced in this way."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Proprietary software developers, seeking to deny the free competition an "
"important advantage, will try to convince authors not to contribute "
"libraries to the GPL-covered collection.  For example, they may appeal to "
"the ego, promising &ldquo;more users for this library&rdquo; if we let them "
"use the code in proprietary software products.  Popularity is tempting, and "
"it is easy for a library developer to rationalize the idea that boosting the "
"popularity of that one library is what the community needs above all."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But we should not listen to these temptations, because we can achieve much "
"more if we stand together.  We free software developers should support one "
"another.  By releasing libraries that are limited to free software only, we "
"can help each other's free software packages outdo the proprietary "
"alternatives.  The whole free software movement will have more popularity, "
"because free software as a whole will stack up better against the "
"competition."
