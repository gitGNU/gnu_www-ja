"current version of the license.  Since then, <a "

"It has always been the FSF's position that dynamically linking applications "
"to libraries creates a single work derived from both the library code and "
"the application code.  The GPL requires that all derivative works be "
"licensed as a whole under the terms of the GPL, an effect which can be "
"described as &ldquo;hereditary.&rdquo; So, if an application links to a "
"library licensed under the GPL, the application too must be licensed under "
"the GPL.  By contrast, libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General "
"Public License (LGPL) may be linked to proprietary applications."

"In July of 2003, Slashdot published a story claiming that I had claimed that "
"the LGPL did not function as intended in the case of Java.  This story was "
"based on a misunderstanding of a response to a question sent to "
"licensing@gnu.org, and many attempts to clarify the issue in the Slashdot "
"story did not get across.  I have received numerous questions about the "
"story since, via both licensing@gnu.org and personal email."

"FSF's position has remained constant throughout: the LGPL works as intended "
"with all known programming languages, including Java.  Applications which "
"link to LGPL libraries need not be released under the LGPL.  Applications "
"need only follow the requirements in section 6 of the LGPL: allow new "
"versions of the library to be linked with the application; and allow reverse "
"engineering to debug this."

"The typical arrangement for Java is that each library an application uses is "
"distributed as a separate JAR (Java Archive) file.  Applications use Java's "
"&ldquo;import&rdquo; functionality to access classes from these libraries.  "
"When the application is compiled, function signatures are checked against "
"the library, creating a link.  The application is then generally a "
"derivative work of the library.  So, the copyright holder for the library "
"must authorize distribution of the work.  The LGPL permits this "
"distribution."

"If you distribute a Java application that imports LGPL libraries, it's easy "
"to comply with the LGPL.  Your application's license needs to allow users to "
"modify the library, and reverse engineer your code to debug these "
"modifications.  This doesn't mean you need to provide source code or any "
"details about the internals of your application. Of course, some changes the "
"users may make to the library may break the interface, rendering the library "
"unable to work with your application.  You don't need to worry about "
"that&mdash;people who modify the library are responsible for making it work."

"When you distribute the library with your application (or on its own), you "
"need to include source code for the library.  But if your application "
"instead requires users to obtain the library on their own, you don't need to "
"provide source code for the library."

"The only difference between Java and C from the LGPL's perspective is that "
"Java is an object-oriented language, supporting inheritance.  The LGPL "
"contains no special provisions for inheritance, because none are needed.  "
"Inheritance creates derivative works in the same way as traditional linking, "
"and the LGPL permits this type of derivative work in the same way as it "
"permits ordinary function calls."
