"This one-day course presents the details of five different GPL compliance "

"copyright holder can yield positive results for both parties."

"In this case study, we consider one of the most complex and longest-running "

"This portion of the course will focus on ethical issues that may arise for "
"attorneys counseling clients with respect to free software issues.  Many of "

msgid ""
"An attorney's ethical duties run to not just their clients, but to potential "
"clients and the general public as well.  Pro bono representation of free "
"software clients not only conforms with the principles set forth by most Bar "
"Associations, but also provides many other benefits to an attorney.  Once a "
"client is retained, the duty of loyalty attaches and conflicts, be they "
"direct, indirect, or political, should be identified and handled."

msgid ""
"Differing ethical issues arise in the context of counseling a client who is "
"a free software licensor as opposed to one who is a free software licensee.  "
"Further still, representing a client who is both licensor and licensee "
"presents a combination of all of these issues.  Compliance investigation and "
"enforcement strategies must be implemented in accordance with both the duty "
"of loyalty and the duty of honesty.  Likewise, performing exposure abatement "
"while also defending against charges of infringement may pose problems "
"within the attorney-client relationship.  The ethical considerations "
"relevant to each of these situations will be presented and discussed."

"Free software counseling is but one specialty within the realm of "
"intellectual property counseling in general.  A review of various topics of "
"more general application, but with special relevance to free software "
"counseling, will be given along with a discussion of the reasons why and "
"ways in which such issues arise when representing free software clients.  "
"Patent prosecution and governing rules considerations are two such topics."
