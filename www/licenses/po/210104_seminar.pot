"An attorney's ethical duties run to not just their clients, but to potential "
"clients and the general public as well.  Pro bono representation of free "
"software clients not only conforms with the principles set forth by most Bar "
"Associations, but also provides many other benefits to an attorney.  Once a "
"client is retained, the duty of loyalty attaches and conflicts, be they "
"direct, indirect, or political, should be identified and handled."

"Differing ethical issues arise in the context of counseling a client who is "
"a free software licensor as opposed to one who is a free software licensee.  "
"Further still, representing a client who is both licensor and licensee "
"presents a combination of all of these issues.  Compliance investigation and "
"enforcement strategies must be implemented in accordance with both the duty "
"of loyalty and the duty of honesty.  Likewise, performing exposure abatement "
"while also defending against charges of infringement may pose problems "
"within the attorney-client relationship.  The ethical considerations "
