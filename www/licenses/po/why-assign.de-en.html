<h2>Why the FSF gets copyright assignments from contributors</h2>

<p>
by <strong>Professor Eben Moglen</strong>, Columbia University Law
School</p>

<p>
Under US copyright law, which is the law under which most free
software programs have historically been first published, there
are very substantial procedural advantages to registration of
copyright.  And despite the broad right of distribution conveyed by
the GPL, enforcement of copyright is generally not possible for
distributors: only the copyright holder or someone having assignment
of the copyright can enforce the license.  If there are multiple
authors of a copyrighted work, successful enforcement depends on
having the cooperation of all authors.</p>

<p>
In order to make sure that all of our copyrights can meet the
recordkeeping and other requirements of registration, and in order
to be able to enforce the GPL most effectively, FSF requires that
each author of code incorporated in FSF projects provide a copyright
assignment, and, where appropriate, a disclaimer of any
work-for-hire ownership claims by the programmer's employer.  That
way we can be sure that all the code in FSF projects is free code,
whose freedom we can most effectively protect, and therefore on
which other developers can completely rely.</p>
