"If you are a webmaster who wants to deploy JavaScript on your own site, we "
"suggest following the method below to label those files with license and "
"source code information.  It's especially useful in cases where the "
"JavaScript is under a GNU license, but does not include the permission in <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/javascript-trap.html#AppendixA\">Appendix A of &ldquo;The "
"JavaScript Trap.&rdquo;</a> Followed correctly, this method presents the "
"information prominently enough to comply with the relevant conditions in the "
"GNU software licenses, and it's specific enough that software can confirm "
"the correctness of the information on a site.  For more background, please "
"read our <a href=\"/licenses/javascript-labels-rationale.html\">rationale "
