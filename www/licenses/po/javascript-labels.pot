"If you are a webmaster deploying minified JavaScript on a site, here's a "
"method for stating their licenses and source code locations without altering "
"the minified files themselves.  It's especially helpful in cases where the "

"Using web labels presumes that the corresponding JavaScript source files "
"carry license notices that properly release them under a free license.  The "

"You can use web labels to machine-readably indicate the licenses of "
