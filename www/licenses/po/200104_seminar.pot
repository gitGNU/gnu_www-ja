"This one-day course gives a section-by-section explanation of the most "

"The ethical principles that motivated the creation of these licenses are "
"presented.  Unlike licenses that seek to lock up software in a proprietary "
"fashion, the GPL and LGPL are designed to grant freedom to innovate, learn "
"and improve. Those principles influence licensing policy decisions.  We "
"present the specific definition of the concept of &ldquo;Free "
"Software&rdquo; (software whose license grants freedoms to copy, share, "
"modify and redistribute the software either gratis or for a fee) for "
"for-profit companies."

msgid ""
"Free Software licensing in general, and the GPL and LGPL in particular, "
"relies critically on the concept of derivative work since software that is "
"independent (i.e., not derivative) of Free Software need not abide by any of "
"the terms of the applicable Free Software license.  If a work is a "
"derivative work of Free Software, then the terms of the license are "
"triggered, and one has obligations to comply with the terms of the Free "
"Software license under which the original work is distributed.  Therefore, "
"one is left to ask, just what is a &ldquo;derivative work?&rdquo; We will "
"show how the answer to that question depends on which court is being asked.  "
"We also present the best background information available to build a working "
"understanding of what is generally considered a derivate work in the rapidly "
"changing field of software copyright law."

"Source-only distribution works well for technically savvy clients and users, "
"but most want runnable binary programs as well.  Section 3 gives permission "
"for the creation and distribution of such binary works.  We explain how "
"GPL's requirement for corresponding source code operates, and detail what "
"distribution options are available to distributors of binary GPL'd "
"software.  We explore the benefits and downsides of each of those options."

"Patent rights are most often granted expressly, through detailed language in "
"a license.  However, express patent grants are not the exclusive way rights "
"in patents are granted by patentees.  Even without express language, patent "
"rights can be granted by a patentee's actions or behavior.  The GPL contains "
"no express patent grant.  Does that mean it grants less rights in the "
"licensor's patents than other licenses which do? Or, does the GPL, in its "
"silence, actually result in a grant of patent rights to the licensee greater "
"than what occurs through many other Free Software and &ldquo;Open "
"Source&rdquo; licenses?"

"Just as additional licensing restrictions cannot trump the GPL, outside "

"Almost all software licenses, including Free Software licenses such as the "
"GPL, contain sections, typically in all caps, regarding warranties and "

"attorneys understand the importance their language provides to both the "
"licensor and the licensee.  Some have argued that the GPL's Sections 11 and "

"derivative works are prohibited and permitted when basing the software on an "
