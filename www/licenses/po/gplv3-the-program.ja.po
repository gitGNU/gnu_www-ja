"Given that no choice is so clear that all other candidate meanings must be "

"Moreover, the usage of &quot;any&quot;, through its suggestion of selection "
"out of many qualifying possibilities, has the effect of emphasizing the "

"The broad reading of &quot;the Program&quot;, it has been suggested, gives "

"Close attention to the wording of the patent license grant, however, shows "

"Therefore, contributors are always the actual copyright licensors of the "

"otherwise, the patent license grant would be meaningless, because the "
"exercise of its permissions is tied to the contributor's &quot;contributor "
"version&quot;.  The contributors and the section 11 patent licensee stand in "
"a direct or indirect distribution relationship. Therefore, section 11, "
"paragraph 3 does not require you to grant a patent license to anyone who is "
"not also your copyright licensee.  (Non-contributor redistributors remain "
"subject to applicable implied patent license doctrine and to the special "
"&quot;automatic extension&quot; provision of section 11, paragraph 6.)"

"The FSF sympathizes with the intent of broad patent retaliation clauses in "

"provisions in software licenses are unlikely to benefit the community, "
"especially those clauses which can be triggered by patent litigation "
"concerning other programs unrelated to the software whose license "
"permissions are being terminated.  We were very cautious in taking steps to "
"incorporate patent retaliation into GPLv3, and the section 10, paragraph 3 "
