"Late last year, the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees the <a href="
"\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> project, passed a resolution "
"asking us to update the FDL so as to allow Wikipedia and similar Wikis using "
"the FDL to also use the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-"

"FDL 1.3 incorporates a couple of features that have been proposed for FDL "

"The primary change is the addition of section 11.  This new provision allows "
"certain materials released under this license to also be used under the "
"terms of CC-BY-SA 3.0.  For more information about exactly what materials "
"can be licensed this way, see the related questions below.  As part of this "
"change, we also introduced a new definition in section 1."

"We also borrowed a couple of changes from GPLv3.  The first is in section 9, "
"which explains how the license can be terminated when you violate it.  We "
"now provide a means for violators to automatically have their rights "
"restored if they cure the violation.  The second is in section 10: now "
"licensors can choose a proxy who is allowed to decide whether or not a work "
"can be licensed under the terms of future versions of the FDL."

"Section 11 has been added to allow wikis like Wikipedia to use FDL-covered "
"works under the terms of CC-BY-SA 3.0 if they choose to do so.  They have "
"told us that they would like to explore this option, and adding this "
"provision gives them a clear path to do so."

"Normally, these sorts of licensing decisions can and should be handled by "
"the copyright holder(s) of a particular work.  However, because Wikipedia "
"has many copyright holders, the project needed some alternative way to "
"accomplish this, and we've worked with them to provide that."

"The other changes are minor improvements that were easy to make while we "
"were at it.  They've met with wide approval in GPLv3, and they don't change "

"The work must be available under the terms of FDL 1.3, which provides you "

"Section 11 imposes two deadlines on licensees.  First, if a work was "
"originally published somewhere other than a public wiki, you can only use it "
"under CC-BY-SA 3.0 if it was added to a wiki before November 1, 2008.  We do "
"not want to grant people this permission for any and all works released "
"under the FDL.  We also do not want people gaming the system by adding FDLed "
"materials to a wiki, and then using them under CC-BY-SA afterwards.  "
"Choosing a deadline that has already passed unambiguously prevents this."

"Second, this permission is no longer available after August 1, 2009.  We "
"don't want this to become a general permission to switch between licenses: "
"the community will be much better off if each wiki makes its own decision "
"about which license it would rather use, and sticks with that.  This "
"deadline ensures that outcome, while still offering all wiki maintainers "
"ample time to make their decision."

"We are still accepting comments on this major new revision of the license.  "
"In the current FDL 2.0 draft, section 8(b) allows for relicensing of "
"materials in a wiki.  Since FDL 1.3 now provides this in section 11, it's no "
"longer necessary in FDL 2.0.  However, all the other changes proposed in the "
"draft would still be appropriate for the next version of the license, so "
"they're still on the table for discussion."
