"A year and a half ago, the Free Software Foundation released GPLv3.  It was "
"immediately adopted by fifteen GNU projects, and more made the switch in the "
"following months.  Most of the GCC codebase migrated to the new license in "
"the 4.2.2 release, and now we are preparing to finish that process."
msgstr ""
"Vor eineinhalb Jahren gab die Free Software Foundation die GPLv3 frei. Sie "
"wurde sofort von 15 GNU-Projekten angenommen und viele wechselten in den "
"folgenden Monaten. Das meiste der GCC Codebasis migrierte zur neuen Lizenz "
"in der Version 4.2.2 und nun wird der Abschluss dieses Prozesses vorbereitet."

"The licenses for some libraries that accompany GCC have not been changed "
"yet.  These libraries are automatically used by the object code that GCC "
"produces.  Because of that, if these libraries were simply distributed only "
"under the terms of the GPL, all the object code that GCC produces would have "
"to be distributed under the same terms.  However, the FSF decided long ago "
"to allow developers to use GCC's libraries to compile any program, "
"regardless of its license.  Developing nonfree software is not good for "
"society, and we have no obligation to make it easier.  We decided to permit "
"this because forbidding it seemed likely to backfire, and because using "
"small libraries to limit the use of GCC seemed like the tail wagging the dog."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Therefore, these libraries have always had license exceptions that allow "
"people to distribute the object code GCC produces under any license.  We are "
"now moving these libraries to GPLv3 and updating their exceptions.  Our "
"fundamental policy has not changed; the new license is meant to permit all "
"the uses of GCC that were permitted before.  However, we have decided to use "
"this opportunity to update the exception to accomplish three goals:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"Take advantage of GPLv3's new provisions.  GPLv3 features a number of new "
"terms which benefit all software.  These include section 7, which "
"establishes a framework for providing license exceptions.  In order for GCC "
"to get the most benefit from GPLv3, we need to update the exception to take "
"these new terms into account, and work within the parameters of section 7."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"Lay the groundwork for a plugin infrastructure in GCC.  For a while now, the "
"GCC developers have considered adding a plugin framework to the compiler.  "
"This would make it easier for others to contribute to the project, and "
"accelerate the development of new compilation techniques for GCC.  However, "
"there have also been concerns that unscrupulous developers could write "
"plugins that called out to proprietary software to transform the compiled "
"code&mdash;effectively creating proprietary extensions to GCC and defeating "
"the purpose of the GPL.  The updated exception prevents such abuse, enabling "
"the GCC team to look forward to plugin developments."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"Make exceptions throughout the GCC code base consistent.  Over the years, as "
"new files were added to GCC that needed to carry this license exception, we "
"reviewed and updated the language to help clarify it and address new "
"concerns.  As a result, there are now many different exception texts in GCC "
"that provide the same basic permissions.  Now all of those files will be "
"able to use the single new exception text that we've prepared, making it "
"easier to perform legal reviews on the code."

"As with GPLv3, we worked hard to listen to various users' concerns while we "
"drafted this, and address them appropriately.  All told, we have spent more "
"than a year on this process.  The Free Software Foundation and the GCC "
"Steering Committee would like to thank Richard Fontana, Bradley Kuhn, and "
"Karen Sandler at the Software Freedom Law Center for all their hard work and "
"assistance with the exception.  The changes here will strengthen the GCC "
"community, and we look forward to the compiler developments it will enable."

"Because GCC is such a crucial part of developers' lives, we're expecting "
"lots of questions about these changes, and we want to make sure that they're "

"You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining "
"the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would "

"When you write your software, it consists of a set of source code files.  "

"When you compile those source code files, they usually go through a series "
"of steps: source code generation, preprocessing, compilation to low-level "
"code, assembling, and linking.  Not all projects follow all these steps, "
"depending on what language you're using and how it's written, but they'll "
"always go in this order, and everyone using GCC will go through the process "
"of compiling high-level code into some low-level language such as assembly "
"code or Java bytecode.  This phase is when GCC combines or links your own "
"code with code from the GCC libraries.  We call it the &ldquo;Compilation "
"Process.&rdquo; The output you get from it is called &ldquo;Target Code,"
"&rdquo; as long as that output is not used as compiler intermediate "
"representation, or to create such an intermediate representation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In order to take advantage of this permission, the Compilation Process that "
"you use to create Target Code has to be &ldquo;Eligible,&rdquo; which means "
"that it does not involve both GCC and GPL-incompatible software.  It's "
"important to remember that the Compilation Process starts when you feed "
"<em>any</em> high-level code to GCC, and ends as soon as it generates "
"anything that can be considered Target Code.  Because of that, as long as "
"GCC isn't writing out intermediate representation, your Compilation Process "
"can still be Eligible even if you use GCC in conjunction with GPL-"
"incompatible assemblers, linkers, or high-level source generators: those "
"programs aren't involved in the Compilation Process as it's defined here.  "
"The only place you can't use GPL-incompatible software with GCC is when it's "
"performing the core compilation work."

"So, if you use GCC, with or without GPL-compatible enhancements, that would "
"be an Eligible Compilation Process.  If you only use GPL-incompatible "
"compiler tools, that would be an Eligible Compilation Process as well.  "
"(It's not uncommon for people who build software for GNU/Linux to link "
"against the GCC libraries even if they're using a different compiler.)  "
"However, if you used GCC in conjunction with GPL-incompatible software "
"during the process of transforming high-level code to low-level code, that "
"would <em>not</em> be an Eligible Compilation Process.  This would happen "
"if, for example, you used GCC with a proprietary plugin."
