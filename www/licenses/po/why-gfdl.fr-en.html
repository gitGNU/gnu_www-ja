<h2>Why publishers should use the GNU FDL</h2>

<p>by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a></p>

<p>
Can technical writers earn money by writing free documentation for
free software?  We seriously hope so, and that is the reason for
the GNU Free Documentation License.</p>
<p>
The GFDL is meant as a way to enlist commercial publishers in funding
free documentation without surrendering any vital liberty.  The
&ldquo;cover text&rdquo; feature, and certain other aspects of the
license that deal with covers, title page, history, and endorsements,
are included to make the license appealing to commercial publishers
for books whose authors are paid.  To improve the appeal, I consulted
specifically with staff of publishing companies, as well as lawyers,
free documentation writers, and the community at large, in writing the
GFDL.</p>
<p>
At least two commercial publishers of software manuals have told me
they are interested in using this license.  The future is never a sure
thing, but the GFDL looks like it has a good chance to succeed in
shaping a social system where commercial publishers pay people to
write commercial free manuals for free software.</p>
