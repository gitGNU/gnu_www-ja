"People often ask us what license we recommend they use for their project.  "
"We've written about this publicly before, but the information has been "
"scattered around between different essays, FAQ entries, and license "
"commentaries.  This article collects all that information into a single "
"source, to make it easier for people to follow and refer back to."

"These recommendations are for works designed to do practical jobs.  Those "
"include software, documentation, and some other things.  Works of art, and "
"works that state a point of view, are different issues; the GNU Project has "
"no general stand about how they should be released, except that they should "
"all be usable without nonfree software (in particular, <a "
"href=\"http://defectivebydesign.org/\">without DRM</a>).  However, you might "
"want to follow these recommendations for art works that go with a particular "
"program."

"The recommendations apply to licensing a work that you create&mdash;whether "
"that's a modification of an existing work, or a new original work.  They do "
"not address the issue of combining existing material under different "

"When you contribute to an existing project, you should usually release your "
"modified versions under the same license as the original work.  It's good to "
"cooperate with the project's maintainers, and using a different license for "
"your modifications often makes that cooperation very difficult.  You should "
"only do that when there is a strong reason to justify it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One case where using a different license can be justified is when you make "
"major changes to a work under a non-copyleft license.  If the version you've "
"created is considerably more useful than the original, then it's worth "
"copylefting your work, for all the same <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">reasons we normally recommend "
"copyleft</a>.  If you are in this situation, please follow the "
"recommendations below for licensing a new project."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"If you choose to release your contributions under a different license for "
"whatever reason, you must make sure that the original license allows use of "
"the material under your chosen license.  To minimize the impact on others, "
"show explicitly which parts of the work are under which license."

"We recommend different licenses for different projects, depending mostly on "
"the software's purpose.  In general, we recommend using the strongest "
"copyleft license that doesn't interfere with that purpose.  Our essay <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">&ldquo;What is Copyleft?&rdquo;</a> "
"explains the concept of copyleft in more detail, and why it is generally the "
"best licensing strategy."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"There are only a couple of kinds of projects that we think should not have "
"any copyleft at all.  The first is very small projects.  We use 300 lines as "
"our benchmark: when a software package's source code is shorter than that, "
"the benefits provided by copyleft are usually too small to justify the "
"inconvenience of making sure a copy of the license always accompanies the "
"software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The second is projects that implement free standards that are competing "
"against proprietary standards, such as Ogg Vorbis (which competes against "
"MP3 audio) and WebM (which competes against MPEG-4 video).  For these "
"projects, widespread use of the code is vital for advancing the cause of "
"free software, and does more good than a copyleft on the project's code "
"would do."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In these special situations where copyleft is not appropriate, we recommend "
"the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache License "
"2.0</a>.  This is a permissive, non-protective software license that has "
"terms to prevent contributors and distributors from suing for patent "
"infringement.  This doesn't make the software immune to threats from "
"patents, but it does prevent patent holders from setting up a &ldquo;bait "
"and switch&rdquo; where they release the software under free terms, but "
"require recipients to agree to royalties or other nonfree terms in a patent "
"license."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In all other cases, we recommend some kind of copyleft.  If your project is "
"a library, and developers are already using an established alternative "
"library released under a nonfree or permissive license, then we recommend "
"using the <a href=\"/licenses/lgpl.html\">GNU Lesser General Public License "
"(LGPL)</a>.  Unlike the case discussed earlier where the project implements "
"a standard, here adoption for its own sake will not accomplish any "
"particular goal, so there's no reason to avoid copyleft entirely.  However, "
"if you ask developers who use your library to release their work under a "
"full copyleft, they'll simply use one of the alternatives available, and "
"that won't advance our cause either.  The Lesser GPL was designed to fill "
"the middle ground between these cases, allowing proprietary software "
"developers to use the covered library, but providing a weak copyleft that "
"benefits users when they do.  If you want to learn more about our thinking "
"in these cases, read <a href=\"/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html\">&ldquo;Why you "
"shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library&rdquo;</a>."

"If your project could likely be run on a server after others improve it, "
"interacting with its users over a network, and you're concerned that fewer "
"developers will contribute to the released versions as a result, we "
"recommend the <a href=\"/licenses/agpl.html\">GNU Affero General Public "
"License (AGPL)</a>.  The AGPL's terms are almost identical to the GPL's; the "
"sole substantive difference is that it has an extra condition designed to "
"ensure that people who use the software over a network will be able to get "
"the source code for it.  This condition doesn't address every problem that "
"can arise when users do their computing on a server&mdash;it won't stop "
"users from being <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html\">harmed by "
"Software as a Service</a>&mdash;but it accomplishes as much as a license "
"can.  To learn more about these issues, read <a "

"In all other cases, we recommend that you use the most recent version of the "

"We recommend the <a href=\"/licenses/fdl.html\">GNU Free Documentation "
"License (GFDL)</a> for tutorials, reference manuals and other large works of "

"initially written for software manuals, and includes terms which "
"specifically address common issues that arise when those works are "
"distributed or modified."

"For short, secondary documentation works, such as a reference card, it is "
"better to use the <a href=\"/licenses/license-list.html#GNUAllPermissive\"> "

"Some documentation includes software source code.  For instance, a manual "
"for a programming language might include examples for readers to follow.  "
"You should both include these in the manual under the FDL's terms, and "
"release them under another license that's appropriate for software.  Doing "
"so helps make it easy to use the code in other projects.  We recommend that "
"you dedicate small pieces of code to the public domain using <a "
"href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a>, and distribute larger "
"pieces under the same license that the associated software project uses."

"If you are creating these works specifically for use with a software "

"we have recommended: GPLv3, LGPLv3, AGPLv3, and GPLv2 can all be applied to "
"any kind of work&mdash;not just software&mdash;that is copyrightable and has "
"a clear preferred form for modification.  Using the same license as the "
"software will help make compliance easier for distributors, and avoids any "
"doubt about potential compatibility issues.  Using a different free license "
"may be appropriate if it provides some specific practical benefit, like "
"better cooperation with other free projects."

"If your work is not being created for use with a particular software "
