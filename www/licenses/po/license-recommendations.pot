"People often ask us what license we recommend they use for their project.  "
"We've written about this publicly before, but the information has been "
"scattered around between different essays, FAQ entries, and license "
"commentaries.  This article collects all that information into a single "
"source, to make it easier for people to follow and refer back to."

"These recommendations are for works designed to do practical jobs.  Those "
"include software, documentation, and some other things.  Works of art, and "
"works that state a point of view, are different issues; the GNU Project has "
"no general stand about how they should be released, except that they should "
"all be usable without nonfree software (in particular, <a "
"href=\"http://defectivebydesign.org/\">without DRM</a>).  However, you might "
"want to follow these recommendations for art works that go with a particular "
"program."

"The recommendations apply to licensing a work that you create&mdash;whether "
"that's a modification of an existing work, or a new original work.  They do "
"not address the issue of combining existing material under different "

msgid ""
"When you contribute to an existing project, you should usually release your "
"modified versions under the same license as the original work.  It's good to "
"cooperate with the project's maintainers, and using a different license for "
"your modifications often makes that cooperation very difficult.  You should "
"only do that when there is a strong reason to justify it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One case where using a different license can be justified is when you make "
"major changes to a work under a non-copyleft license.  If the version you've "
"created is considerably more useful than the original, then it's worth "
"copylefting your work, for all the same <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">reasons we normally recommend "
"copyleft</a>.  If you are in this situation, please follow the "
"recommendations below for licensing a new project."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If you choose to release your contributions under a different license for "
"whatever reason, you must make sure that the original license allows use of "

"We recommend different licenses for different projects, depending mostly on "
"the software's purpose.  In general, we recommend using the strongest "
"copyleft license that doesn't interfere with that purpose.  Our essay <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">&ldquo;What is Copyleft?&rdquo;</a> "
"explains the concept of copyleft in more detail, and why it is generally the "
"best licensing strategy."

"For most programs, we recommend that you use the most recent version of the "
"<a href=\"/licenses/gpl.html\">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a> for your "
"project.  Its strong copyleft is appropriate for all kinds of software, and "
"includes numerous protections for users' freedom."

msgid ""
"It is not worth the trouble to use copyleft for most small programs.  We use "
"300 lines as our benchmark: when a software package's source code is shorter "
"than that, the benefits provided by copyleft are usually too small to "
"justify the inconvenience of making sure a copy of the license always "
"accompanies the software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For those programs, we recommend the <a "
"href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache License 2.0</a>.  "
"This is a pushover (non-copyleft) software license that has terms to prevent "
"contributors and distributors from suing for patent infringement.  This "
"doesn't make the software immune to threats from patents (a software license "
"can't do that), but it does prevent patent holders from setting up a "
"&ldquo;bait and switch&rdquo; where they release the software under free "
"terms then require recipients to agree to nonfree terms in a patent license."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Among the lax pushover licenses, Apache 2.0 is best; so if you are going to "
"use a lax pushover license, whatever the reason, we recommend using that "
"one."

msgid "For libraries, we distinguish three kind of cases."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Some libraries implement free standards that are competing against "
"restricted standards, such as Ogg Vorbis (which competes against MP3 audio) "
"and WebM (which competes against MPEG-4 video).  For these projects, "
"widespread use of the code is vital for advancing the cause of free "
"software, and does more good than a copyleft on the project's code would do."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"In these special situations, we recommend the <a "
"href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache License 2.0</a>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For all other libraries, we recommend some kind of copyleft.  If developers "
"are already using an established alternative library released under a "
"nonfree license or a lax pushover license, then we recommend using the <a "
"href=\"/licenses/lgpl.html\">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Unlike the first case, where the library implements an ethically superior "
"standard, here adoption for its own sake will not accomplish any special "
"objective goal, so there's no reason to avoid copyleft entirely.  However, "
"if you require developers who use your library to release their whole "
"programs under copyleft, they'll simply use one of the alternatives "
"available, and that won't advance our cause either.  The Lesser GPL was "
"designed to fill the middle ground between these cases, allowing proprietary "
"software developers to use the covered library, but providing a weak "
"copyleft that gives users freedom regarding the library code itself."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For libraries that provide specialized facilities, and which do not face "
"entrenched noncopylefted or nonfree competition, we recommend using the "
"plain GNU GPL.  For the reasons why, read <a "
"href=\"/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html\">&ldquo;Why you shouldn't use the Lesser "
"GPL for your next library&rdquo;</a>."

msgid ""
"If it is likely that others will make improved versions of your program to "
"run on servers and not distribute their versions to anyone else, and you're "
"concerned that this will put your released version at a disadvantage, we "
"recommend the <a href=\"/licenses/agpl.html\">GNU Affero General Public "
"License (AGPL)</a>.  The AGPL's terms are almost identical to the GPL's; the "
"sole substantive difference is that it has an extra condition to ensure that "
"people who use the software over a network will be able to get the source "
"code for it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The AGPL's requirement doesn't address the problems that can arise <em>for "
"users</em> when they entrust their computing or their data to someone else's "
"server.  For instance, it won't stop <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html\">Service as a "
"Software Substitute (SaaSS)</a> from denying users' freedom&mdash;but most "

"We recommend the <a href=\"/licenses/fdl.html\">GNU Free Documentation "
"License (GFDL)</a> for tutorials, reference manuals and other large works of "
"documentation.  It's a strong copyleft license for educational works, "
"initially written for software manuals, and includes terms which "
"specifically address common issues that arise when those works are "
"distributed or modified."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For short, secondary documentation works, such as a reference card, it is "
"better to use the <a href=\"/licenses/license-list.html#GNUAllPermissive\"> "
"GNU all-permissive license</a>, since a copy of the GFDL could hardly fit in "
"a reference card.  Don't use CC-BY, since it is incompatible with the GFDL."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For man pages, we recommend the GFDL if the page is long, and the <a "
"href=\"/licenses/license-list.html#GNUAllPermissive\"> GNU all-permissive "
"license</a> if it is short."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Some documentation includes software source code.  For instance, a manual "
"for a programming language might include examples for readers to follow.  "
"You should both include these in the manual under the FDL's terms, and "
"release them under another license that's appropriate for software.  Doing "
"so helps make it easy to use the code in other projects.  We recommend that "
"you dedicate small pieces of code to the public domain using <a "
"href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a>, and distribute larger "
"pieces under the same license that the associated software project uses."

"If you are creating these works specifically for use with a software "
"project, we generally recommend that you release your work under the same "
"license as the software.  There is no problem in doing so with the licenses "
"we have recommended: GPLv3, LGPLv3, AGPLv3, and GPLv2 can all be applied to "
"any kind of work&mdash;not just software&mdash;that is copyrightable and has "
"a clear preferred form for modification.  Using the same license as the "
"software will help make compliance easier for distributors, and avoids any "
"doubt about potential compatibility issues.  Using a different free license "
"may be appropriate if it provides some specific practical benefit, like "
"better cooperation with other free projects."

msgid ""
"If your work is not being created for use with a particular software "

"list</a>.  If no license seems especially appropriate, the <a "
