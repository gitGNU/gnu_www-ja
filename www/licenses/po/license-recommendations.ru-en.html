<h2>How to choose a license for your own work</h2>

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>People often ask us what license we recommend they use for their
project.  We've written about this publicly before, but the
information has been scattered around between different essays, FAQ
entries, and license commentaries.  This article collects all that
information into a single source, to make it easier for people to
follow and refer back to.</p>

<p>These recommendations are for works designed to do practical jobs.
Those include software, documentation, and some other things.  Works of
art, and works that state a point of view, are different issues; the GNU
Project has no general stand about how they should be released, except
that they should all be usable without nonfree software (in
particular, <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/">without DRM</a>).
However, you might want to follow these recommendations for art works
that go with a particular program.</p>

<p>The recommendations apply to licensing a work that you
create&mdash;whether that's a modification of an existing work, or a
new original work.  They do not address the issue of combining
existing material under different licenses.  If you're looking for
help with that, please check <a href="/licenses/gpl-faq.html">our GPL
FAQ</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contributing">Contributing to an existing project</h3>

<p>When you contribute to an existing project, you should usually release
your modified versions under the same license as the original work.
It's good to cooperate with the project's maintainers, and using a
different license for your modifications often makes that cooperation
very difficult.  You should only do that when there is a strong reason
to justify it.</p>

<p>One case where using a different license can be justified is when you make
major changes to a work under a non-copyleft license.  If the version you've
created is considerably more useful than the original, then it's worth
copylefting your work, for all the same
<a href="/copyleft/copyleft.html">reasons we normally recommend
copyleft</a>.  If you are in this situation, please follow the
recommendations below for licensing a new project.</p>

<p>If you choose to release your contributions under a different license
for whatever reason, you must make sure that the original license
allows use of the material under your chosen license.
To minimize the impact on others,
show explicitly which parts of the work are under which license.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>We recommend different licenses for different projects, depending
mostly on the software's purpose.  In general, we recommend using the
strongest copyleft license that doesn't interfere with that purpose.
Our essay <a href="/copyleft/copyleft.html">&ldquo;What
is Copyleft?&rdquo;</a> explains the
concept of copyleft in more detail, and why it is generally the best
licensing strategy.</p>

<p>There are only a couple of kinds of projects that we think should
not have any copyleft at all.  The first is very small projects.  We
use 300 lines as our benchmark: when a software package's source code
is shorter than that, the benefits provided by copyleft are usually
too small to justify the inconvenience of making sure a copy of the
license always accompanies the software.</p>

<p>The second is projects that implement free standards that are
competing against proprietary standards, such as Ogg Vorbis (which
competes against MP3 audio) and WebM (which competes against MPEG-4
video).  For these projects, widespread use of the code is vital for
advancing the cause of free software, and does more good than a
copyleft on the project's code would do.</p>

<p>In these special situations where copyleft is not appropriate, we recommend
the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>.  This is a permissive, non-protective
software license that has terms to prevent contributors and distributors
from suing for patent infringement.  This doesn't make the software immune
to threats from patents, but it does prevent patent holders from setting up a
&ldquo;bait and switch&rdquo; where they release the software under free
terms, but require recipients to agree to royalties or other nonfree terms
in a patent license.</p>

<p>In all other cases, we recommend some kind of copyleft.  If your project is
a library, and developers are already using an established alternative library
released under a nonfree or permissive license, then we recommend using
the <a href="/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>.  Unlike the case
discussed earlier where the project implements a standard, here adoption
for its own sake will not accomplish any particular goal, so there's no
reason to avoid copyleft entirely.  However, if you ask developers who
use your library to release their work under a full copyleft, they'll simply use one of the
alternatives available, and that won't advance our cause either.  The
Lesser GPL was designed to fill the middle ground between these cases,
allowing proprietary software developers to use the covered library, but
providing a weak copyleft that benefits users when they do.  If you want to
learn more about our thinking in these cases, read <a href="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">&ldquo;Why you
shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>If your project could likely be run on a server after others improve
it, interacting with its users over a network, and you're concerned
that fewer developers will contribute to the released versions as a result, we
recommend the <a href="/licenses/agpl.html">GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)</a>.  The
AGPL's terms are almost identical to the GPL's; the sole substantive
difference is that it has an extra condition designed to ensure that
people who use the software over a network will be able to get the
source code for it.  This condition doesn't address every problem that
can arise when users do their computing on a server&mdash;it won't
stop users from being <a href="/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">harmed by Software as a
Service</a>&mdash;but it accomplishes as much as a license can.  To
learn more about these issues, read <a href="/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html">&ldquo;Why the Affero
GPL&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>In all other cases, we recommend that you use the most recent version
of the <a href="/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a> for your project.  Its
strong copyleft is appropriate for all kinds of software, and includes
numerous protections for users' freedom.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>We recommend the <a href="/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL)</a> for tutorials, reference manuals and
other large works of documentation.  It's a strong copyleft license
for educational works, initially written for software manuals, and
includes terms which specifically address common issues that arise
when those works are distributed or modified.</p>

<p>For short, secondary documentation works, such as a reference card,
it is better to use
the <a href="/licenses/license-list.html#GNUAllPermissive"> GNU
all-permissive license</a>, since a copy of the GFDL could hardly fit
in a reference card.  Don't use CC-BY, since it is incompatible with
the GFDL.</p>

<p>For man pages, we recommend the GFDL if the page is long, and
the <a href="/licenses/license-list.html#GNUAllPermissive"> GNU
all-permissive license</a> if it is short.</p>

<p>Some documentation includes software source code.  For instance, a manual
for a programming language might include examples for readers to follow.
You should both include these in the manual under the FDL's terms, and
release them under another license that's appropriate for software.  Doing
so helps make it easy to use the code in other projects.  We recommend that
you dedicate small pieces of code to the public domain using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a>, and
distribute larger pieces under the same license that the associated
software project uses.</p>

<h3 id="data">Other data for programs</h3>

<p>This section discusses all other works for practical use that you
might include with software.  To give you some examples, this includes
icons and other functional or useful graphics, fonts, and geographic
data.  You can also follow them for art, though we wouldn't criticize
if you don't.</p>

<p>If you are creating these works specifically for use with a software
project, we generally recommend that you release your work under the
same license as the software.  There is no problem in doing so
with the licenses we have recommended:
GPLv3, LGPLv3, AGPLv3, and GPLv2 can all be applied to any kind of
work&mdash;not just software&mdash;that is copyrightable and has a clear
preferred form for modification.  Using the same license as the
software will help make compliance easier for distributors, and avoids
any doubt about potential compatibility issues.  Using a different
free license may be appropriate if it provides some specific practical
benefit, like better cooperation with other free projects.</p>

<p>If your work is not being created for use with a particular software
project, or if it wouldn't be appropriate to use the same license as
the project, then we only recommend that you choose a copyleft license
that's appropriate for your work.  We have some of these <a href="/licenses/license-list.html#OtherLicenses">listed on
our license list</a>.  If no license seems especially
appropriate, the <a href="/licenses/license-list.html#ccbysa">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a>
license is a copyleft that can be used for many different kinds of
works.</p>
