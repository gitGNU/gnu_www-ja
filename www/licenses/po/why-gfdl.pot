"The GFDL is meant as a way to enlist commercial publishers in funding free "
"documentation without surrendering any vital liberty.  The &ldquo;cover "
"text&rdquo; feature, and certain other aspects of the license that deal with "
"covers, title page, history, and endorsements, are included to make the "
"license appealing to commercial publishers for books whose authors are "
"paid.  To improve the appeal, I consulted specifically with staff of "
"publishing companies, as well as lawyers, free documentation writers, and "
"the community at large, in writing the GFDL."

"At least two commercial publishers of software manuals have told me they are "
"interested in using this license.  The future is never a sure thing, but the "
"GFDL looks like it has a good chance to succeed in shaping a social system "
"where commercial publishers pay people to write commercial free manuals for "
"free software."
