<h2>JavaScript License Web Labels</h2>

<p>If you are a webmaster deploying minified JavaScript on a site,
here's a method for stating their licenses and source code locations
without altering those files.  It's especially helpful in cases where
the JavaScript is under one of the GNU licenses, but does not include
the exception proposed
in <a href="/philosophy/javascript-trap.html#AppendixA"> Appendix A of
&ldquo;The JavaScript Trap.&rdquo;</a> This method presents the
information prominently enough to comply with the relevant conditions
in the GNU software licenses, and it's specific enough that software
can confirm the correctness of the information on a site.  For more
explanation of why we designed this format, see the
<a href="/licenses/javascript-labels-rationale.html"> rationale</a>.</p>

<p>The JavaScript license web labels method is meant for files of
minified JavaScript code.  You can also use it for non-minified
JavaScript source files if you wish; but if you're not aiming to make
the files small, you might as well put a copy of the license in the
source file.</p>

<p>The web label method is not applicable to inline JavaScript
included directly in HTML pages &mdash; their license information
should be <a href="/philosophy/javascript-trap.html#AppendixA"> stated
directly in those pages</a>.</p>

<h3>Writing the labels page</h3>

<p>Add a page for JavaScript license web labels to your site.  You can
use whatever path or filename is most convenient for you; others will
find it through links.  The page must include one table marked with
the attribute <code>id=&quot;jslicense-labels1&quot;</code>.  This name lets
automated tools find the table easily, and tells them what format to
expect.  Each row of this table will contain three cells, providing
information about a standalone JavaScript file used on the site, its
license, and how visitors can obtain its source code.</p>

<p>The first cell of each row names a JavaScript file used by the
site.  The cell must contain an anchor tag that links to that file,
just as
<code>script</code> tags throughout the site do.</p>

<p>The second cell provides information about the license of this
JavaScript file.  The cell must contain an anchor tag whose link
refers to the full license text, and whose text provides the license's
full name, and if the license has multiple versions, the version
number and whether or not the file is licensed under later versions of
the license.  Good license identifiers and their associated links
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU-GPL-2.0-or-later</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU-GPL-3.0-or-later</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">GNU-LGPL-2.1-or-later</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html">GNU-LGPL-3.0-or-later</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU-AGPL-3.0-or-later</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache-2.0-only</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5">Modified-BSD</a></li>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode">CC0-1.0-only</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/copying.txt">Expat</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0">MPL-2.0-or-later</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The third cell provides a link to the JavaScript's source code.
The source code file can be a single, unminified JavaScript file, a
<code>.tar.gz</code> archive, or a <code>.zip</code> archive.  If a source archive includes
multiple JavaScript files, the archive must include a file named
<code>00-INDEX</code> that lists the order in which individiual source files
should be concatenated to produce a single file that's
equivalent to what's hosted on the site.  If the JavaScript as it's
served from the site, and linked from the first cell, is already in
source code form, link to the same URL again in this cell.</p>

<p>Below is an example table for illustration.  This site just uses
one JavaScript file: a minified version of jQuery 1.7, distributed
under the Expat license.  The table lists the file with corresponding
license information and a link to full source code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=&quot;jslicense-labels1&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/js/jquery-1.7.min.js&quot;&gt;jquery-1.7.min.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jclark.com/xml/copying.txt&quot;&gt;Expat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/js/jquery-1.7.tar.gz&quot;&gt;jquery-1.7.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This page may include other text and markup, including your site's
normal layout and navigation tools, but the table must be displayed
prominently on it.</p>

<h3>Links to the labels page</h3>

<p>On each page that uses JavaScript, include a link that points to
the labels page described above.  Mark this link with the
attribute <code>rel=&quot;jslicense&quot;</code>, so that automated tools can
find it.  For example, your final link might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;/about/javascript&quot; rel=&quot;jslicense&quot;&gt;JavaScript license information&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This link can be small, but it should be clearly visible to people
who visit your site.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>If you do these things, you will comply with the relevant
conditions in the GNU software licenses, such as the GNU General
Public License.  They should also suffice to comply with many other
free software licenses, but we can't say with certainty that they will
comply with all of them.  As always, please make sure you understand
and follow the license conditions of any free software you
distribute.</p>
