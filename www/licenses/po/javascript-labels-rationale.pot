"We are very concerned about the growing problem of proprietary "
"JavaScript. The Web, which has done so much to enable the sharing and "
"understanding of free software, is now also a place where users&mdash;often "
"unknowingly&mdash;run huge amounts of proprietary software on their "
"computers. Free software is succeeding on the desktop partly because of the "
"copyleft protection guaranteeing users be told up front when a particular "
"program is free for them to use, study, share, and modify. But on the Web, "
"browsers download and run JavaScript without ever informing users of the "
"program's license or their freedoms."

"To begin addressing this problem, we have <a "
"href=\"/licenses/javascript-labels.html\">published a method</a> that "
"webmasters can use to label JavaScript served from their sites with license "
"information and source code links.  All GNU software licenses require "
"distributors to provide this information with the software so recipients "
"know they have the legal permission to share and change it, and access to "
"the source code they need to exercise those freedoms.  These conditions are "
"critical elements of the copyleft in these licenses, helping to keep the "
"software free for everyone who receives it."

"We believe that webmasters who use this system on their own sites will be in "
"compliance with the relevant conditions in the GNU software licenses and "
"many other popular free software licenses.  We also expect that most "
"webmasters will find this is the easiest way to comply with those terms, "
"especially when they serve optimized JavaScript."

"We also want to encourage webmasters to publish JavaScript licensing "
"information so that visitors can refuse nonfree JavaScript.  As Richard "
"Stallman explained in <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/javascript-trap.html\">&ldquo;The JavaScript "
"Trap,&rdquo;</a> nonfree JavaScript is just as dangerous as any other "
"nonfree software&mdash;and it's only made more insidious because browsers "
"typically download and run it without your knowledge."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Conditions in free software licenses to include a copy of the license terms "
"and access to source code are almost always easy to follow when software is "
"distributed through the Web or other Internet channels.  However, "
"distributing JavaScript embedded in Web sites is complicated by a couple of "
"unique factors: visitors usually receive the software without expressly "
"requesting it, and webmasters can only serve a single file of JavaScript "
"code (so they can't, for example, send an archive file that includes other "
"resources required by the license)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"These issues combined leave webmasters with few obvious ways to provide "
"additional material required by free software licenses.  The simplest "
"solution would be to serve only JavaScript in source code form, with a full "
"copy of the license in its comments.  That can be acceptable on smaller "
"sites, but when JavaScript begins to represent a lot of repeat traffic, "
"webmasters are understandably reluctant to serve so much data.  Our method "
"gives them a clear place to serve additional license resources&mdash;and "
"visitors a clear place to look for it&mdash;by addressing both of these "
"points.  First, it makes the software distribution visible by offering "
"&ldquo;JavaScript license information&rdquo; through a link.  The linked "
"page gives webmasters a space where they can publish those resources that's "
"appropriately prominent but not confusing to visitors."

"In order to make it easier for people to reject nonfree JavaScript in their "
"browsers, our method is specific enough for a plug-in or other software to "
"find the site's table of JavaScript license information, confirm that all of "
"the JavaScript is under a known free license, download the source code, and "
"confirm that it corresponds to the optimized JavaScript that's being served "
"from the site.  This way, visitors can quickly and conveniently check "
"whether or not the JavaScript is free, and decide accordingly whether or not "
"they want to run it.  <a href=\"http://lduros.net/librejs/\">LibreJS</a> is "
"a plug-in for Mozilla-based browsers that helps users avoid running nonfree "
"JavaScript, and it will implement these checks to enhance its capabilities."

"We considered using another format like RDF as the basis for our system, in "
"order to simplify this job for programmers by giving them more detailed "
"information in an easily parsed format.  However, our goal was to make this "
"information accessible to human readers first, and machines second.  Using "
"well-structured HTML provided the best match with those priorities."

"We are not saying that webmasters that host free software JavaScript must "
"follow this specific method to comply with the licenses.  Every free "
"software license clearly lays out its own conditions, and any webmaster who "
"wants to use a different method that meets those conditions is welcome to do "
"so.  However, this method has the benefit of making full license information "
"readily accessible to visitors&mdash;an issue that's been a struggle to "
"address to date&mdash;without compromising webmasters' ability to serve "
"JavaScript the way they feel is best."

"We are very interested to hear feedback and suggestions about other ways we "
"might accomplish the same goals, while making the system more useful for "
"webmasters, site visitors, or developers working on license-checking "
"software.  If we get enough suggestions to publish a new method that's "
"noticeably improved over this one, we'll do so.  (That's why this method "
"uses such a verbose identifier for the license information table: to allow "
"software to distinguish this method from others we might craft in the "
"future.)  If this is an issue that you're interested in, please <a "
"href=\"http://lduros.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/librejs\">subscribe to the "
"LibreJS mailing list</a>, and write there with your comments and "
"suggestions.  We look forward to hearing from you."
