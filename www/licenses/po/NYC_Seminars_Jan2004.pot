"<i>Detailed Study and Analysis of GPL and LGPL</i>, the seminar on January "
"20, will give a section-by-section explanation of the most popular Free "
"Software copyright license, the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), and "
"will educate lawyers, software developers, managers and business people on "
"how to use the GPL (and GPL'd software) successfully in a new Free Software "

"On January 21, FSF will offer <i>GPL Compliance Case Studies and Legal "
"Ethics in Free Software Licensing</i>.  Also a day-long seminar, which will "
"present the details of five different GPL compliance cases handled by FSF's "
"GPL Compliance Laboratory.  Each case offers unique insights into problems "
"that can arise when the terms of GPL are not properly followed, and how "
"diplomatic negotiation between the violator and the copyright holder can "
"yield positive results for both parties.  This course also includes a unit "
"on the ethical considerations for attorneys who want to represent clients "
"that make use of or sell Free Software products."
