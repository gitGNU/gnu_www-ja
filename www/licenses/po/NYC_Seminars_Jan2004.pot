"most popular Free Software copyright license, the GNU General Public License "
"(GNU GPL), and will educate lawyers, software developers, managers and "
"business people on how to use the GPL (and GPL'd software) successfully in a "

"On January 21, FSF will offer <b>&ldquo;GPL Compliance Case Studies and "
"Legal Ethics in Free Software Licensing&rdquo;</b>.  Also a day-long "
"seminar, which will present the details of five different GPL compliance "
"cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance Laboratory.  Each case offers unique "
"insights into problems that can arise when the terms of GPL are not properly "

"copyright holder can yield positive results for both parties.  This course "
