<h2>Tips on Using the GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<p>This is a brief explanation of how to place a document under the <a
href="/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.  For the
GNU software licenses, such as the GNU GPL, we have a <a
href="/licenses/gpl-howto.html">separate page</a>.</p>

optional features of the FDL?</a></dt>
<dd>
We have a <a href="/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html">separate page</a> that
discusses how to use the optional features of the FDL.</dd>

<dt>Where must one put the license notification?</dt>
<dd>
It is sufficient to put the full license notice in the
&ldquo;main&rdquo; file of your document.  For example, with
the <cite>Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, we have many files
included by <code>elisp.texi</code>.  We keep the full notification
in <code>elisp.texi</code>, and in the other files we simply write:

<pre>
@c -*-texinfo-*-
@c This is part of the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.
@c Copyright (C) 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999
@c   Free Software Foundation, Inc.
@c See the file elisp.texi for copying conditions.
</pre></dd>

<dt>What do I do with scripts that are needed to render my document
properly?</dt>
<dd>
We recommend you release these scripts under the GNU FDL as well.  Of
course, if these scripts are generally useful for other tasks, it is a
good idea to release them separately under the GNU GPL.</dd>

<dt>Is it required for the document to have invariant sections?</dt>
<dd>
No.  It is perfectly acceptable for a document to have no invariant
sections.</dd>

<dt>Should I try to make sure the document has some invariant
sections?</dt>
<dd>
Not particularly.  If a section's contents ought to be invariant, make
it invariant.</dd>

<dt>Should I try to avoid invariant sections?</dt>
<dd>
Not particularly.  If a section's contents ought to be invariant, make
it invariant.</dd>

<dt>When should a section be invariant?</dt>
<dd>
First of all, keep in mind that a section that treats technical
material <em>cannot</em> be invariant.  Only a secondary section can
be invariant, and a technical section is not a secondary section.
<p>
If the section is text that you're not allowed to modify, such as a
copy of the GNU GPL, then it <em>must</em> be invariant.  You can't
give permission to modify it if you don't have permission to modify
it.</p>
<p>
(One consequence is that you <em>cannot use</em> preexisting text
which covers technical material if you don't have permission to allow
modification of that text.)</p>
<p>
When a section discusses the philosophy of free software, it is a good
idea to make that section invariant.  For instance, when we put the
GNU Manifesto in a manual, or when we include a section explaining why
free documentation is important, we make that section
invariant.</p></dd>
