"The two major categories of free software license are <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">copyleft</a> and <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#Non-CopyleftedFreeSoftware\"> "
"non-copyleft</a>.  <a "
"href=\"/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses\">Copyleft "
"licenses</a> such as the <a href=\"/licenses/gpl.html\">GNU GPL</a> insist "
"that modified versions of the program must be free software as well.  "
"Non-copyleft licenses do not insist on this.  <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/why-copyleft.html\">We recommend copyleft</a>, because it "
"protects freedom for all users, but non-copylefted software can still be "
"free software, and useful to the free software community."

"There are many variants of simple <a "
"href=\"/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses\">non-copyleft free "
"software licenses</a>, such as the Expat license, FreeBSD license, X10 "
"license, the X11 license, and the two BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) "
"licenses.  Most of them are equivalent except for details of wording, but "
"the license used for BSD until 1999 had a special problem: the "
"&ldquo;obnoxious BSD advertising clause&rdquo;. It said that every "
"advertisement mentioning the software must include a particular sentence:"

"3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software\n"
"   must display the following acknowledgement:\n"
"     This product includes software developed by the University of\n"
"     California, Berkeley and its contributors.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Initially the obnoxious BSD advertising clause was used only in the Berkeley "
"Software Distribution.  That did not cause any particular problem, because "
"including one sentence in an ad is not a great practical difficulty."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If other developers who used BSD-like licenses had copied the BSD "
"advertising clause verbatim&mdash;including the sentence that refers to the "
"University of California&mdash;then they would not have made the problem any "
"bigger."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But, as you might expect, other developers did not copy the clause "
"verbatim.  They changed it, replacing &ldquo;University of California&rdquo; "
"with their own institution or their own names.  The result is a plethora of "
"licenses, requiring a plethora of different sentences."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"When people put many such programs together in an operating system, the "
"result is a serious problem.  Imagine if a software system required 75 "
"different sentences, each one naming a different author or group of "
"authors.  To advertise that, you would need a full-page ad."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This might seem like extrapolation ad absurdum, but it is actual fact.  In a "
"1997 version of NetBSD, I counted 75 of these sentences.  (Fortunately "
"NetBSD has decided to stop adding them, and to remove those it could.)"

#. type: Content of: <p>

"To address this problem, in my &ldquo;spare time&rdquo; I talk with "
"developers who have used BSD-style licenses, asking them if they would "
"please remove the advertising clause.  Around 1996 I spoke with the "
"developers of FreeBSD about this, and they decided to remove the advertising "
"clause from all of their own code.  In May 1998 the developers of Flick, at "
"the University of Utah, removed this clause."

"Dean Hal Varian at the University of California took up the cause, and "
"championed it with the administration.  In June 1999, after two years of "
"discussions, the University of California removed this clause from the "
"license of BSD."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Thus, there is now a new BSD license which does not contain the advertising "
"clause.  Unfortunately, this does not eliminate the legacy of the "
"advertising clause: similar clauses are still present in the licenses of "
"many packages which are not part of BSD.  The change in license for BSD has "
"no effect on the other packages which imitated the old BSD license; only the "
"developers who made them can change them."
msgstr ""

"But if they followed Berkeley's lead before, maybe Berkeley's change in "
"policy will convince some of them to change.  It's worth asking."

"So if you have a favorite package which still uses the BSD license with the "
"advertising clause, please ask the maintainer to look at this web page, and "
"consider making the change."

msgid ""
"And if you want to release a program as non-copylefted free software, please "
"don't use the advertising clause.  Thus, instead of copying the BSD license "
"from some released package&mdash;which might still have the old version of "
"the license in it&mdash;please use one of the other permissive licenses, "
"such as Expat or FreeBSD."

"You can also help spread awareness of the issue by not using the term "
"&ldquo;BSD-style&rdquo;, and not saying &ldquo;the BSD license&rdquo; which "
"implies there is only one.  You see, when people refer to all non-copyleft "
"free software licenses as &ldquo;BSD-style licenses&rdquo;, some new free "
"software developer who wants to use a non-copyleft free software license "
"might take for granted that the place to get it is from BSD.  He or she "
"might copy the license with the advertising clause, not by specific "
"intention, just by chance."

"If you would like to cite one specific example of a non-copyleft license, "
"and you have no particular preference, please pick an example which has no "
"particular problem.  For instance, if you talk about &ldquo;X11-style "
"licenses&rdquo;, you will encourage people to copy the license from X11, "
"which avoids the advertising clause for certain, rather than take a risk by "
"randomly choosing one of the BSD licenses."

"Or you could mention the non-copyleft license which <a "
"href=\"/licenses/license-recommendations.html\"> we recommend over the other "
"non-copyleft licenses</a>: the Apache 2.0 license, which has a clause to "

"When you want to refer specifically to one of the BSD licenses, please "

"Later a third BSD license variant was introduced, with only the first two of "
"the original BSD license's four clauses.  We call it the &ldquo;FreeBSD "
"license.&rdquo; It is a lax, noncopyleft free license, compatible with the "
"GNU GPL, much like the modified BSD license."
