<h2>FSF-Seminar: Detailed Study and Analysis of GPL and LGPL</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Columbia Law School, Columbia University New York, NY January 20, 2004 (9:00
am - 6:00 pm)
</p></blockquote>

<p>This one-day course gives a section-by-section explanation of the most
popular Free Software copyright license, the GNU General Public License
(GPL), and teaches lawyers, software developers, managers and business
people how to use the GPL (and GPL'd software)  successfully in a new Free
Software business and in existing, successful enterprises.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Attendees should have a general familiarity with software development
processes.  A basic understanding of how copyright law typically applies to
software is also helpful.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>

<p>The course is of most interest to lawyers, software developers and managers
who run (or have clients who run) software businesses that modify and/or
redistribute software under terms of the GNU GPL or LGPL, or who wish to
make use of existing GPL'd and LGPL'd software in their enterprise.
</p>
<p>The course will include the topics listed below, along with ample time for
questions and discussions.
</p>

<h3>Lunchtime Speaker</h3>

<p><a href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/">Eben Moglen</a> will be the
lunchtime speaker.  Professor Moglen is Professor of Law and Legal History
at Columbia Law School and one of the nation's foremost scholars on
copyright, patents and the proposed &ldquo;Broadcast Flag&rdquo;.  He is
also a member of FSF's Board of Directors and the foundation's General
Counsel.  Professor Moglen has also written extensively on the SCO vs IBM
lawsuit.

<dl>
<dt>Free Software Principles and the Free Software Definition
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ethical principles that motivated the creation of these licenses are
presented.  Unlike licenses that seek to lock up software in a proprietary
fashion, the GPL and LGPL are designed to grant freedom to innovate, learn
and improve. Those principles influence licensing policy decisions.  We
present the specific definition of the concept of &ldquo;Free
Software&rdquo; (software whose license grants freedoms to copy, share,
modify and redistribute the software either gratis or for a fee) for
for-profit companies.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Preamble of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
</dt>
<dd>
<p> The preamble presents the intent of the license.  The preamble puts forth
the motivations for the detailed terms and conditions that follow in the
license.  We discuss the language of the preamble in detail to show how it
frames the legal details that follow.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> GPL, Section 0: Definitions, etc.
</dt>
<dd>
<p> GPL's Section 0 defines and presents the terms that make the basis of this
copyright license.  We discuss those definitions and the copyright scope of
the license.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 1: Grant for Verbatim Source Copying
</dt>
<dd>
<p> Section 1 defines the terms for making source-only copies of software
programs.  We discuss how those rules work and the requirements and
obligations for distributors of GPL'd source, whether they choose to
distribute at no charge or for fees.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Derivative Works: Statute and Case Law</dt>
<dd>
<p> Free Software licensing in general, and the GPL and LGPL in particular,
relies critically on the concept of derivative work since software that is
independent (i.e., not derivative) of Free Software need not abide by any of
the terms of the applicable Free Software license.  If a work is a
derivative work of Free Software, then the terms of the license are
triggered, and one has obligations to comply with the terms of the Free
Software license under which the original work is distributed.  Therefore,
one is left to ask, just what is a &ldquo;derivative work?&rdquo; We will
show how the answer to that question depends on which court is being asked.
We also present the best background information available to build a working
understanding of what is generally considered a derivate work in the rapidly
changing field of software copyright law.</p>
</dd>
<dt> GPL, Section 2: Grants for Source Derivative Works</dt>
<dd>
<p> Section 2 sets forth the rules for creation of derivative works of GPL'd
software.  We discuss the intent of this section of GPL and how it relates
to the copyright situation discussed in our discussion of derivative works.
We also explain the details of preparing derivative source in a
GPL-compliant way.</p>
</dd>
<dt> GPL, Section 3: Grants for Creating Binary Derivative Works</dt>
<dd>
<p> Source-only distribution works well for technically savvy clients and users,
but most want runnable binary programs as well.  Section 3 gives permission
for the creation and distribution of such binary works.  We explain how
GPL's requirement for corresponding source code operates, and detail what
distribution options are available to distributors of binary GPL'd
software.  We explore the benefits and downsides of each of those options.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Implied Patent Grant in GPL</dt>
<dd>
<p> Patent rights are most often granted expressly, through detailed language in
a license.  However, express patent grants are not the exclusive way rights
in patents are granted by patentees.  Even without express language, patent
rights can be granted by a patentee's actions or behavior.  The GPL contains
no express patent grant.  Does that mean it grants less rights in the
licensor's patents than other licenses which do? Or, does the GPL, in its
silence, actually result in a grant of patent rights to the licensee greater
than what occurs through many other Free Software and &ldquo;Open
Source&rdquo; licenses?
</p>
<p>We will consider these questions and provide detailed answers to them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 4: Termination of License
</dt>
<dd>
<p> Section 4 terminates rights under the GPL for those who violate it.  We
discuss how such termination works, what it means for violators, what risks
one takes in violating, and how rights are typically restored.  We briefly
mention how Section 4 is used as the central tool in GPL enforcement.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 5: Acceptance of License
</dt>
<dd>
<p> GPL is not a contract, so acceptance of the license works differently than
it does for contracts.  We discuss how this acceptance works under the
copyright rules that govern the GPL.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 6: Prohibition on Further Restrictions</dt>
<dd>
<p> Other licensing terms cannot be placed on GPL'd software that would trump
the rights granted under GPL.  We discuss how Section 6 is used to ensure
that no such additional restrictions occur.  We briefly discuss how this
leads to the concept of GPL-incompatible Free Software licenses.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 7: Conflicts with Other Agreements or Orders</dt>
<dd>
<p> Just as additional licensing restrictions cannot trump the GPL, outside
agreements, patent licenses or court orders cannot do so either.  We discuss
how Section 7 ensures that other rules outside of the direct software
license cannot take rights away from users, distributors, and modifiers of
GPL'd software.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 8: International Licensing Issues</dt>
<dd>
<p> Section 8 is a rarely used part of the GPL that helps copyright holders when
certain technologies are prohibited from full international distribution due
to draconian rules elsewhere in the world.  We explain how Section 8 helps
such copyright holders.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 9: FSF as GPL's Stewards</dt>
<dd>
<p> We discuss how the update process and release of new GPL versions happens.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 10: Copyright Holder's Exceptions to GPL</dt>
<dd>
<p> Section 10 reminds licensees that under copyright law, other relicensing
arrangements can be made.  We discuss how this can often be used as a
business model and we explicate that model's benefits and downsides.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 11: Disclaimer of Warranties</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>GPL, Section 12: Limitation of Liability</dt>
<dd>
<p> Almost all software licenses, including Free Software licenses such as the
GPL, contain sections, typically in all caps, regarding warranties and
liability.  The purposes of these sections are lost on most non-lawyers, but
attorneys understand the importance their language provides to both the
licensor and the licensee.  Some have argued that the GPL's Sections 11 and
12 render it entirely unenforceable.  We consider whether that is true, and
present the likely interpretation and implementation of the GPL's Warranty
Disclaimer and Liability Limitation provisions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</dt>
<dd>
<p> The LGPL is a &ldquo;scaled back&rdquo; version of GPL, designed
specifically to allow creation of a very well-defined class of proprietary
derivative works.  However, it does prohibit turning the LGPL'd software
itself directly into proprietary software.
</p>
<p> We discuss the basic design of LGPL and how it compares and contrasts with
GPL.  We introduce the two classes of derivative works covered by LGPL,
&ldquo;works that use the library&rdquo; and &ldquo;works based on the
library&rdquo;, and give some concrete examples of what proprietary
derivative works are prohibited and permitted when basing the software on an
LGPL'd work.
