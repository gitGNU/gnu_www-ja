#~ "\n"
#~ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
#~ "price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\n"
#~ "sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\n"
#~ "software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\n"
#~ "that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n"
#~ "anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n"
#~ "These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n"
#~ "distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\n"
#~ "gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n"
#~ "you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n"
#~ "source code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n"
#~ "\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n"
#~ "   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\n"
#~ "contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\n"
#~ "distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n"
#~ "\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work "
#~ "based\n"
#~ "on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the\n"
#~ "Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\n"
#~ "licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n"
#~ "code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously "
#~ "and\n"
#~ "appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n"
#~ "disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\n"
#~ "General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\n"
#~ "other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\n"
#~ "along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\n"
#~ "transferring a copy.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n"
#~ "it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of "
#~ "Paragraph\n"
#~ "1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n"
#~ "    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n"
#~ "    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n"
#~ "    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n"
#~ "    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n"
#~ "    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n"
#~ "    third parties, at your option).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively "
#~ "when\n"
#~ "    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive "
#~ "use\n"
#~ "    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n"
#~ "    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n"
#~ "    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n"
#~ "    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n"
#~ "    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n"
#~ "    Public License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n"
#~ "    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n"
#~ "    exchange for a fee.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\n"
#~ "derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not "
#~ "bring\n"
#~ "the other work under the scope of these terms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative "
#~ "of\n"
#~ "it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms "
#~ "of\n"
#~ "Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n"
#~ "    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n"
#~ "    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n"
#~ "    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n"
#~ "    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of "
#~ "the\n"
#~ "    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n"
#~ "    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n"
#~ "    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n"
#~ "    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n"
#~ "    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n"
#~ "modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\n"
#~ "all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\n"
#~ "exception, it need not include source code for modules which are "
#~ "standard\n"
#~ "libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\n"
#~ "file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\n"
#~ "accompany that operating system.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\n"
#~ "Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\n"
#~ "Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or "
#~ "transfer\n"
#~ "the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\n"
#~ "the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\n"
#~ "copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\n"
#~ "License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\n"
#~ "remain in full compliance.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work "
#~ "based\n"
#~ "on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\n"
#~ "and all its terms and conditions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n"
#~ "Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the "
#~ "original\n"
#~ "licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\n"
#~ "terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on "
#~ "the\n"
#~ "recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new "
#~ "versions\n"
#~ "of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n"
#~ "be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n"
#~ "address new problems or concerns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n"
#~ "specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any\n"
#~ "later version\", you have the option of following the terms and "
#~ "conditions\n"
#~ "either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n"
#~ "Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number "
#~ "of\n"
#~ "the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free "
#~ "Software\n"
#~ "Foundation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n"
#~ "programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the "
#~ "author\n"
#~ "to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n"
#~ "Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n"
#~ "make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n"
#~ "of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software "
#~ "and\n"
#~ "of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "                            NO WARRANTY\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO "
#~ "WARRANTY\n"
#~ "FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n"
#~ "OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n"
#~ "PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER "
#~ "EXPRESSED\n"
#~ "OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n"
#~ "MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK "
#~ "AS\n"
#~ "TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n"
#~ "PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n"
#~ "REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN "
#~ "WRITING\n"
#~ "WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n"
#~ "REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR "
#~ "DAMAGES,\n"
#~ "INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES "
#~ "ARISING\n"
#~ "OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT "
#~ "LIMITED\n"
#~ "TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n"
#~ "YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY "
#~ "OTHER\n"
#~ "PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n"
#~ "POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"

#~ "  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n"

#~ "of\n"
#~ "Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n"

#~ "    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n"

#~ "    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n"
#~ "    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n"
#~ "    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n"
#~ "    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n"

#~ "Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or "
#~ "transfer\n"
#~ "the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\n"
#~ "the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\n"

#~ "terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on "

#~ "address new problems or concerns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n"

#~ "conditions\n"
#~ "either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n"

#~ "Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n"

#~ "of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software "

#~ "WARRANTY\n"
#~ "FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n"
