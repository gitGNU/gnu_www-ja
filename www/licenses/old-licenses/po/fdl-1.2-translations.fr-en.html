<h2>Unofficial GNU FDL v1.2 Translations</h2>

<h3 id="UnofficialTranslations">Information about unofficial
translations</h3>

<p>
The reason the FSF does not approve these translations as officially
valid is that checking them would be difficult and expensive (needing
the help of bilingual lawyers in other countries).  Even worse, if an
error did slip through, the results could be disastrous for the whole
free software community.  As long as the translations are unofficial,
they can't do any harm.</p>

<p>The purpose of linking to translations is to help more people
understand the FDL.  In order for them to do that, translations
need to be basically accurate even if not perfect.  To produce a good
translation, it is essential to have fully understood fundamental
concepts such as <a href="/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a> and
the <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software definition</a>.
For this reason, those who wish to contribute translations should make
sure they are well acquainted with these concepts as well as other
philosophical principles that may appear in the document.</p>

<p>We give permission to publish translations of the GNU FDL
into other languages, provided that:</p>

<ol>

<li>You label your translation as unofficial to inform people that
they do not count legally as substitutes for the authentic version
(see below for how to do this).</li>

<li>You agree to install changes at our request, if we learn from other
friends of GNU that changes are necessary to make the translation
clearer.</li>

<li>The translation is not hosted on a commercial site and does not
refer to any company.</li>

<li>The page containing the translation should have no links
except to fsf.org and gnu.org.  We might accept links about
other free software packages, but we prefer to avoid them.</li>

<li>The page should say it is released under some version of the
Creative Commons Attribution Noderivs license.</li>

<li>We may accept small exceptions to these rules in
legacy cases that are hard to fix.</li>

</ol>

<p>We do not necessarily link to all the unofficial translations that
we know of in any given language.  For instance, if one unofficial
translation was made by a free software organization that we know and
have confidence in, we will link to that translation rather than others.
We still can't make it official, but we expect it is probably mostly
correct.</p>

<p>
To label your translations as unofficial, please add the
following text at the beginning,
both in English and in the language of the translation.  Replace
<tt>language</tt> with the name of that language:</p>

<blockquote dir="ltr"><p>
<!--TRANSLATORS: If you translate this paragraph, retain the English
text and put your translation below.  The entire <blockquote> element
has dir="ltr" to work by default with RTL languages when the notice is
not translated, so if your language is RTL, you *must* put your
translation within <span dir="rtl">.-->
This is an unofficial translation of the GNU Free Documentation License
into <tt>language</tt>.  It was not published by the Free Software
Foundation, and does not legally state the distribution terms for
documentation that uses the GNU FDL&mdash;only the original English text
of the GNU FDL does that.  However, we hope that this translation will
help <tt>language</tt> speakers understand the GNU FDL better.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
If you make a translation, please inform the GNU Translation Managers
<a href="mailto:web-translators@gnu.org">&lt;web-translators@gnu.org&gt;</a>.
They will check to make sure that your translation follows the above
guidelines and make a link to it from this page.</p>

<p>
These are translations of version 1.2 of the FDL, which
is <em>not</em> the latest version.  Translations of current licenses
can be found <a href="/licenses/translations.html">here</a>.
