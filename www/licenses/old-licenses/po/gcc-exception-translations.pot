"The reason the FSF does not approve these translations as officially valid "
"is that checking them would be difficult and expensive (needing the help of "
"bilingual lawyers in other countries).  Even worse, if an error did slip "
"through, the results could be disastrous for the whole free software "
"community.  As long as the translations are unofficial, they can't do any "
"harm."

"The purpose of linking to translations is to help more people understand the "
"FDL.  In order for them to do that, translations need to be basically "
"accurate even if not perfect.  To produce a good translation, it is "
"essential to have fully understood fundamental concepts such as <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">copyleft</a> and the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software definition</a>.  For this "
"reason, those who wish to contribute translations should make sure they are "
"well acquainted with these concepts as well as other philosophical "
"principles that may appear in the document."
