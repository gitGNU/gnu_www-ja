      <p>The GNU Project (<a xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common"
      xmlns:suwl=
      "http://nwalsh.com/xslt/ext/com.nwalsh.saxon.UnwrapLinks"
      href="http://www.gnu.org/" target=
      "_top">http://www.gnu.org/</a>) writes, distributes, and
      promotes free software. The "free" in free software refers to
      liberty, not price: the freedom to use, modify, share, and
      improve the software. Free Software has many practical
      advantages over proprietary software but those are secondary
      benefits: GNU's rationale is <a xmlns:exsl=
      "http://exslt.org/common" xmlns:suwl=
      "http://nwalsh.com/xslt/ext/com.nwalsh.saxon.UnwrapLinks"

      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class=

      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class=
      "emphasis"><em>better</em></span> than tyranny.</p>

      <p><a xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common" xmlns:suwl=

      href="http://www.stallman.org/" target="_top">Richard
      Stallman</a> launched the GNU Project in <a xmlns:exsl=

      href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html"
      target="_top">1983</a> to develop a complete Unix-like
      operating system which is free software: the GNU system. (GNU
      is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced
      "guh-NEW".) In the years since the project began it has
      built, maintained and distributed some of the most important
      programs in use today: the GNU Compiler Collection (known as
      GCC), the GNU Debugger (known as GDB), the GNU C library, and
      the EMACS editor, among others. Along the way the project's
      scope grew and now GNU is much more than just a computer
      operating system: you can use GNU software to make telephone
      calls, design electronic circuits, write music, play chess,
      and many other things. There is currently no GNU software
      that can make toast, but that will likely change someday.</p>

      <p>The GNU Project is loosely organized, more like a republic
      than a monarchy. <a xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common"
      xmlns:suwl=

      href="http://www.stallman.org/" target="_top">Richard
      Stallman</a> is the project leader. Projects can choose to
      become GNU projects if they share the core GNU values, agree
      to follow the GNU standards, and fit into the GNU system. You
      can help GNU in many ways, but as a rule of thumb if you're
      helping the cause of Free Software then you're helping
      GNU.</p>

      <p>As we discussed in the introduction, the GNU project's
      motivation is ethical rather than practical. We believe that
      Free Software benefits society by preserving the freedoms of
      those who use it. Many people aren't as concerned about these
      issues and worry more about what's expedient for them. Often
      those people get frustrated when we hold to our principles
      rather than compromising them. That's why it's important that
      you take the time to learn about our beliefs (see our
      <a xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common" xmlns:suwl=
      "http://nwalsh.com/xslt/ext/com.nwalsh.saxon.UnwrapLinks"
      href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/" target=
      "_top">philosophy page</a>) and decide which of them you
      agree with. We're confident that once you learn about the
      solid ethical foundation that the GNU project rests on you'll
      want to help.</p>

      </div>

      <p>If you've learned about GNU and Free Software and would
      like to help us then the next question is: what would you
      like to do? You can help GNU in many ways; we need people to
      write documents such as books, reference guides and online
      info, we also need people to write software, do research, and
      many other tasks. Because of all of the different tasks at
      hand we are sure that you have skills that can help the GNU
      Project; you don't have to be an experienced software
      developer to help us. What skills and experience do you have?
      Do you have experience writing large and complex technical
      documents? Do you speak several human languages? Do you have
      a unique skill? Have you been a Unix hacker for 20 years or
      are you just learning? Obviously the answers to these
      questions will determine the sorts of jobs that you'll want
      to attempt to do. For example, if you've never written any
      documentation then you probably don't want to attempt to
      write a C++ STL tutorial or reference. If you have little
      mathematical expertise then you probably won't want to work
      on a statistical analysis package.</p>

      <p>There are many ways to help GNU. As Fred Brooks pointed
      out, there's much more to building successful software
      products than simply writing a computer program. Products
      need testing, documentation, and translations. Even the
      projects that build the products can use help, for example
      maintaining web pages or triaging bug reports. Here are a few
      common skill areas that are helpful, and resources to find
      out more about them:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Write code.</li>

          <li>Write Documentation. First, it's important that the
          GNU project be consistent. We can't have 40 different
          documentation formats floating around, therefore GNU
          documentation is written in a language called
          <a xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common" xmlns:suwl=
          "http://nwalsh.com/xslt/ext/com.nwalsh.saxon.UnwrapLinks"
          href=
          "http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/"
          target="_top">Texinfo</a>. Second, writing good
          documentation is a time-consuming exercise so we ask that
          people consider whether they're able to commit at least a
          few hours per week before getting involved in a large
          project (such as writing a new manual). If you find
          yourself unable to make such a commitment then we'd still
          appreciate your help in areas such as proofreading,
          though.</li>

          <li>Translate. There's a lot of translation to be done,
          and we'd appreciate your help. Please understand that
          it's more helpful to write new documentation than
          translate existing docs, but again we would appreciate
          any help that you can offer.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Once you've got an idea of what sort of task you'd like to
      do (at a high level at least) you should think about how much
      time you're ready to volunteer. Any amount is useful, but
      it's important that you don't allow yourself to "bite off
      more than you can chew". You need to be realistic about how
      much time you'll be able to spend so you don't overcommit
      yourself. That wouldn't good for you, the people in your
      life, or the project that you've committed to.</p>

      <p>How can you help given the amount of time that you'd like
      to donate? There are many roles to play within a project;
      naturally some consume more time than others. In order of
      increasing commitment:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>User. An easy and fun way to help GNU and Free
          Software is to use Free Software for all of your computer
          tasks.  By doing so you're joining a community of people
          who are living their beliefs.  Start by installing a
          <a href="/distros">GNU/Linux distribution</a>.
          Users can help in many important ways such as writing
          high-quality bug reports, making feature requests, and gathering
          functional requirements. Users provide important feedback to
          distribution maintainers.
	  </li>

          <li>Contributor. Many people want to help projects with
          code, documentation, packaging, etc but aren't ready to
          make the commitment (or don't have the experience) to be
          maintainers. Contributors make non-trivial commitments to
          the project but usually at a lower intensity than
          maintainers. Contributors can report bugs but will often
          fix the ones that they find, or at least investigate
          their causes.</li>

          <li>Maintainer. Maintainers are the project leaders, they
          commit substantial time, energy, and emotion to their
          projects. Typically a maintainer will be the ultimate
          arbiter of any design or coding issues that arise within
          the project. It's a prestigious title, but requires
          effort to earn and a substantial investment to keep.</li>

      </div>

      <p>Now that you've thought about how much time you'd like to
      contribute, and which roles might be right for you, it's time
      to find something to do! It's best to work on something that
      you use yourself, something that makes your life easier. If
      you followed our advice above and are using a GNU system then
      you've probably found a few things that you'd like to
      improve, a couple of features that you'd like to have, or
      even a bug or two. Great, jump in! Download the source code,
      fire up your favorite editor (we trust that it's EMACS) and
      start learning how the program is put together. When you feel
      ready, subscribe to the developer's mailing list for that
      project and ask how you can help. The project developers will
      probably have a list of tasks to work on. If you've thought
      of something yourself it's a good idea to check with the
      developers before spending too much time on it; someone else
      might already be working on the same thing and you don't want
      to waste your effort.</p>

      <p>If no project jumps out at you then you'll probably want
      to search for a project that needs help. Here are some places
      to look:</p>

      <p>Once you've found a project, how do you get involved? The
      best approach is to familiarize yourself with the project's
      work to date and then approach the project development team
      and offer your help. Download the software, build it and
      spend some time learning how it works and how the source code
      is structured. If you have questions you can ask the
      developers (preferably via the developers mailing lists) but
      please be respectful of their time.</p>

      <p>Many projects communicate using mailing lists, so you'll
      want to find the project's developer mailing list and
      subscribe to it. Different projects have different cultures
      so it's prudent to "lurk" on the list for a few days to learn
      the developers' style before diving in. When you're ready,
      send a message offering your help. If you have an idea to
      improve the program you might want to check with the
      developers to see if anyone else is working on something
      similar - if so you'll want to coordinate your efforts so you
      don't waste time. If you don't have a specific idea but want
      to help the project, say so and someone will suggest
      something to work on.</p>
