<p>We're often asked why we don't endorse a particular
system&mdash;usually a popular GNU/Linux distribution.  The short
answer to that question is that they don't follow
the <a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">free
system distribution guidelines</a>.  But since it isn't always easy to
see how a particular system fails to follow the guidelines, we still
get these questions.  We've published this list to help address
those.</p>

<p>To learn more about free alternatives to these systems, check out
our list of <a href="/distros/free-distros.html">free GNU/Linux
distributions</a>.</p>

<p>Except where noted, all of the distributions listed on this page
fail to follow the guidelines in at least two important ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They do not have a policy of <em>only</em> including free
software, and removing nonfree software if it is discovered.  Most of
them have no clear policy on what software they'll accept or reject at
all.  The distributions that do have a policy unfortunately aren't
strict enough, as explained below.</p></li>
<li><p>The kernel that they distribute (in most cases, Linux) includes
&ldquo;blobs&rdquo;: pieces of object code distributed without source,
usually firmware to run some device.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Below are additional notes about some popular GNU/Linux
distributions, listed in alphabetical order.  This may not be a list
of every issue; while we've done our best to be comprehensive, there
may be other issues that we simply don't know about.  On the flip
side, circumstances might have changed since we last updated this
page; if you think one of the issues here has been addressed,
please <a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">let us know</a>.  We review
all systems carefully before endorsing them.</p>

<!-- Please keep this list sorted, first with all the GNU systems 
     alphabetically, then all the non-GNU systems alphabetically. -->

<h3 id="Arch">Arch GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Arch has the two usual problems: there's no clear policy
about what software can be included, and nonfree blobs are shipped with
their kernel, Linux.  Arch also has no policy about not distributing
nonfree software through their normal channels.</p>

<h3 id="CentOS">CentOS</h3>

<p>We're not aware of problems in CentOS aside from the two usual ones:
there's no clear policy about what software can be included,
and nonfree blobs are shipped with Linux, the kernel.  Of course, with
no firm policy in place, there might be other nonfree software
included that we missed.</p>

<h3 id="Debian">Debian GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Debian's Social Contract states the goal of making Debian entirely
free software, and Debian conscientiously keeps nonfree software out
of the official Debian system.  However, Debian also provides a
repository of nonfree software.  According to the project, this
software is &ldquo;not part of the Debian system,&rdquo; but the
repository is hosted on many of the project's main servers, and people
can readily learn about these nonfree packages by browsing Debian's
online package database.  This does too much to steer users towards
proprietary software for us to endorse it.</p>

<p>There are other ways in which programs officially part of Debian
suggest nonfree software for installation.</p>

<p>Previous releases of Debian also included nonfree blobs with Linux, the
kernel.  With the release of Debian 6.0 (&ldquo;squeeze&rdquo;)
in February 2011, these blobs have been moved out of the main
distribution to separate packages in the nonfree repository.</p>

<h3 id="Fedora">Fedora</h3>

<p>Fedora does have a clear policy about what can be included in the
distribution, and it seems to be followed carefully.  The policy
requires that most software and all fonts be available under a free
license, but makes an exception for certain kinds of nonfree firmware.
Unfortunately, the decision to allow that firmware in the policy keeps
Fedora from meeting the free system distribution guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="Gentoo">Gentoo GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Gentoo makes it easy to install a number of nonfree programs through
their primary package system.</p>

<h3 id="Mandriva">Mandriva GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Mandriva does have a stated policy about what can be included in the
main system.  It's based on Fedora's, which means that it also allows
certain kinds of nonfree firmware to be included.  On top of that, it
permits software released under the original Artistic License to be
included, even though that's a nonfree license.</p>

<p>Mandriva also provides nonfree software through dedicated
repositories.</p>

<h3 id="openSUSE">openSUSE GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>openSUSE offers its users access to a repository of nonfree
software.  This is an instance of
how <a href="/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">
&ldquo;open&rdquo; is weaker than &ldquo;free&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h3 id="RedHat">Red Hat GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Red Hat's enterprise distribution primarily follows the same
licensing policies as Fedora, with one exception.  Thus, we don't
endorse it for <a href="#Fedora">the same reasons</a>.  In addition to
those, Red Hat has no policy against making nonfree software available
for the system through supplementary distribution channels.</p>

<h3 id="Slackware">Slackware</h3>

<p>Slackware has the two usual problems: there's no clear policy about
what software can be included, and nonfree blobs are included in
Linux, the kernel.  It also ships with the nonfree image-viewing
program xv.  Of course, with no firm policy in place, there might be
other nonfree software included that we missed.</p>

<h3 id="SUSE">SUSE GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>In addition to the usual two problems, several nonfree software
programs are available for download from SUSE's official FTP site.</p>

<h3 id="Ubuntu">Ubuntu GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Ubuntu provides specific repositories of nonfree software, and
Canonical expressly promotes and recommends nonfree software under the
Ubuntu name in some of their distribution channels.  Ubuntu offers the
option to install only free packages, which means it also offers the
option to install nonfree packages too.  In addition, the version of
Linux, the kernel, included in Ubuntu contains firmware blobs.</p>

<p>
Ubuntu's trademark policy prohibits commercial redistribution of exact
copies of Ubuntu, denying an important freedom.
</p>

<h3 id="BSD">BSD systems</h3>

<p>FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD all include instructions for obtaining
nonfree programs in their ports system.  In addition, their kernels
include nonfree firmware blobs.</p>

<p>Nonfree firmware programs used with Linux, the kernel, are called
&ldquo;blobs&rdquo;, and that's how we use the term.  In BSD parlance,
the term &ldquo;blob&rdquo; means something else: a nonfree driver.
OpenBSD and perhaps other BSD distributions have the policy of not
including those.  That is the right policy, as regards drivers; but
when the developers say these distributions &ldquo;contain no
blobs&rdquo;, it causes a misunderstanding.  They are not talking
about firmware blobs.</p>

<p>No BSD distribution has policies against proprietary binary-only
firmware that might be loaded even by free drivers.</p>

<h3 id="Haiku">Haiku</h3>

<p>Haiku includes some software that you're not allowed to modify.  It
also includes nonfree firmware blobs.</p>
