<p><em><span class="highlight">The <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free
Software Foundation</a> is not responsible for other web sites, or how
up-to-date their information is.</span></em></p> 
</blockquote>

<p>This page lists the <a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a>
distributions that are
entirely <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> as in freedom.
All of the distributions that follow are installable to a
computer's hard drive; most can be run live.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation recommends and endorses these GNU/Linux
distros, although we do not try to judge or compare them based on any
criterion other than freedom; therefore, we list them in alphabetical
order.  We encourage you to read these brief descriptions and to
consult their respective web sites and other information to choose the
one best for you.</p>

<p>These distros are ready-to-use full systems whose developers have made
a commitment to follow the 
<a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Guidelines
for Free System Distributions</a>.  This means these distros will
include, and propose, exclusively free software.  They will reject
nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers,
nonfree firmware &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;, nonfree games, and any other
nonfree software, as well as nonfree manuals or documentation.</p>

<p>If one of these distros ever does include or propose anything nonfree,
that must have happened by mistake, and the developers are committed to
removing it.  If you find nonfree software or documentation in one of
these distributions, you can
<a href="/help/gnu-bucks.html">report the problem, and earn GNU Bucks</a>, 
while we inform the developers so they can fix the problem.</p>

<p>Fixing freedom bugs is an ethical requirement for listing a distro
here; therefore, we list only distros with a development team that has
told us it will remove any nonfree software that might be found in
them.  Usually the team consists of volunteers, and they don't make
legally binding commitments to users; but if we find out a distro is
not properly maintained, we will de-list it.</p>

<p>We hope the other existing GNU/Linux distributions will become
entirely free software so that we can list them here.  If you wish to
improve the state of free distros, helping to develop an existing free
distro contributes more than starting a new one.</p>

<p><strong>All of the distributions that follow are installable to a
computer's hard drive; most can be run live.  Not all hardware works
in the free world; each distro's site should say which hardware it
supports.</strong></p>

<p>We endorse these distros only for freedom.  We do not try to judge
or compare these distros based on any other criterion; therefore, we
list them in alphabetical order.  We suggest you consult their
respective web sites and other information to judge which one is most
convenient for you.</p>

<!-- Do not add or remove anything from this list without a lot of
     discussion, following the usual process, and confirmation by RMS. See

<p id="small-distros">Below is a list of small system distributions. These 
   distributions are meant for devices with limited resources, like a 
   wireless router for example. A free small system distribution is not 
   self-hosting, but it must be developable and buildable on top of one of 
   the free complete systems listed above, perhaps with the aid of free 
   tools distributed alongside the small system distribution itself.</p>

<p>In addition to their own sites, many of these distributions are
available from <a href="http://mirror.fsf.org/">mirror.fsf.org</a>.
Feel free to download or mirror the distributions from there,
preferably using rsync.  Free distribution maintainers can request a
mirror for their project by mailing the 
<a href="mailto:sysadmin@fsf.org">FSF sysadmins</a>.</p>

<p id="other-free">Non-GNU-based free system distributions are
listed in <a href="/distros/free-non-gnu-distros.html">a separate file</a>.</p>

<p>We list <a href="/links/companies.html">companies that sell hardware
preinstalled with a free GNU/Linux distribution</a> separately.</p>

<p><a href="/software/software.html">Individual GNU
packages</a> (most of which are included in the free distributions here) 
are described separately.</p>

<h3 id="NewDistro">See something we missed?</h3>

<p>Do you know about a distribution that you expected to find on our
list, but didn't?  First, check our page
about <a href="/distros/common-distros.html">why we don't endorse some
common distributions</a>.  That page explains the reasons why several
well-known distributions don't
meet <a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">our
guidelines</a>.  If the distribution isn't listed there either, and
you think it qualifies for a listing under our guidelines, then please
let the distribution's maintainers know about this page and encourage
them to get in touch&mdash;we'd like to hear from them.</p>

<p>If you maintain a distribution that follows
the <a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Free
System Distribution Guidelines</a> and would like to be listed here,
please write to us
at <a href="mailto:licensing@fsf.org">&lt;licensing@fsf.org&gt;</a>
with an introduction and a link to the project Web site.  When you do,
we'll explain more about our evaluation process to you, and get
started on it quickly.  We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
