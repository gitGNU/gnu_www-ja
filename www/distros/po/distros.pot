"The developers of nonfree distros don't say, &ldquo;We apologize for the "

"possessed us to include them.  We hope that next release we will keep our "
"minds on freedom.&rdquo; If they did, they would have less of a bad "

"Instead, they generally present the nonfree software in their systems as a "
"positive feature; they say that their goal is &ldquo;the best possible user "
"experience&rdquo;, rather than freedom.  In other words, they convey a "
"message directly opposed to the free software movement's core goal."

"The fact that these distros don't deliver freedom is why we don't endorse "
"them.  That they teach people not to value freedom is why we are strongly "
