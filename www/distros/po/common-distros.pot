"We're often asked why we don't endorse a particular system&mdash;usually a "
"popular GNU/Linux distribution.  The short answer to that question is that "
"they don't follow the <a "
"href=\"/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html\">free system "
"distribution guidelines</a>.  But since it isn't always obvious how a "
"particular system fails to follow the guidelines, this list gives more "

"Debian's Social Contract states the goal of making Debian entirely free "

"nonfree software.  According to the project, this software is &ldquo;not "
