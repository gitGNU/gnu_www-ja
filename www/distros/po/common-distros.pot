"We're often asked why we don't endorse a particular system&mdash;usually a "
"popular GNU/Linux distribution.  The short answer to that question is that "
"they don't follow the <a "
"href=\"/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html\">free system "
"distribution guidelines</a>.  But since it isn't always obvious how a "
"particular system fails to follow the guidelines, this list gives more "
"information about the problems of certain well-known nonfree system distros."

"Debian's Social Contract states the goal of making Debian entirely free "

"official Debian system.  However, Debian also provides a repository of "
"nonfree software.  According to the project, this software is &ldquo;not "

"the project's main servers, and people can readily learn about these nonfree "
"packages by browsing Debian's online package database."

"Previous releases of Debian included nonfree blobs with Linux, the kernel.  "
"With the release of Debian 6.0 (&ldquo;squeeze&rdquo;) in February 2011, "
"these blobs have been moved out of the main distribution to separate "
"packages in the nonfree repository.  However, the problem partly remains: "
