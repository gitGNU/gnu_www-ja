"We're often asked why we don't endorse a particular system&mdash;usually a "
"popular GNU/Linux distribution.  The short answer to that question is that "
"they don't follow the <a href=\"/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines."
"html\">free system distribution guidelines</a>.  But since it isn't always "
"easy to see how a particular system fails to follow the guidelines, we still "

"Debian's Social Contract states the goal of making Debian entirely free "

"part of the Debian system,&rdquo; but the repository is hosted on many of "
"the project's main servers, and people can readily learn about these nonfree "
