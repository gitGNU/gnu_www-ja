<h2>Free GNU/Linux distributions</h2>

<p><em><span class="highlight">The FSF is not responsible for other
web sites, or how up-to-date their information is.</span></em></p>

<p>Below are the complete,
ready-to-use <a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a>
distributions we know follow
the <a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Guidelines
for Free System Distributions</a>.  They have a firm policy commitment
to only include and only propose free software.  They reject non-free
applications, non-free programming platforms, non-free drivers, or
non-free firmware &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;.  If by mistake they do include
any, they remove it.  If you have found such non-free software or
documentation in one of these distributions, you can
<a href="/help/gnu-bucks.html">report the issue and earn GNU
Bucks</a>.</p>

<p>Other distributions are making efforts to move toward a completely
free system.  We thank them for their ongoing work to achieve that goal,
and hope to list them here some day.</p>

<p><strong>All of the distributions that follow are installable to a
computer's hard drive and most can be run live.</strong></p>

<p>We cannot make a general recommendation for using one over another,
so they are listed here in alphabetical order.  We encourage you to read
these brief descriptions and even more to explore their respective web
sites and other information to choose the one best for you.</p>

<!-- Please notify webmasters@gnu.org when adding a new distro here; and
     do not do so without a lot of discussion and confirmation by rms.  -->

<p>In addition to their own sites, many of these distributions are
available from <a href="http://mirror.fsf.org/">mirror.fsf.org</a>.
Feel free to download or mirror the distributions from there,
preferably using rsync.  Free distribution maintainers can request a
mirror for their project by mailing
the <a href="mailto:sysadmin@fsf.org">FSF sysadmins</a>.</p>

<p>We list <a href="/links/companies.html">companies that sell hardware
preinstalled with a free GNU/Linux distribution</a> separately.</p>

<p><a href="/software/software.html">Individual GNU
packages</a> (most of which are included in the free distributions here) 
are described separately.</p>

<h3 id="NewDistro">See something we missed?</h3>

<p>Do you know about a distribution that you expected to find on our
list, but didn't?  First, check our page
about <a href="/distros/common-distros.html">why we don't endorse some
common distributions</a>.  That page explains the reasons why several
well-known distributions don't
meet <a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">our
guidelines</a>.  If the distribution isn't listed there either, and
you think it qualifies for a listing under our guidelines, then please
let the distribution's maintainers know about this page and encourage
them to get in touch&mdash;we'd like to hear from them.</p>

<p>If you maintain a distribution that follows
the <a href="/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Free
System Distribution Guidelines</a> and would like to be listed here,
please write to us
at <a href="mailto:webmasters@gnu.org">&lt;webmasters@gnu.org&gt;</a>
with an introduction and a link to the project Web site.  When you do,
we'll explain more about our evaluation process to you, and get
started on it quickly.  We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
