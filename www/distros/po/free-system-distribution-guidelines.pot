"The purpose of these guidelines is to explain what it means for an "
"installable system distribution (such as a GNU/Linux distribution) to "
"qualify as <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free</a> (libre), and help "
"distribution developers make their distributions qualify."

"These guidelines are not complete.  We have mentioned the issues we are "

msgid ""
"Our list of distributions is a guide for systems you can install in a "
"computer.  Therefore, it only includes distributions that are complete in "
"themselves and ready to use.  If a distribution is incomplete &mdash; if it "
"requires further development, or presupposes installing other software as "
"well &mdash; then it is not listed here, even if it is free software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "License Rules"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"&ldquo;Information for practical use&rdquo; includes software, "
"documentation, fonts, and other data that has direct functional "
"applications.  It does not include artistic works that have an aesthetic "
"(rather than functional) purpose, or statements of opinion or judgment."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"All information for practical use in a free distribution must be available "
"in source form.  (&ldquo;Source&rdquo; means the form of the information "
"that is preferred for making changes to it.)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The information, and the source, must be provided under an appropriate free "
"license.  We list the ones we have evaluated on <a class=\"reference\" "
"href=\"/licenses/license-list.html\">our license list</a>, with separate "
"sections for licenses that are suitable for software, documentation, fonts, "
"and other useful works.  If such a work is released under multiple licenses, "
"at least one of which is free, it can be included in the system; the system "
"developers just need to follow the terms of the available free license(s) "
"when they distribute and/or modify it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"A free system distribution must not steer users towards obtaining any "
"nonfree information for practical use, or encourage them to do so.  The "
"system should have no repositories for nonfree software and no specific "
"recipes for installation of particular nonfree programs. Nor should the "
"distribution refer to third-party repositories that are not committed to "
"only including free software; even if they only have free software today, "
"that may not be true tomorrow.  Programs in the system should not suggest "
"installing nonfree plugins, documentation, and so on."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"A free system distribution should be self-hosting.  This means that you must "
"be able to develop and build the system with tools that the system provides "
"you.  As a result, a free system distribution cannot include free software "
"that can only be built by using nonfree software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"There's a lot of code in most free system distributions today; the amount of "
"effort it would take to audit it all directly is impractical for most "
"teams.  In the past, some nonfree code has accidentally been included in "
"free system distributions.  We don't de-list distributions because of this; "
"instead, we only ask that a distribution's developers make a good faith "
"effort to avoid including nonfree software, and commit themselves to "
"removing such programs if any are discovered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Certain kinds of license situations merit special attention for people "
"creating or considering free software distributions; those are discussed in "
"the sections below."

msgid "Nonfree Firmware"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Some applications and drivers require firmware to function, and sometimes "
"that firmware is distributed only in object code form, under a nonfree "
"license.  We call these firmware programs &ldquo;blobs.&rdquo; On most "
"GNU/Linux systems, you'll typically find these accompanying some drivers in "
"the kernel Linux.  Such firmware should be removed from a free system "
"distribution."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Blobs can take many forms.  Sometimes, they will be provided in separate "
"files.  Other times, they may be incorporated into the source of the driver "
"itself&mdash;for example, it could be encoded as a large array of numbers.  "
"But no matter how it's encoded, any nonfree firmware needs to be removed "
"from a free system."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"(To be clear, not every array of numbers in a driver is firmware.  It's "
"important to understand the purpose of the data before deciding whether or "
"not it's appropriate for a free system.)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Brian Brazil, Jeff Moe, and Alexandre Oliva have developed a series of <a "
"class=\"reference\" "
"href=\"http://www.fsfla.org/svn/fsfla/software/linux-libre/scripts/\">scripts "
"to remove nonfree firmware</a> from a stock version of the Linux kernel.  "
"You may find them helpful if you would like to develop your own free "
"GNU/Linux distribution&mdash;although we recommend joining development of an "
"existing free distro rather than fragmenting effort by starting a new one.  "
"The complete source for a blob-free version of the Linux kernel is also "
"available; you can learn more about this project from the <a "
"class=\"reference\" href=\"http://directory.fsf.org/project/linux/\">Free "
"Software Directory</a>."

msgid "Non-functional Data"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Data that isn't functional, that doesn't do a practical job, is more of an "
"adornment to the system's software than a part of it.  Thus, we don't insist "
"on the free license criteria for non-functional data.  It can be included in "
"a free system distribution as long as its license gives you permission to "
"copy and redistribute, both for commercial and non-commercial purposes.  For "
"example, some game engines released under the GNU GPL have accompanying game "
"information&mdash;a fictional world map, game graphics, and so "
"on&mdash;released under such a verbatim-distribution license.  This kind of "
"data can be part of a free system distribution, even though its license does "
"not qualify as free, because it is non-functional."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Trademarks"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Trademarks are associated with some software.  For example, the name of a "
"program may be trademarked, or its interface may display a trademarked "
"logo.  Often, the use of these marks will be controlled in some way; in "
"particular, developers are commonly asked to remove references to the "
"trademark from the software when they modify it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In extreme cases, these restrictions may effectively render the program "
"nonfree.  It is unfair for someone to ask you to remove a trademark from "
"modified code if that trademark is scattered all throughout the original "
"source.  As long as the practical requirements are reasonable, however, free "
"system distributions may include these programs, either with or without the "
"trademarks."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Similarly, the distribution itself may hold particular trademarks.  It is "
"not a problem if modification requires removal of these trademarks, as long "
"as they can readily be removed without losing functionality."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"However, it is unacceptable to use trademarks to restrict verbatim copying "
"and redistribution of the whole distribution, or any part."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Documentation"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"All the documentation in a free system distribution must be released under "
"an appropriate free license.  Additionally, it must take care not to "
"recommend nonfree software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In general, something that helps people who already use nonfree software to "
"use the free software better with it is acceptable, but something that "
"encourages users of the free software to install nonfree software is not."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For example, a free system distribution may have documentation for users "
"setting up dual boot systems.  It could explain how to access filesystems of "
"the proprietary operating system, import settings from it, and so on.  That "
"would be helping people install a free system distribution on a machine "
"which already has proprietary software, which is good."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"What would be unacceptable is for the documentation to give people "
"instructions for installing a nonfree program on the system, or mention "
"conveniences they might gain by doing so."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For a borderline case, a clear and serious exhortation not to use the "
"nonfree program would move it to the acceptable side of the line."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Patents"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"It is effectively impossible for free software developers and distributors "
"to know whether or not a given piece of software infringes any patents: "
"there are too many of them, they vary from country to country, they're often "
"worded so as to make it hard to tell what they do or don't cover, and it "
"isn't easy to tell which ones are valid.  Therefore, we don't generally ask "
"free system distributions to exclude software because of possible threats "
"from patents.  On the other hand, we also don't object if a distributor "
"chooses to omit some software in order to avoid patent risk."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "No Malware"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid "The distro must contain no DRM, no back doors, and no spyware."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Commitment to Correct Mistakes"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Most distribution development teams don't have the resources to exhaustively "
"check that their distribution meet all these criteria.  Neither do we.  So "
"we expect distros to occasionally contain mistakes: nonfree software that "
"slipped through, etc.  We don't reject a distribution over mistakes.  Our "
"requirement is for the distribution developers to have a firm commitment to "
"promptly correct any mistakes that are reported to them."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Maintenance"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"To be listed, a distribution should be actively maintained, and should give "
"the GNU Project a clear and specific way to report problems of nonfree "
"software that we find out about.  It should also inform us when the problems "
"we have reported are fixed."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Name Confusion"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"We will not list a distribution whose name makes confusion with nonfree "
"distributions likely.  For example, if Foobar Light is a free distribution "
"and Foobar is a nonfree distribution, we will not list Foobar Light.  This "
"is because we expect that the distinction between the two would be lost in "
"the process of communicating the message."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Contacting Upstream If You're Downstream"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For distro developers (or anyone else) who have sent an important bug report "
"for a GNU package: if it has gone unheeded by the package maintainer after a "
"reasonable time (please allow at least two weeks), you can escalate the bug "
"by writing to &lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;.  This is especially warranted if "
"you can't find evidence of recent activity by the package maintainer."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <h3>
msgid "Please Teach Users about Free Software"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"To establish lasting freedom, just giving users freedom isn't sufficient.  "
"It is necessary also to teach them to understand what it means and to demand "
"it.  Thus, we suggest and urge that free distros announce prominently on the "
"screen, before login and on the default desktop after login, a prominent "
"statement about freedom, such as &ldquo;This system is freedom-respecting "
"free/libre software&rdquo; or something comparable, and to present a link or "
"icon pointing at gnu.org or gnu.org/philosophy for further information about "
"the issue."

"We maintain a list of the <a href=\"/distros/free-distros.html\">free system "

"Our list consists of systems based on GNU which acknowledge that they are "
