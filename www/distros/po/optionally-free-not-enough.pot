"There are distros we decline to recommend that offer the user the option of "
"installing only free software.  Given that option, a user who values freedom "
"strongly enough, and thinks about the issue, can make those distros respect "
"her freedom."

"A distro that offers that option is clearly better than one that fails to "
"offer that option.  But that option does not make the distro ok to recommend "
"in general.  After all, most people in our community are not conscious of "
"this issue.  We cannot expect most of them to reject nonfree software just "
"because the distro offers a way to do so."

"So if we are considering whether to recommend a distro, we need to consider "
"who we would recommend it to.  For instance, it could be:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid ""
"Specific committed free software supporters that we know will make an effort "
"to avoid nonfree software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid "A large group such as perhaps the general public."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"For the first case, we could recommend the distro if the distro provides a "
"clear and reliable way to reject nonfree software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"However, for recommending a distro to the general public, we need to insist "
"on the criteria we actually use: an explicit commitment not to offer or "
"suggest any nonfree programs.  That way, we know the distro won't lead the "
"public to install any of those."
