<h2>Malware in Games</h2>

malware</a></p>

<p>
<em>Malware</em> means software designed to function in ways that
mistreat or harm the user.  (This does not include accidental errors.)
</p>

<p>
Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The difference
between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and
nonfree software is in <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware, because
the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any
malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.

<p>Here are examples of malware in games.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>nVidia's proprietary GeForce Experience <a href="http://www.gamersnexus.net/industry/2672-geforce-experience-data-transfer-analysis">makes
    users identify themselves and then sends personal data about them to
    nVidia servers</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Modern gratis game cr&hellip;apps
    <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2015/09/16/we-own-you-confessions-of-a-free-to-play-producer/">
    collect a wide range of data about their users and their users' 
    friends and associates</a>.</p>

    <p>Even nastier, they do it through ad networks that merge the data
    collected by various cr&hellip;apps and sites made by different 
    companies.</p>

    <p>They use this data to manipulate people to buy things, and hunt 
    for &ldquo;whales&rdquo; who can be led to spend a lot of money. They 
    also use a back door to manipulate the game play for specific players.</p>

    <p>While the article describes gratis games, games that cost money 
    can use the same tactics.</p>

<p>Oculus Rift games now have

DRM meant to prevent running them on other systems</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Some proprietary <a
