<p>
<em>Malware</em> means software designed to function in ways that
mistreat or harm the user.  (This does not include accidental errors.)
</p>

<p>
Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The difference
between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and
nonfree software is in <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware, because
the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any
malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.
</p>

<p>Here are examples of malware in appliances.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>More or less all &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TVs <a href="
  http://www.myce.com/news/reseachers-all-smart-tvs-spy-on-you-sony-monitors-all-channel-switches-72851/">spy
  on their users</a>.</p>

<p>The report was as of 2014, but we don't expect this has got
better.</p>

<p>This shows that laws requiring products to get users' formal
consent before collecting personal data are totally inadequate.  And
what happens if a user declines consent?  Probably the TV will say,
&ldquo;Without your consent to tracking, the TV will not
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Proper laws would say that TVs are not allowed to report what the
user watches &mdash; no exceptions!</p>

Samsung &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; TVs have turned Linux into the base
for a tyrant system</a> so as to impose DRM.
What enables Samsung to do this is that Linux is released under
GNU GPL version 2, <a href="/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html">not version 3</a>,
together with a weak interpretation of GPL version 2.

people use it</a>.</p>

<p>The company's statement that it anonymizes the data may be true,
but it doesn't really matter. If it sells the data to a data broker,
the data broker can figure out who the user is.</p>

remote login access</a> to them.  HP claims that this does not give HP
access to the customer's data, but if the back door allows
installation of software changes, a change could be installed that
would give access to the customer's data.

Volkswagen programmed its car engine computers to detect the
Environmental Protection Agency's emission tests</a>,
and run dirty the rest of the time.</p>

<p>In real driving, the cars exceeded emissions standards by a factor
of up to 35.</p>

<p>Using free software would not have stopped Volkswagen from

<p>The <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/post/137045828005/free-the-cube">
&ldquo;Cube&rdquo; 3D printer was designed with DRM</a>: it won't accept
third-party printing materials.  It is the Keurig of printers.  Now it is
being discontinued, which means that eventually authorized materials won't
be available and the printers may become unusable.</p>

<p>With a <a href="http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/aleph-objects">
printer that gets the Respects Your Freedom</a>, this problem would not
even be a remote possibility.</p>

<p>How pitiful that the author of that article says that there was
&ldquo;nothing wrong&rdquo; with designing the device to restrict users in
the first place.  This is like putting a &ldquo;cheat me and mistreat me&rdquo;
sign on your chest.  We should know better: we should condemn all companies
that take advantage of people like him.  Indeed, it is the acceptance of
their unjust practice that teaches people to be doormats.</p>

<p>Over 70 brands of network-connected surveillance cameras have <a

<p>Samsung's &ldquo;Smart Home&rdquo; has a big security hole; <a
href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/samsung-smart-home-flaws-lets-hackers-make-keys-to-front-door/">
unauthorized people can remotely control it</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung claims that this is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; platform so the
problem is partly the fault of app developers. That is clearly true if
the apps are proprietary software.</p>

<p>Anything whose name is &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; is most likely going to
screw you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Nissan Leaf has a built-in cell phone modem which allows
effectively anyone to <a
href="https://www.troyhunt.com/controlling-vehicle-features-of-nissan/">
access its computers remotely and make changes in various
settings</a>.</p>

<p>That's easy to do because the system has no authentication when
accessed through the modem.  However, even if it asked for
authentication, you couldn't be confident that Nissan has no
access.  The software in the car is
proprietary, <a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">which
means it demands blind faith from its users</a>.</p>

<p>Even if no one connects to the car remotely, the cell phone modem
enables the phone company to track the car's movements all the time;
it is possible to physically remove the cell phone modem though.</p>

<p>Security researchers discovered a <a

<p>They could track the car, start or stop the engine, and
activate or deactivate the brakes, and more.</p>

<p>I expect that Chrysler and the NSA can do this too.</p>

available to car manufacturers, insurance companies, and others.</p>

<p>The case of toll-collection systems, mentioned in this article, is not
really a matter of proprietary surveillance.  These systems are an
intolerable invasion of privacy, and should be replaced with anonymous
payment systems, but the invasion isn't done by malware.  The other

Section 2, paragraphs b and c.</a>).  The company says it doesn't
store this information, but if the state orders it to get the data and
hand it over, the state can store it.</p>

<p>Vizio goes a step further than other TV manufacturers in spying on 
their users: their <a
href="http://www.propublica.org/article/own-a-vizio-smart-tv-its-watching-you">
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; TVs analyze your viewing habits in detail and 
link them your IP address</a> so that advertisers can track you 
across devices.</p>

<p>It is possible to turn this off, but having it enabled by default
is an injustice already.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Tivo's alliance with Viacom adds 2.3 million households to the 600
millions social media profiles the company already monitors.  Tivo
customers are unaware they're being watched by advertisers.  By
combining TV viewing information with online social media
participation, Tivo can now <a
href="http://www.reuters.com/article/viacom-tivo-idUSL1N12U1VV20151102">
correlate TV advertisement with online purchases</a>, exposing all
users to new combined surveillance by default.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some web and TV advertisements play inaudible sounds to be picked
up by proprietary malware running on other devices in range so as to
determine that they are nearby.  Once your Internet devices are paired
with your TV, advertisers can correlate ads with Web activity, and
