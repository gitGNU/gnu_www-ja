<h2>Proprietary Subscriptions</h2>

<p><a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a></p>

<p>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to
mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers,
which puts them in a position of power over the users; <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">that is the
basic injustice</a>. The developers often exercise that power to the
detriment of the users they ought to serve.</p>

<p>It sounds simple to say that a certain program &ldquo;requires a
subscription.&rdquo;  What that means concretely is that it contains a
time bomb, so that it will refuse to operate after that date.  Or else
it is <a href="/proprietary/proprietary-tethers.html">tethered to a
server</a>, and that server checks the date.  Either one is a
malicious functionality.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a
href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/adobe-software-subscription-model-means-you-cant-own-your-software/">
Adobe tools require a subscription</a>.  Adobe also tried to <a
href="http://chocolateandvodka.com/2014/02/20/adobe-creative-cloud-subscription-warning/">
rip people off by making the subscriptions annual</a>,
but that is a secondary issue compared with the basic wrong of the
time bomb.  When a program proprietary, and even malware, don't get
distracted by the secondary issues like price.</p>

<p>Please don't repeat the marketing term &ldquo;Creative Cloud&rdquo;
except to express revulsion for it.  The <a
href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#CloudComputing"> term
&ldquo;cloud&rdquo; is designed to cloud users' minds</a>.</p>
