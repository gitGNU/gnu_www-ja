<h2>Proprietary Insecurity</h2>

<a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to
mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers,
which puts them in a position of power over the users; <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">that is the
basic injustice</a>. The developers often exercise that power to the
detriment of the users they ought to serve.</p>

<p>This page lists clearly established cases of insecurity in
proprietary software that has grave consequences or is otherwise
noteworthy.</p>

<p>It would be incorrect to compare proprietary software with a
fictitious idea of free software as perfect.  Every nontrivial program
has bugs, and any system, free or proprietary, may have security
holes.  That in itself is not culpable.  But proprietary software
developers frequently disregard gaping holes, or even introduce them
deliberately, and <em>the users are helpless to fix them</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to weak security, <a href="http://jalopnik.com/almost-every-volkswagen-built-since-1995-is-vulnerable-1785159844">it
is easy to open the doors of 100 million cars built by Volkswagen</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ransomware <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/thermostat-ransomware-a-lesson-in-iot-security/">has
been developed for a thermostat that uses proprietary software</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-attack-can-steal-your-username-password-and-other-logins/">flaw in
Internet Explorer and Edge</a> allows an attacker to retrieve
Microsoft account credentials, if the user is tricked into visiting a
malicious link.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/29/research-shows-deleted-whatsapp-messages-arent-actually-deleted/">&ldquo;Deleted&rdquo;
WhatsApp messages are not entirely deleted</a>. They can be recovered
in various ways.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A vulnerability in Apple's Image I/O API allowed an attacker to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/22/stagefright-flaw-ios-iphone-imessage-apple">execute
  malacious code from any application which uses this API to render a
  certain kind of image file</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in a proprietary ASN.1 library, used in cell phone towers as
well as cell phones and
routers, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/07/software-flaw-puts-mobile-phones-and-networks-at-risk-of-complete-takeover">allows
taking control of those systems</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Antivirus programs have so many errors
  that <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-more-vulnerabilities-are-discovered-is-it-time-to-uninstall-antivirus-software-61374">they
  may make security worse</a>.</p>
<p>GNU/Linux does not need antivirus software.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Over 70 brands of network-connected surveillance
cameras <a href="http://www.kerneronsec.com/2016/02/remote-code-execution-in-cctv-dvrs-of.html">have
security bugs that allow anyone to watch through them</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Samsung's &ldquo;Smart Home&rdquo; has a big security
hole; <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/samsung-smart-home-flaws-lets-hackers-make-keys-to-front-door/">unauthorized
people can remotely control it</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung claims that this is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; platform so the
problem is partly the fault of app developers. That is clearly true if
the apps are proprietary software.</p>

<p>Anything whose name is &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; is most likely going to
screw you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Nissan Leaf has a built-in cell phone modem which allows
effectively
anyone <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/controlling-vehicle-features-of-nissan/">to
access its computers remotely and make changes in various
settings</a>.</p>

<p>That's easy to do because the system has no authentication when
accessed through the modem.  However, even if it asked for
authentication, you couldn't be confident that Nissan has no
access.  The software in the car is
proprietary, <a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">which
means it demands blind faith from its users</a>.</p>

<p>Even if no one connects to the car remotely, the cell phone modem
enables the phone company to track the car's movements all the time;
it is possible to physically remove the cell phone modem though.</p>

<p>
Malware found
on <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/04/11/security_cameras_sold_through_amazon_have_malware_according_to_security.html">security
cameras available through Amazon</a>.
</p>

<p>A camera that records locally on physical media, and has no network
  connection, does not threaten people with surveillance&mdash;neither by
  watching people through the camera, nor through malware in the camera.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A bug in the iThings Messages
app <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/04/12/apple-bug-exposed-chat-history-with-a-single-click/">allowed
a malicious web site to extract all the user's messaging history</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Many proprietary payment apps <a
href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-10/many-mobile-payments-startups-aren-t-properly-securing-user-data">
transmit personal data in an insecure way</a>.
However, the worse aspect of these apps is that
<a href="/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">payment is not anonymous</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
FitBit fitness trackers <a href="http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/10-second-hack-delivers-first-ever-malware-to-fitness-trackers/">
have a Bluetooth vulnerability</a> that allows
attackers to send malware to the devices, which can subsequently spread
to computers and other FitBit trackers that interact with them.

&ldquo;Self-encrypting&rdquo; disk drives do the encryption with proprietary
firmware so you can't trust it. Western Digital's &ldquo;My Passport&rdquo;
drives
<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/some-popular-self-encrypting-hard-drives-have-really-bad-encryption">have a back door</a>.

<p>
Mac OS X had an
<a href="https://truesecdev.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/hidden-backdoor-api-to-root-privileges-in-apple-os-x/">
intentional local back door for 4 years</a>, which could be
exploited by attackers to gain root privileges.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Security researchers discovered a
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/12/hack-car-brakes-sms-text">
vulnerability in diagnostic dongles used for vehicle tracking and
insurance</a> that let them take remote control of a car or
lorry using an SMS.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Crackers were able to
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/fiat-chrysler-connected-car-bug-lets-hackers-take-over-jeep-remotely/">take remote control of the Jeep</a>
&ldquo;connected car&rdquo;.
<br/>They could track the car, start or stop the engine, and
activate or deactivate the brakes, and more.
</p>
<p>
I expect that Chrysler and the NSA can do this too.
</p>
<p>
If I ever own a car, and it contains a portable phone, I will
deactivate that.

Hospira infusion pumps, which are used to administer drugs to
a patient, were rated
&ldquo;<a
href="https://securityledger.com/2015/05/researcher-drug-pump-the-least-secure-ip-device-ive-ever-seen/">least
secure IP device I've ever seen</a>&rdquo;
by a security researcher.
</p>
<p>
Depending on what drug is being infused, the insecurity could
open the door to murder.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Due to bad security in a drug pump, crackers could use it to
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/hackers-can-send-fatal-doses-hospital-drug-pumps/">kill patients</a>.

The NSA can tap data in smart phones, including iPhones, Android, and
BlackBerry</a>.  While there is not much detail here, it seems that
this does not operate via the universal back door that we know nearly
all portable phones have.  It may involve exploiting various bugs.
There
are <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone">
lots of bugs in the phones' radio software</a>.

<p>An app to prevent &ldquo;identity theft&rdquo; (access to personal data)
by storing users' data on a special server
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/id-theft-protector-lifelock-deletes-user-data-over-concerns-that-app-isnt-safe/">was
deactivated by its developer</a> which had discovered a security flaw.
</p>

<p>
That developer seems to be conscientious about protecting personal
data from third parties in general, but it can't protect that data
from the state.  Quite the contrary: confiding your data to someone
else's server, if not first encrypted by you with free software,
undermines your rights.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554"> Some flash
memories have modifiable software</a>, which makes them vulnerable to
viruses.</p>

<p>We don't call this a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; because it is normal
that you can install a new system in a computer given physical access
to it.  However, memory sticks and cards should not be modifiable in
this way.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;page=6"> Replaceable
nonfree software in disk drives can be written by a nonfree
program.</a>  This makes any system vulnerable to persistent attacks
that normal forensics won't detect.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-05-app-vulnerability-threatens-millions-users.html">
Many smartphone apps use insecure authentication methods when storing
your personal data on remote servers.</a>
This leaves personal information like email addresses, passwords, and health information vulnerable. Because many
of these apps are proprietary it makes it hard to impossible to know which apps are at risk.</p>
