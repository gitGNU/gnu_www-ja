"software is in <a "

"users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's not directly a "
"question of what the program <em>does</em> when it runs.  However, in "
"practice nonfree software is often malware, because the developer's "
"awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any malicious "
"functionalities tempts the developer to impose some."
