<h2>Apple's Operating Systems Are Malware</h2>

<div class="highlight-para">
<p>
<em>Malware</em> means software designed to function in ways that
mistreat or harm the user.  (This does not include accidental errors.)
This page explains how the software in Apple's computer products are
malware.
</p>

<p>
Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The difference
between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and
nonfree software is in
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware,
because the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix
any malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.
</p>

<p>Here's how Apple's systems are malware.</p>

<h3 id="back-doors">Apple Back Doors</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
Mac OS X had an
<a href="https://truesecdev.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/hidden-backdoor-api-to-root-privileges-in-apple-os-x/">
intentional local back door for 4 years</a>, which could be
exploited by attackers to gain root privileges.
</p></li>

<li><p>The iPhone has a back door <a
href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358134/Apples-Jobs-confirms-iPhone-kill-switch.html">
that allows Apple to remotely delete apps</a> which Apple considers
&ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;. Jobs said it's OK for Apple to have this
power because of course we can trust Apple.
</p></li>

<li><p>The iPhone has a back door for <a
href="http://www.npr.org/2010/11/22/131511381/wipeout-when-your-company-kills-your-iphone">
remote wipe</a>.  It's not always enabled, but users are led into
enabling it without understanding.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="censorship">Apple Censorship</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
Apple <a href="http://ifixit.org/blog/7401/ifixit-app-pulled/">
banned a program from the App Store</a> because its developers
committed the enormity of disassembling some iThings.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Apple rejected an app that displayed the locations of US drone
assassinations, giving various excuses. Each time the developers
fixed one &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, Apple complained about another.
After the fifth rejection,
Apple <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/02/07/apple-app-tracks-drone-strikes/">admitted
it was censoring the app based on the subject matter</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
As of 2015, Apple <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/apple-anti-choice-tendencies-showing-in-app-store-reproductive-rights">systematically bans apps that endorse abortion
rights or would help women find abortions</a>.</p>

<p>
This particular political slant <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/siri-abortion-apple-unintenional-omissions">
affects other Apple services</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pressuring">Apple Pressuring</h3>

<p>Proprietary companies can take advantage of their customers by imposing arbitrary limits to their use of the software.  This section reports examples of hard sell and other unjust commercial tactics by Apple.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Apple Siri
      <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/apple-music-subscribers-siri-questions">refuses to give you information</a>
      about music charts if you're not an Apple Music subscriber.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sabotage">Apple Sabotage</h3>

<p>The wrongs in this section are not precisely malware, since they do
not involve making the program that runs in a way that hurts the user.
But they are a lot like malware, since they are technical Apple
actions that harm to the users of specific Apple software.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2541250/apple-mac/update--apple-plays-hardball--upgrade--bricks--unlocked-iphones.html">
  An Apple firmware &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; bricked iPhones that had been
  unlocked.</a>  The &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; also deactivated applications
  not approved by <a href="/philosophy/proprietary-jails.html">Apple
  censorship</a>.  All this was apparently intentional.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Apple
  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/04/apple-deleted-music-ipods-rivals-steve-jobs">
  deleted from iPods the music that users had got from internet music
  stores that competed with iTunes</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="surveillance">Apple Surveillance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>iThings automatically upload to Apple's servers all the photos and
      videos they make.</p>

    <blockquote><p>
      iCloud Photo Library stores every photo and video you take,
      and keeps them up to date on all your devices.
      Any edits you make are automatically updated everywhere. [...]
    </p></blockquote>

    <p>(From <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/photos/">Apple's iCloud
      information</a> as accessed on 24 Sep 2015.) The iCloud feature is
      <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202033">activated by the
      startup of iOS</a>. The term &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; means
      &ldquo;please don't ask where.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There is a way to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104">
      deactivate iCloud</a>, but it's active by default so it still counts as a
      surveillance functionality.</p>

    <p>Unknown people apparently took advantage of this to
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/01/naked-celebrity-hack-icloud-backup-jennifer-lawrence">get
      nude photos of many celebrities</a>. They needed to break Apple's
      security to get at them, but NSA can access any of them through
      <a href="/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html#digitalcash">PRISM</a>.
  </p></li>

  MacOS automatically sends to Apple servers unsaved documents being

  things you have not decided to save are even more sensitive than the
  things you have stored in files</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Apple has made various
  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/04/apple-data-privacy-icloud">
  MacOS programs send files to Apple servers without asking permission</a>.
  This exposes the files to Big Brother and perhaps to other snoops.</p>

  <p>It also demonstrates how you can't trust proprietary software,
  because even if today's version doesn't have a malicious
  functionality, tomorrow's version might add it. The developer won't
  remove the malfeature unless many users push back hard, and the users
  can't remove it themselves.</p>

  more snooping that Apple has not talked about</a>.</p>

<h3 id="drm">Apple DRM</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><a
  href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/11/apple-downgrades-macbook-video-drm">
  DRM (digital restrictions mechanisms) in MacOS</a>. This article
  focuses on the fact that a new model of Macbook introduced a requirement
  for monitors to have malicious hardware, but DRM software in MacOS is
  involved in activating the hardware. The software for accessing iTunes
  is also responsible.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/08/aacs-tentacles/">
  DRM that caters to Bluray disks</a>.  (The article focused on Windows
  and said that MacOS would do the same thing subsequently.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jails">Apple Jails</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-think-yo.html">
  iOS, the operating system of the Apple iThings, is a jail for
  users.</a>  That means it imposes censorship of application programs.</p>

  <p>Apple has used this power to
  <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/02/07/apple-yanks-last-remaining-bit.html">
  censor all bitcoin apps</a> for the iThings.</p>

  <p>Apple, in the iThings, pioneered the practice of general purpose
  computers that are jails, and the term comes from iThing users, who
  referred to escaping from the censorship as &ldquo;jailbreaking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here is an article about the <a
  href="http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2008/03/07/code-signing-and-you/">
  code signing</a> that the iThings use to jail the user.</p>

  <p>Curiously, Apple is beginning to allow limited passage through the
  walls of the the iThing jail: users can now install apps built from
  source code, provided the source code is written in Swift.  Users
  cannot do this freely because they are required to identify themselves.
  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Here are details.</a></p>

  <p>While this is a crack in the prison walls, it is not big enough to
  mean that the iThings are no longer jails.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/11/papers-please-game-ipad-nude-body-scans">
  More examples of Apple's arbitrary and inconsistent censorship</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tyrants">Apple Tyrants</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Apple arbitrarily
  <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/12/01/ios-8-1-signing-window-closed/">
  blocks users from installing old versions of iOS</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>The iThings are tyrant devices: they do not permit
  installing a different or modified operating system.  There is a
  port of Android to the iThings, but installing it
  requires <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721065208/http://www.idroidproject.org/wiki/Status">
  finding a bug or &ldquo;exploit&rdquo;</a> to make it possible to
  install a different system.</p>
