<h2>Proprietary Sabotage</h2>

<a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to
mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers,
which puts them in a position of power over the users; <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">that is the
basic injustice</a>. The developers often exercise that power to the
detriment of the users they ought to serve.</p>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary software that has something
worse than a back door.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HP's firmware downgrade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/hp-inkjet-printers-unofficial-cartridges-software-update">imposed
        DRM on some printers, which now refuse to function with
        third-party ink cartridges</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>

    <p>Once Microsoft has tricked a user into accepting installation
      of Windows
      10, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/01/windows_10_nagware_no_way_out/">they
      find that they are denied the option to cancel or even postpone
      the imposed date of installation</a>.</p>

      <p>This demonstrates what we've said for years: using
      proprietary software means letting someone have power over you,
      and you're going to get screwed sooner or later.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The Apple Music client
      program <a href="https://blog.vellumatlanta.com/2016/05/04/apple-stole-my-music-no-seriously/">scans
      the user's file system for music files, copies them to an Apple
      server, and deletes them</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Apple <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608183145/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/14/uninstall_quicktime_for_windows/">
stops users from fixing the security bugs in Quicktime for
      Windows</a>, while refusing to fix them itself.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>iOS version 9 for
    iThings <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/05/error-53-apple-iphone-software-update-handset-worthless-third-party-repair">sabotages
    them irreparably if they were repaired by someone other than
    Apple</a>. Apple eventually backed off from this policy under
    criticism from the users. However, it has not acknowledged that
    this was wrong.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>Phillips &ldquo;smart&rdquo; lightbulbs had initially been 
  designed to interact with other companies' smart light bulbs, but <a 
  href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/07452133070/lightbulb-drm-philips-locks-purchasers-out-third-party-bulbs-with-firmware-update.shtml">
  later the company updated the firmware to disallow interoperability</a>.</p>

  <p>If a product is &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, and you didn't build it, it is 
  cleverly serving its manufacturer <em>against you</em>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Microsoft
    is <a href="http://gizmodo.com/woman-wins-10-000-from-microsoft-after-unwanted-window-1782666146">
    forcibly
    pushing</a> <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3012278/microsoft-windows/microsoft-sets-stage-for-massive-windows-10-upgrade-strategy.html">Windows
    update to its version 10</a>, ignoring the flag on Windows 7 or 8
    that you could set to not upgrade.  This reaffirms the presence of
    a <a href="/proprietary/proprietary-back-doors.html">universal
    back door in Windows</a> 7 and 8.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Windows 10 &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; <a
      href="http://www.ghacks.net/2015/11/24/beware-latest-windows-10-update-may-remove-programs-automatically/">
      delete applications</a> without asking permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Google has long had <a
      href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/24/google-can-unlock-android-devices-remotely-if-phone-unencrypted">a
      back door to remotely unlock an Android device</a>, unless its
      disk is encrypted (possible since Android 5.0 Lollipop, but
      still not quite the default).</p></li>
<li><p>
Users report <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2993490/windows/windows-10-upgrades-reportedly-appearing-as-mandatory-for-some-users.html#tk.rss_all">
Microsoft is forcing them to replace Windows 7 and 8 with
all-spying Windows 10</a>.</p>

<p>
This seems to involve use of a back door in Windows 7 and 8.

<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2984889/windows-pcs/lenovo-collects-usage-data-on-thinkpad-thinkcentre-and-thinkstation-pcs.html">
Lenovo stealthily installed crapware and spyware via BIOS</a> on Windows installs.
Note that the specific sabotage method Lenovo used did not affect
GNU/Linux; also, a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; Windows install is not really
clean since <a href="/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html">Microsoft
puts in its own malware</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>Vizio
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/04/30/telescreen-watch-vizio-adds-s.html">
used a firmware &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to make its TVs snoop on what users watch</a>.
The TVs did not do that when first sold.
</p></li>

downgraded the software in users' Swindles</a>
so that those already rooted would cease to function at all.</p></li>

<li><p>Apple <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/04/apple-deleted-music-ipods-rivals-steve-jobs">deleted
from iPods the music that users had got from internet music stores
that competed with iTunes</a>.

</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/nintendo-updates-take-wii-u-hostage-until-you-agree-new-legal-terms">Nintendo
remotely sabotaged all Wiis, making them refuse to work unless the
user agrees to a new EULA.</a>
</p>
<p>We can be quite sure this EULA is is unjust because injustice is
the only motive for imposing an EULA.
</p></li>

<li><p>
FTDI's proprietary driver for its USB-to-serial chips has been
designed to
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/windows-update-drivers-bricking-usb-serial-chips-beloved-of-hardware-hackers/">sabotage
alternative compatible chips</a> so that they no longer work. Microsoft is <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/16/01/31/1720259/ftdi-driver-breaks-hardware-again">installing this automatically</a> as an
&ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/windows-xp-end-of-an-era-end-of-an-error-3569489/">Microsoft
cut off security fixes for Windows XP, except to some big
    users that pay exorbitantly.</a></p>

<p>Microsoft is going to
  <a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3605515/more-than-half-of-all-ie-users-face-patch-axe-in-10-months/">
    cut off support for some Internet Explorer versions</a> in the same way.</p>

<p>A person or company has the right to cease to work on a
particular program; the wrong here is Microsoft does this after having
made the users dependent on Microsoft, because they are not free to ask
anyone else to work on the program for them.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">The
NSA has put back doors into nonfree encryption software.</a>
We don't know which ones they are, but we can be sure they include
some widely used systems.  This reinforces the point that you can never
trust the security of nonfree software.

Adobe applications have time bombs:
they <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/06/adobe-goes-all-in-with-subscription-based-creative-cloud-will-stop-selling-regular-cs-licenses-shrink-wrapped-boxes/">stop
working after a certain time</a>, after which the user must pay to
extend the time.</p>

<p>Once there was a problem with the servers that these programs use
to check who has paid, and
<a href="http://www.macuser.co.uk/9015-adobe-creative-cloud-outage-leaves-adobe-users-locked-out">the applications refused to work for anyone</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/sony-steals-feature-from-your-playstation-3">sabotaged
the Playstation 3</a> with a firmware downgrade that removed the
feature that allowed users to run GNU/Linux on it.</p>

<p>Sony subsequently sent police after Geohot, after he cracked the
code that blocked users from changing the firmware, and we responded by
calling for a <a href="http://boycottsony.org">boycott of
Sony </a>.
</p>

<p>In a court settlement Sony is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/if-you-used-to-run-linux-on-your-ps3-you-could-get-55-from-sony/">
now paying for the sabotage</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Oracle's nonfree Java plug-in for browsers <a
href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-close-look-at-how-oracle-installs-deceptive-software-with-java-updates/">sneakily installs other annoying proprietary software</a>.</p>

<p>That article disregards all other bad things about proprietary software.  For
instance, it regards the inclusion of proprietary Flash Player (which  has a <a
href="http://www.imasuper.com/66/technology/flash-cookies-the-silent-privacy-killer/">surveillance feature</a> and DRM) in Chrome as a good thing.  Chrome
is a proprietary browser with a universal back door.</p>

<p>We don't agree with the article's views on those issues, but we present it
as a factual reference.</p>

<p>In 2014, <a
href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2494794/malware-vulnerabilities/oracle-will-continue-to-bundle--crapware--with-java.html">Oracle insisted on continuing
this practice.</a></p>
