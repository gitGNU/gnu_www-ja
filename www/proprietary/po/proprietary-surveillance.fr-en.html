<div style="clear: left;"></div>

<p>For decades, the Free Software movement has been denouncing the
abusive surveillance machine of
<a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">proprietary software</a>
companies such as
<a href="/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>
and
<a href="/proprietary/malware-apple.html">Apple</a>.

In the recent years, this tendency to watch people has spread across
industries, not only in the software business, but also in the
hardware.  Moreover, it also spread dramatically away from the
keyboard, in the mobile computing industry, in the office, at home, in
transportation systems, and in the classroom.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://duo.com/blog/bring-your-own-dilemma-oem-laptops-and-windows-10-security">
      Windows 10 comes with 13 screens of snooping options</a>, all enabled by default,
      and turning them off would be daunting to most users.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/28/recently-bought-a-windows-computer-microsoft-probably-has-your-encryption-key/">
      Microsoft has already backdoored its disk encryption</a>.</p></li>

  <li>It appears
      <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2016/01/05/microsoft-may-be-collecting-more-data-than-initially-thought/">
      Windows 10 sends data to Microsoft about what applications are 
      running</a>.</li>
  <li><p>A downgrade to Windows 10 deleted surveillance-detection
      applications.  Then another downgrade inserted a general spying
      program.  Users noticed this and complained, so Microsoft
      renamed it
      <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160407082751/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/26/microsoft_renamed_data_slurper_reinserted_windows_10/">
to give users the impression it was gone</a>.</p>

      <p>To use proprietary software is to invite such treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>
  Windows 10 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001035410/https://jonathan.porta.codes/2015/07/30/windows-10-seems-to-have-some-scary-privacy-defaults/">
  ships with default settings that show no regard for the
  privacy of its users</a>, giving Microsoft the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
  to snoop on the users' files, text input, voice input,
  location info, contacts, calendar records and web browsing
  history, as well as automatically connecting the machines to open
  hotspots and showing targeted ads.</p></li>

  <li><p>
  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/">
  Windows 10 sends identifiable information to Microsoft</a>, even if a user
  turns off its Bing search and Cortana features, and activates the
  privacy-protection settings.</p></li>

  <li><p>
  Microsoft uses Windows 10's &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo; to overtly impose a
  &ldquo;right&rdquo; to look at users' files at any time. Windows 10 full disk
  encryption <a href="https://edri.org/microsofts-new-small-print-how-your-personal-data-abused/">
  gives Microsoft a key</a>.</p>

  <p>Thus, Windows is overt malware in regard to surveillance,
  as in other issues.</p>

  <p>We can suppose Microsoft look at users' files for the US government on
  demand, though the &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo; does not explicit say so. Will it
  look at users' files for the Chinese government on demand?</p>

  <p>The unique &ldquo;advertising ID&rdquo; for each user enables other companies to
  track the browsing of each specific user.</p>

  <p>It's as if Microsoft has deliberately chosen to make Windows 10
  maximally evil on every dimension; to make a grab for total power
  over anyone that doesn't drop Windows now.</p></li>

  <li><p>It only gets worse with time.
      <a href="http://www.techworm.net/2014/10/microsofts-windows-10-permission-watch-every-move.html">
      Windows 10 requires users to give permission for total snooping</a>,
      including their files, their commands, their text input, and their
      voice input.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2611451/microsoft-windows/a-look-at-the-black-underbelly-of-windows-8-1--blue-.html">
      Windows 8.1 snoops on local searches.</a>.</p>

      secret NSA key in Windows</a>, whose functions we don't know.</p>

      <p>It also demonstrates how you can't trust proprietary software,

      iCloud Photo Library stores every photo and video you take,

      Any edits you make are automatically updated everywhere. [...]
    </p></blockquote>

    <p>(From <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/photos/">Apple's iCloud
      information</a> as accessed on 24 Sep 2015.) The iCloud feature is
      <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202033">activated by the
      startup of iOS</a>. The term &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; means
      &ldquo;please don't ask where.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There is a way to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104">
      deactivate iCloud</a>, but it's active by default so it still counts as a
      surveillance functionality.</p>

    <p>Unknown people apparently took advantage of this to
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/01/naked-celebrity-hack-icloud-backup-jennifer-lawrence">get
      nude photos of many celebrities</a>. They needed to break Apple's

      <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34444233">agencies can take over smartphones</a>
      by sending hidden text messages which enable them to turn the phones
      on and off, listen to the microphone, retrieve geo-location data from the
      GPS, take photographs, read text messages, read call, location and web
      browsing history, and read the contact list. This malware is designed to

      and they send so much data that their transmission is a

      <p>This spyware feature seems to require online access to some
      known-faces database, which means the pictures are likely to be

  <li><p>Like most &ldquo;music screaming&rdquo; disservices, Spotify

      2015 it <a

      <p>The FTC criticized this app because it asked the user to

    <p>That's easy to do because the system has no authentication when

      their users: their <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/own-a-vizio-smart-tv-its-watching-you">
      &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TVs analyze your viewing habits in detail and 
      link them your IP address</a> so that advertisers can track you 
      across devices.</p>
 
      <p>It is possible to turn this off, but having it enabled by default
      is an injustice already.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p>Tivo's alliance with Viacom adds 2.3 million households to
      the 600 millions social media profiles the company already
      monitors. Tivo customers are unaware they're being watched by
      advertisers. By combining TV viewing information with online
      social media participation, Tivo can now <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/viacom-tivo-idUSL1N12U1VV20151102">correlate TV

  <li><p>Some web and TV advertisements play inaudible sounds to be
      picked up by proprietary malware running on other devices in

     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.

     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).

     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
