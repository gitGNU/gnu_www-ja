<h2>Proprietary Tethers</h2>

<p><a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a></p>

<p>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to
mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers,
which puts them in a position of power over the users; <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">that is the
basic injustice</a>. The developers often exercise that power to the
detriment of the users they ought to serve.</p>

<p>This document reports instances where proprietary software 
is tethered to a server.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>nVidia's proprietary GeForce Experience <a href="http://www.gamersnexus.net/industry/2672-geforce-experience-data-transfer-analysis">makes
users identify themselves and then sends personal data about them to
nVidia servers</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Adobe applications <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308062844/http://www.wired.com/2013/05/adobe-creative-cloud-petition/">require
periodic connection to a server</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The iMessage app on iThings <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/09/28/apple-logs-your-imessage-contacts-and-may-share-them-with-police/">tells
a server every phone number that the user types into it</a>; the
server records these numbers for at least 30 days.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A half-blind security critique of a tracking app: it found that <a
href="http://www.consumerreports.org/mobile-security-software/glow-pregnancy-app-exposed-women-to-privacy-threats/">
blatant flaws allowed anyone to snoop on a user's personal data</a>.
The critique fails entirely to express concern that the app sends the
personal data to a server, where the <em>developer</em> gets it all.
This &ldquo;service&rdquo; is for suckers!</p>

<p>The server surely has a &ldquo;privacy policy,&rdquo; and surely it
is worthless since nearly all of them are.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Google/Alphabet <a
href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/nest-reminds-customers-ownership-isnt-what-it-used-be">
intentionally shut off home automatic control products that depend on
a server</a> to function.  The lesson is, don't stand for that! Insist
on self-contained computers that run free software!</p>
</li>

</ul>
