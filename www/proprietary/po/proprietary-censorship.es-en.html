<h2>Proprietary Censorship</h2>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary systems that impose censorship on
what their users can access. We have a <a
href="/philosophy/proprietary/proprietary-jails.html">separate
list of proprietary systems that censor installation</a> of
application programs (we call them &ldquo;jails&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>Selling products designed as platforms for a
company to impose censorship ought to be forbidden by law, but it
isn't.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
As of 2015, Apple <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/apple-anti-choice-tendencies-showing-in-app-store-reproductive-rights">systematically bans apps that endorse abortion
rights or would help women find abortions</a>.</p>

<p>
This particular political slant <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/siri-abortion-apple-unintenional-omissions">
affects other Apple services</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The <a
href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-new-3ds-charges-30-cents-to-remove-an-in/1100-6421996/">Nintendo
3DS</a> censors web browsing; it is possible to turn off the
censorship, but that requires identifying oneself to pay, which is a
form of surveillance.
