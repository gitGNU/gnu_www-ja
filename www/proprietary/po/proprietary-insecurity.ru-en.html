<h2>Proprietary Insecurity</h2>

<a href="/philosophy/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>This page lists clearly established cases of insecurity in
proprietary software that has grave consequences or is otherwise
noteworthy.</p>

<p>It would be incorrect to compare proprietary software with a
fictitious idea of free software as perfect.  Every nontrivial program
has bugs, and any system, free or proprietary, may have security
holes.  But proprietary software developers frequently disregard
gaping holes, or even introduce them deliberately, and <em>the users
are helpless to fix them</em>.</p>

    <p>Hospira infusion pumps, which are used to administer drugs to
      a patient, were rated
      &ldquo;<a

      secure IP device I've ever seen</a>&rdquo;
      by a security researcher.</p>
    <p>Depending on what drug is being infused, the insecurity could
      open the door to murder.</p>

<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/privacy-scandal-nsa-can-spy-on-smart-phone-data-a-920971.html">
The NSA can tap data in smart phones, including iPhones, Android, and
BlackBerry</a>.  While there is not much detail here, it seems that
this does not operate via the universal back door that we know nearly
all portable phones have.  It may involve exploiting various bugs.
There
are <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone">

Point-of-sale terminals running Windows were taken over and turned
into a botnet for the purpose of collecting customers' credit card
numbers</a>.

<p>An app to prevent &ldquo;identity theft&rdquo; (access to personal data)
by storing users' data on a special server
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/id-theft-protector-lifelock-deletes-user-data-over-concerns-that-app-isnt-safe/">was
deactivated by its developer</a> which had discovered a security flaw.
</p>

<p>
That developer seems to be conscientious about protecting personal
data from third parties in general, but it can't protect that data
from the state.  Quite the contrary: confiding your data to someone
else's server, if not first encrypted by you with free software,
undermines your rights.

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554"> Some flash
memories have modifiable software</a>, which makes them vulnerable to
viruses.</p>

<p>We don't call this a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; because it is normal
that you can install a new system in a computer given physical access
to it.  However, memory sticks and cards should not be modifiable in
this way.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;page=6"> Replaceable
nonfree software in disk drives can be written by a nonfree
program.</a>  This makes any system vulnerable to persistent attacks
that normal forensics won't detect.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-05-app-vulnerability-threatens-millions-users.html">
Many smartphone apps use insecure authentication methods when storing
your personal data in &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; services.</a>
This leaves personal information like email addresses, passwords, and health information vulnerable. Because many
of these apps are proprietary it makes it hard to impossible to know which apps are at risk.</p>
