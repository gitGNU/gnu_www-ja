<h2>Proprietary DRM</h2>

<a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to
mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers,
which puts them in a position of power over the users; <a
href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">that is the
basic injustice</a>. The developers often exercise that power to the
detriment of the users they ought to serve.</p>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary programs and systems that
implement <em>digital restrictions management</em> (DRM):
functionalities designed intentionally to restrict what users can do.
These functionalities are also called <em>digital handcuffs</em>.
</p>

<p>DRM is reinforced by
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management">
censorship laws</a> that ban software (and hardware) that can break
the handcuffs.  Instead of these laws, DRM itself ought to be illegal.

<li><p>Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/drm/package-summary.html">contains
facilities specifically to support DRM.</a></p>
</li>

<li><p>HP's firmware downgrade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/hp-inkjet-printers-unofficial-cartridges-software-update">imposed
DRM on some printers, which now refuse to function with third-party
ink cartridges</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Oculus Rift games
now <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/new-oculus-drm-cross-platform">have
DRM meant to prevent running them on other systems</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>The <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/post/137045828005/free-the-cube">
&ldquo;Cube&rdquo; 3D printer was designed with DRM</a>: it won't accept
third-party printing materials. It is the Keurig of printers. Now it is 
being discontinued, which means that eventually authorized materials won't 
be available and the printers may become unusable.</p>

<p>With a <a href="http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/aleph-objects">
printer that gets the Respects Your Freedom</a>, this problem would not 
even be a remote possibility.</p>

<p>How pitiful that the author of that article says that there was
&ldquo;nothing wrong&rdquo; with designing the device to restrict users in 
the first place. This is like putting a &ldquo;cheat me and mistreat me&rdquo; 
sign on your chest. We should know better: we should condemn all companies
that take advantage of people like him. Indeed, it is the acceptance of 
their unjust practice that teaches people to be doormats.</p>

have been designed not to interact with other companies' smart 
lightbulbs</a>.</p>

<p>If a product is &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, and you didn't build it, it is 
cleverly serving its manufacturer <em>against you</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://techin.oureverydaylife.com/kindle-drm-17841.html">
The Amazon Kindle has DRM</a>.  That article is flawed in that it
fails to treat DRM as an ethical question; it takes for granted that
whatever Amazon might do to its users is legitimate.  It refers to DRM
as digital &ldquo;rights&rdquo; management, which is the spin term
used to promote DRM.  Nonetheless it serves as a reference for the
facts.

<p>
We refer to that product as the

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/08/aacs-tentacles/">DRM
in Windows</a>, introduced to cater to <a href="#bluray">Bluray</a>
disks.  (The article talks about how the same malware would later be
introduced in MacOS.  That had not been done at the time, but it was
done subsequently.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/11/apple-downgrades-macbook-video-drm">DRM
in MacOS</a>.  This article focuses on the fact that a new model of
Macbook introduced a requirement for monitors to have malicious
hardware, but DRM software in MacOS is involved in activating the
hardware.  The software for accessing iTunes is also responsible.
</p>

<p>A further consequence of this malware is that users may have
trouble
<a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/08/11/18/apples_new_macbooks_have_built_in_copy_protection_measures">playing
videos on auxiliary large screens</a>.  (The article, from a
publication whose name suggests it idolizes Apple, treats these
restrictions as irreproachable.)

<p>That page uses spin terms that favor DRM,

digital &ldquo;rights&rdquo; management</a>
and <a href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Protection">&ldquo;protect&rdquo;</a>,
and it claims that &ldquo;artists&rdquo; (rather than companies) are
primarily responsible for putting digital restrictions management into
these disks.  Nonetheless, it is a reference for the facts.

<p>Every Bluray disk (with few, rare exceptions) has DRM&mdash;so
don't use Bluray disks!
