<h2>Proprietary Tyrants</h2>

<p>A <em>tyrant</em> device is one that refuses to allow users to
install a different operating system or a modified operating
system.  These devices have measures to block execution of anything
other than the &ldquo;approved&rdquo; system versions.  We also
refer to this practice as <em>tivoization</em>.

  <li><p>Apple
	  arbitrarily <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/12/01/ios-8-1-signing-window-closed/">blocks
	  users from installing old versions of iOS</a>.

  </li>

<li>
<p>The Apple iThings are tyrant devices.  There is a port of Android
to the iThings, but installing it
requires <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721065208/http://www.idroidproject.org/wiki/Status"> finding a
bug or &ldquo;exploit&rdquo;</a> to make it possible to install a
different system.

Some Android phones are tyrants</a> (though someone found a way to
crack the restriction).  Fortunately, most Android devices are not tyrants.

&ldquo;fixed&rdquo; the &ldquo;error&rdquo;</a>. Those arrogant
bastards call this &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; the users.  The article
talks of installing &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, but the context shows it is
really <a href="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> that users
install.
