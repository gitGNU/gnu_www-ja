<h2>Proprietary Back Doors</h2>

<a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Here are examples of demonstrated back doors in proprietary software.</p>

<!-- WEBMASTERS: make sure to place new items on top under each subsection -->
<ul>  
  <li><p>The universal back door in portable phones <a
    href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/remotely_eavesd_1.html">is
    employed to listen through their microphones</a>.</p>
    <p>More about <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone">the nature of this problem</a>.</p>
  </li>
 
  <li><p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/28/recently-bought-a-windows-computer-microsoft-probably-has-your-encryption-key/">
      Microsoft has already backdoored its disk encryption</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Modern gratis game cr&hellip;apps
      <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2015/09/16/we-own-you-confessions-of-a-free-to-play-producer/">
      collect a wide range of data about their users and their users' 
      friends and associates</a>.</p>

      <p>Even nastier, they do it through ad networks that merge the data
      collected by various cr&hellip;apps and sites made by different 
      companies.</p>

      <p>They use this data to manipulate people to buy things, and hunt 
      for &ldquo;whales&rdquo; who can be led to spend a lot of money. They 
      also use a back door to manipulate the game play for specific players.</p>

      <p>While the article describes gratis games, games that cost money 
      can use the same tactics.</p>    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dell computers, shipped with Windows, had a bogus root
      certificate that
      <a href="http://fossforce.com/2015/11/dell-comcast-intel-who-knows-who-else-are-out-to-get-you/">allowed
      anyone (not just Dell) to remotely authorize any software to
      run</a> on the computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baidu's proprietary Android library, Moplus, has a back door
      that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/11/millions-android-devices-vulnerable-remote-hijacking-baidu-wrote-code-google-made">can
      &ldquo;upload files&rdquo; as well as forcibly install
      apps</a>.</p>
    <p>It is used by 14,000 Android applications.</p>
  </li>
  
<li><p>ARRIS cable modem has a
  <a href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.de/2015/11/arris-cable-modem-has-backdoor-in.html?m=1">
  backdoor in the backdoor</a>.</p>
</li>
  <li><p>Caterpillar vehicles come with
     <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-19/caterpillar-depression-has-never-been-worse-it-has-cunning-plan-how-deal-it">a back-door to shutoff the engine</a>
     remotely.</p>
  </li>
<li><p>
Mac OS X had an <a href="https://truesecdev.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/hidden-backdoor-api-to-root-privileges-in-apple-os-x/">
intentional local back door for 4 years</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>Users reported that <a 
    href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2993490/windows/windows-10-upgrades-reportedly-appearing-as-mandatory-for-some-users.html#tk.rss_all">
    Microsoft was forcing them to replace Windows 7 and 8 with all-spying 
    Windows 10</a>.</p>

    <p>Microsoft was in fact <a 
    href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3012278/microsoft-windows/microsoft-sets-stage-for-massive-windows-10-upgrade-strategy.html">
    attacking computers that run Windows 7 and 8</a>, switching on a flag 
    that said whether to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to Windows 10 when users 
    had turned it off.</p>

    <p>Later on, Microsoft published instructions on <a 
    href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/microsoft-finally-has-a-proper-way-to-opt-out-of-windows-78-to-windows-10-upgrades/">
    how to permanently reject the downgrade to Windows 10</a>.</p>

    <p>This seems to involve use of a back door in Windows 7 and 8.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Most mobile phones have a universal back door, which has been used to
<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/22/nsa_can_reportedly_track_cellphones_even_when_they_re_turned_off.html">
turn them malicious</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/18/chinese-android-phones-coolpad-hacker-backdoor">
A Chinese version of Android has a universal back door</a>. Nearly all
models of mobile phones have a universal back door in the modem chip. So
why did Coolpad bother to introduce another? Because this one is controlled
by Coolpad.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Microsoft Windows has a universal back door through which
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201806263">
any change whatsoever can be imposed on the users</a>.
</p>
<p>More information on when
<a href="http://slated.org/windows_by_stealth_the_updates_you_dont_want">
this was used</a>.
</p>
<p>In Windows 10, the universal back door is no longer hidden; all
&ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; will
be <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/windows-10-updates-to-be-automatic-and-mandatory-for-home-users/">forcibly
and immediately imposed</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Windows 8's back doors are so gaping that
<a href="http://drleonardcoldwell.com/2013/08/23/leaked-german-government-warns-key-entities-not-to-use-windows-8-linked-to-nsa/">
the German government has decided it can't be trusted</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The iPhone has a back door
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358134/Apples-Jobs-confirms-iPhone-kill-switch.html">
that allows Apple to remotely delete apps</a> which Apple considers
&ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.  Jobs said it's ok for Apple to have this power
because of course we can trust Apple.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The iPhone has a back door for
<a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/11/22/131511381/wipeout-when-your-company-kills-your-iphone">
remote wipe</a>.  It's not always enabled, but users are led into enabling
it without understanding.
</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Apple can, and regularly does,
    <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/05/new-guidelines-outline-what-iphone-data-apple-can-give-to-police/">
  remotely extract some data from iPhones for the state</a>.
  </p>
  <p>This may have improved with
  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2014/09/17/2612af58-3ed2-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html">
  iOS 8 security improvements</a>; but
  <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/22/apple-data/">
  not as much as Apple claims</a>.</p>
  </li>


<li>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2500036/desktop-apps/microsoft--we-can-remotely-delete-windows-8-apps.html">
Windows 8 also has a back door for remotely deleting apps</a>.
</p>

<p>
You might well decide to let a security service that you trust
remotely <em>deactivate</em> programs that it considers malicious.
But there is no excuse for <em>deleting</em> the programs, and you
should have the right to decide who (if anyone) to trust in this way.
</p>

<p>
As these pages show, if you do want to clean your computer of malware,
the first software to delete is Windows or iOS.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In Android,
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2506557/security0/google-throws--kill-switch--on-android-phones.html">
Google has a back door to remotely delete apps.</a>  (It is in a program
called GTalkService).
</p>

<p>
Google can also
<a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/blog/2010/06/25/remote-kill-and-install-on-google-android/">
forcibly and remotely install apps</a> through GTalkService (which
seems, since that article, to have been merged into Google Play).
This is not equivalent to a universal back door, but permits various
dirty tricks.
</p>

<p>
Although Google's <em>exercise</em> of this power has not been
malicious so far, the point is that nobody should have such power,
which could also be used maliciously.  You might well decide to let a
security service remotely <em>deactivate</em> programs that it
considers malicious.  But there is no excuse for allowing it
to <em>delete</em> the programs, and you should have the right to
decide who (if anyone) to trust in this way.

<li>
<p>The Amazon Kindle has a back door that has been used to
<a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/">
remotely erase books</a>.
</p>

<p>The Kindle also has a

<li>
<p>HP &ldquo;storage appliances&rdquo; that use the proprietary
&ldquo;Left Hand&rdquo; operating system have back doors that give
HP <a href="http://news.dice.com/2013/07/11/hp-keeps-installing-secret-backdoors-in-enterprise-storage/">
remote login access</a> to them.  HP claims that this does not give HP
access to the customer's data, but if the back door allows installation of
software changes, a change could be installed that would give access to the
customer's data.

<p>Here is a big problem whose details are still secret.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/11/fbi-microsoft-bitlocker-backdoor/">
The FBI asks lots of companies to put back doors in proprietary programs.
</a> We don't know of specific cases where this was done, but every
proprietary program for encryption is a possibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a suspicion that we can't prove, but is worth thinking
about.</p>
