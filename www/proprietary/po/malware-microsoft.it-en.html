<h2>Microsoft's Software is Malware</h2>

<div class="highlight-para">
<p>
<em>Malware</em> means software designed to function in ways that
mistreat or harm the user.  (This does not include accidental errors.)
This page explains how Microsoft software is malware.
</p>

<p>
Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The difference
between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and
nonfree software is in
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware,
because the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix
any malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.

<h3 id="back-doors">Microsoft Back Doors</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Microsoft Windows has a universal back door through which <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201806263">
  any change whatsoever can be imposed on the users</a>.</p>

  <p>More information on when <a href="http://slated.org/windows_by_stealth_the_updates_you_dont_want">
  this was used</a>.</p>

  <p>In Windows 10, the universal back door is no longer hidden; all &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; will be
  <a href="http://www.appy-geek.com/Web/ArticleWeb.aspx?regionid=1&amp;articleid=42633691&amp;source=googleplus">forcibly and immediately imposed</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2500036/desktop-apps/microsoft--we-can-remotely-delete-windows-8-apps.html">
  Windows 8 also has a back door for remotely deleting apps</a>.</p>

  <p>You might well decide to let a security service that you trust
  remotely <em>deactivate</em> programs that it considers malicious.
  But there is no excuse for <em>deleting</em> the programs, and you
  should have the right to decide who (if anyone) to trust in this way.</p></li>

  <li><p>Windows 8's back doors are so gaping that <a href="http://drleonardcoldwell.com/2013/08/23/leaked-german-government-warns-key-entities-not-to-use-windows-8-linked-to-nsa/">
  the German government has decided it can't be trusted</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sabotage">Microsoft Sabotage</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2013/06/how-can-any-company-ever-trust-microsoft-again/index.htm">
  Microsoft informs the NSA of bugs in Windows before fixing them.</a></p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2014/04/windows-xp-end-of-an-era-end-of-an-error/index.htm">
  Microsoft cut off security fixes for Windows XP, except to some big users
  that pay exorbitantly.</a></p>

  <p>Microsoft is going to
  <a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3605515/more-than-half-of-all-ie-users-face-patch-axe-in-10-months/">
  cut off support for some Internet Explorer versions</a> in the same way.</p>

  <p>I think a person or company has the right to cease to work on a
  particular program; the wrong here is Microsoft does this after having
  made the users dependent on Microsoft, so they are not free to ask
  someone else to work on the program for them.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="surveillance">Microsoft Surveillance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>
  Microsoft uses Windows 10's &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo; to overtly impose a
  &ldquo;right&rdquo; to look at users' files at any time. Windows 10 full disk
  encryption <a href="https://edri.org/microsofts-new-small-print-how-your-personal-data-abused/">
  gives Microsoft a key</a>.</p>

  <p>Thus, Windows is overt malware in regard to surveillance,
  as in other issues.</p>

  <p>We can suppose Microsoft look at users' files for the US government on
  demand, though the &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo; does not explicit say so. Will it
  look at users' files for the Chinese government on demand?</p>

  <p>The unique &ldquo;advertising ID&rdquo; for each user enables other companies to
  track the browsing of each specific user.</p>

  <p>It's as if Microsoft has deliberately chosen to make Windows 10
  maximally evil on every dimeinsion; to make a grab for total power
  over anyone that doesn't drop Windows now.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.techworm.net/2014/10/microsofts-windows-10-permission-watch-every-move.html">
  Windows 10 requires users to give permission for total snooping</a>,
  including their files, their commands, their text input, and their
  voice input.</p></li>

  <li>Spyware in Windows: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/28/windows_update_keeps_tabs/">
  Windows Update snoops on the user.</a>
  <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/microsoft-windows/look-the-black-underbelly-of-windows-81-blue-222175">

  <a href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article40836.html">
  secret NSA key in Windows</a>, whose functions we don't know.</li>

  Microsoft SkyDrive allows the NSA to directly examine users' data.</a></p>

<h3 id="drm">Microsoft DRM</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/08/aacs-tentacles/">
  DRM (digital restrictions mechanisms) in Windows</a>, introduced to
  cater to <a href="/proprietary/proprietary-drm.html#bluray">Bluray</a> disks.
  (The article also talks about how the same malware would later be introduced
  in MacOS.)</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/301057/microsoft-metro-app-store-lockdown">
  Windows 8 on &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; is a jail</a>: it censors the
  user's choice of application programs.</p></li>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/">
  Mobile devices that come with Windows 8 are tyrants</a>: they block
  users from installing other or modified operating systems.</p></li>
</ul>

the first software to delete is Windows.</p>
