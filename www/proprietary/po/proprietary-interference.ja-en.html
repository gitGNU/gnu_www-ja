<h2>Proprietary Interference</h2>

<p>
This page describes how various proprietary programs mess up the
user's system. They are like sabotage, but they are not grave enough
to qualify for the word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo;. Nonetheless, they are nasty and
wrong.
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Apple forced millions of iThings to <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7256669?tstart=0">download a system upgrade
without asking the users.</a> Apple did not forcibly install the upgrade
but the downloading alone caused lots of trouble.</p></li>

<li><p>Adobe nonfree software may halt all other work and freeze a computer <a
href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/gimp/non-free-software-surprises.html">
to perform a license check</a>, at a random time every 30 days.</p></li>

<li><p>Microsoft
has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/16/10780876/microsoft-windows-support-policy-new-processors-skylake">desupported
all future Intel CPUs for Windows 7 and 8</a>. Those machines will be
stuck with the nastier Windows 10.
<a href="http://gizmodo.com/only-the-latest-version-of-windows-will-run-on-some-fut-1753545825">
AMD and Qualcomm CPUs, too</a>.
</p>
<p>Of course, Windows 7 and 8 are unethical too, because they are
proprietary software.  But this example of Microsoft's wielding its
power demonstrates the power it holds.
</p>
<p>Free software developers also stop maintaining old versions of their
programs, but this is not unfair to users because the users of free
software have control over it.  If it is important enough to you, you
and other users can hire someone to support the old version on your
  future platforms.
</p></li>

<li><p>Oracle made a deal with Yahoo; Oracle's nonfree Java plug-in will
<a href="http://searchengineland.com/yahoo-signs-deal-with-oracle-to-attract-new-users-via-java-installs-224097">
change the user's initial web page, and default search engine, to Yahoo</a>
unless the user intervenes to stop it.</p></li>

<li><p>
Microsoft is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/11/microsoft-downloading-windows-1">
repeatedly nagging many users to install Windows 10</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Microsoft is <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/02/microsoft-downloading-windows-10-automatic-update">
tricking users into &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; to Windows 10</a>, if they
fail to notice and say no.
</p></li>
