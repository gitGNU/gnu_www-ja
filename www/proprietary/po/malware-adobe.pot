"Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The difference "
"between <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a> and nonfree "
"software is in <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html\"> whether the "
"users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's not directly a "
"question of what the program <em>does</em> when it runs.  However, in "
"practice nonfree software is often malware, because the developer's "
"awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any malicious "
"functionalities tempts the developer to impose some."
