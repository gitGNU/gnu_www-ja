<h2>Adobe's Software is Malware</h2>

<p><a href="/proprietary/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary
malware</a></p>

<div class="highlight-para">
<p>
<em>Malware</em> means software designed to function in ways that
mistreat or harm the user.  (This does not include accidental errors.)
This page explains how Adobe software is malware.
</p>

<p>Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The
difference between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</a> and nonfree software is in
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware,
because the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix
any malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.

<p><a

Adobe tools require a subscription</a>.  Adobe also tried to <a
href="http://chocolateandvodka.com/2014/02/20/adobe-creative-cloud-subscription-warning/">
rip people off by making the subscriptions annual</a>,
but that is a secondary issue compared with the basic wrong of the
time bomb.  When a program proprietary, and even malware, don't get
distracted by the secondary issues like price.</p>

<p>Please don't repeat the marketing term &ldquo;Creative Cloud&rdquo;
except to express revulsion for it.  The <a
href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#CloudComputing"> term
&ldquo;cloud&rdquo; is designed to cloud users' minds</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Adobe nonfree software may halt all other work and freeze a
computer <a
href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/gimp/non-free-software-surprises.html">
to perform a license check</a>, at a random time every 30
days.</p></li>

<li><p>Adobe applications have time bombs: they <a
href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/06/adobe-goes-all-in-with-subscription-based-creative-cloud-will-stop-selling-regular-cs-licenses-shrink-wrapped-boxes/">
stop working after a certain time</a>, after which the user must pay
to extend the time.</p>

<p>Once there was a problem with the servers that these programs use
to check who has paid, and <a
href="http://www.macuser.co.uk/9015-adobe-creative-cloud-outage-leaves-adobe-users-locked-out">
the applications refused to work for anyone</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Adobe made &ldquo;Digital Editions,&rdquo; the e-reader used by
most US libraries, <a
href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/drm-strikes-again-3575860/">
send lots of data to Adobe</a>.  Adobe's &ldquo;excuse&rdquo;: it's
needed to check DRM!</p></li>
