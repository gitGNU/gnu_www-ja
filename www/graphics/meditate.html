   width="150" height="130" /></a>
</p>

<p>This color drawing depicts a levitating gnu, deep in meditation,
wrapped snugly in a gold robe.  Both he and his computer float
gracefully above the floor&mdash;only his tail lightly touches the
ground.  He gently holds a recorder between his front hooves, as if he
has just gotten the inspiration to charm his computer with music.  There
is a gleam in his eyes as he gazes ahead at his computer screen.</p>

<p>
We thank the artists of the Nevrax Design Team, for drawing this
beautiful picture, and their employer, Nevrax Limited, for giving them
time to work on it.</p>
