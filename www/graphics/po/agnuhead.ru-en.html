<h2>A GNU Head</h2>

<p><a href="/graphics/gnu-head-sm.jpg"><img src="/graphics/gnu-head-sm.jpg"
alt=" [Image of the head of a GNU] "
width="129" height="122" style="float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>You may prefer to use <a href="/graphics/heckert_gnu.html">a bold
GNU Head</a>, which is the version now used by the Free Software
Foundation on any new GNU-emblem items, and stickers.</p>

<p>A handsome GNU Head with typical beard and smart-looking curled horns.
He or she appears to be smiling contentedly with its works as of yet,
but it still gazes off into the distance. It is available for use under either the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GFDL 1.3</a>, <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:FAL1.3">the Free Art License</a>, or under <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:CC_ASA2.0">CC-BY-SA 2.0</a>. It is, however, also a trademark for the GNU Project.  <strong>If you want to use the GNU head to link to a website run by the Free Software Foundation or the
GNU project, feel free, or if you're using it in contexts talking
about GNU in a supportive and accurate way, you can also do this
without permission. For any other requests, please
ask <a href="mailto:licensing@fsf.org">licensing@fsf.org</a> for
permission first.</strong></p>

<p>This graphic was drawn by Etienne Suvasa, who has also done several
covers for FSF publications.</p>

<p>We also would like to thank Peter Gerwinski for the 1200x1200 PNG version
of this image.</p>

<p>This Head of a GNU was the default art for pages on this web site
including <a href="/home.html">GNU's home page</a>.</p>

<p>This Head of a GNU was also used on the front of the 1997
<a href="/order/t-shirts.html">GNU T-shirt</a>.
It is also on the spine of many
<a href="/doc/doc.html">GNU Manuals</a>.</p>

<p>Dustin Jorge made a nice wallpaper inspired by this GNU head. He spent
some time researching copyright for a paper he had to do for a
class. In the meantime he made this desktop.</p>

  <li>png <a href="/graphics/gnublue.png">503k</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Ville Solarius has come up with the following variations of the GNU Head in the SVG format: </p>
<ul>
   <li>Plain <a href="/graphics/gnuhead_plain.svg">99.2k</a></li>
   <li>Inkscape <a href="/graphics/gnuhead_inkscape.svg">99.2k</a></li>
