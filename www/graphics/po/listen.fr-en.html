This color drawing depicts a gnu lounging comfortably in a golden robe.  He
wears large headphones.  His eyes are closed, and he has a look of
contentment on his face.  He clearly enjoys what he is hearing.  In his
front hooves, he holds a portable CD player, and a few CDs lay on the floor
in front of him.  Also on the floor are a two speakers, which are also
plugged into his portable unit.

<p>
We thank the artists of the Nevrax Design Team, for drawing this
beautiful picture, and their employer, Nevrax Limited, for giving him
time to work on it.
