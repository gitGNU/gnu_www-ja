<p>A first for the Free Software Foundation, we now have abstract art
of our mascot courtesy of Kursad
Karatas. He provides an explanation of this work -</p>

<blockquote><p><i>I just wanted to express "wisdom", the wisdom of
knowledge, wisdom of love, wisdom of fertility, wisdom of humanity,
wisdom of brotherhood. This is what we need and what I feel modern
society currently lacks. There are a lot of great artists who have
created great works for GNU (as shown on the art page), and I wanted
to express an alternative reality, or alternative understanding of
GNU.</i></p>
  
<p><i>I wanted to make a piece for GNU because I believe that
information is universal, that no one person can own it. The sharing
of information is a direct result of language, and language belongs to
all of us. Not to one person, not to one corporation, not to one
state, not to one colony, but to all of mankind. As you see the GNU
holds his fingers in the sign for victory, because I know that one day
information and thought will be free and we all will be
victorious.</i></p>
 
<p><i>The cherries and apple symbolizes wisdom, the beard symbolizes a
special kind of wisdom that comes from a journey of knowledge and
beauty that no other person can take, and the GNU's eyes express a
profound dedication. The blue background is simply freedom as in
"birds".</i></p>
 
<p><i>This may not be the greatest work since I just focused on being
honest while creating it. I tried to show and define the mind set of
someone who seeks freedom of self and thought, and tries to be
harmonious with the world. Well, that is what I tried, that does not
necessarily mean I have achieved it. It is up to viewers to decide for
themselves. :)</i></p></blockquote>
