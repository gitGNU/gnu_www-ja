"In this very nice painting by Péhä &lt;<a "
"href=\"mailto:contact.peha@posteo.net\">contact.peha@posteo.net</a>&gt;, Gnu "
"and Tux are depicted as warriors.  Gnu leans on his ax, and carries a shield "
"adorned with the copyleft logo.  Tux carries a sword. From the top of a "
"steep hill, they look at the fire-devastated area around them. Three ominous "
"birds are flying in the smoke-darkened sky."

"messenger; however, in my painting Tux and Gnu are messengers of Free "
"Software (not death) on the digital front. -- <em>Péhä</em>"
