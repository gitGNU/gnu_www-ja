"This color drawing depicts a levitating gnu, deep in meditation, wrapped "
"snugly in a gold robe.  Both he and his computer float gracefully above the "
"floor&mdash;only his tail lightly touches the ground.  He gently holds a "
"recorder between his front hooves, as if he has just gotten the inspiration "
"to charm his computer with music.  There is a gleam in his eyes as he gazes "
"ahead at his computer screen."
