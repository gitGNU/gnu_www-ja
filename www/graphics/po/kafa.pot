"universal, that no one person can own it. The sharing of information is a "
"direct result of language, and language belongs to all of us. Not to one "
"person, not to one corporation, not to one state, not to one colony, but to "
"all of mankind. As you see the GNU holds his fingers in the sign for "
"victory, because I know that one day information and thought will be free "
"and we all will be victorious.</i>"

"achieved it. It is up to viewers to decide for themselves. :)</i>"
