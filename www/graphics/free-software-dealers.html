     alt=" [Gnu and Tux as messengers of free software in the
           desolate land of proprietary software] " />
</div>

<p>In this very nice painting by Péhä &lt;<a
href="mailto:contact.peha@posteo.net">contact.peha@posteo.net</a>&gt;,
Gnu and Tux are depicted as warriors.
Gnu leans on his ax, and carries a shield adorned with the copyleft logo.
Tux carries a sword. From the top of a steep hill, they look at the
fire-devastated area around them. Three ominous birds are flying in the
smoke-darkened sky.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<cite>Free-Software Dealers</cite> is a tribute to Frank Frazetta and his famous
<cite>Death Dealer</cite>. In Frazetta's painting, the warrior is a sort of
messenger of Death on the battlefront. I kept the idea of the messenger;
however, in my painting Tux and Gnu are messengers of Free Software (not
death) on the digital front. -- <em>Péhä</em>
