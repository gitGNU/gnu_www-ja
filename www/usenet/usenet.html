<h3 id="introduction">Introduction to gnu.*</h3>

<p>
The gnu.* USENET (or gnUSENET) hierarchy is a collection of newsgroups
about the GNU Project.  Most of the newsgroups correspond to GNU mailing
lists and just provide an alternate way for people to read and post to
those mailing lists if they prefer a USENET interface to a mail interface.
There are also a small number of newsgroups that do not have corresponding
mailing lists.
</p><p>
The gnu.* newsgroups are carried by most large and many small news
servers, but the hierarchy went unmaintained for a very long time.  As of
May 2007, there is an effort underway to actively maintain the hierarchy, 
with the newsgroups and mailing lists again linked to each other using the 
gatewaying abilities of 
<a href="/software/mailman/mailman.html">GNU Mailman</a>.
</p><p>
This page lists the current information on how to carry and maintain the
gnu.* newsgroups.  This information has changed as of 2007, so if you are
a news administrator, you may need to update your server configuration.
If you are interested in reading the gnu.* newsgroups and your local
server does not carry the current newsgroup list, please refer your local
news administrator to this page.
</p>

<h3 id="newsgroups">List of gnu.* newsgroups</h3>

<p>
Here is the <a href="/usenet/newsgroups.txt">list of newsgroups in the
gnu.* hierarchy</a>.  The format of this file is in USENET checkgroups
format, suitable for processing with a program such as INN's docheckgroups
program to add those newsgroups to a news server.
</p>

<h3 id="carrying">Carrying gnu.*</h3>
<p>
To automatically create new gnu.* newsgroups and remove defunct ones,
please honor all control messages in gnu.* from usenet@gnu.org that are
signed by the corresponding GPG public key (see below).  The INN
control.ctl entry is:

<p>
A very long time ago, control messages used to  be sent from 
gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu or from news@prep.ai.mit.edu; these addresses 
are now entirely obsolete.  
</p><p>
All control messages in the gnu.* hierarchy are signed with a GPG
signature using <a href="/software/gnupg/gnupg.html">the GNU Privacy
Guard (GnuPG)</a>.  News servers should have a mechanism that allows them
to verify those signatures; see your news server documentation.
