<p><i>Libby Reinish, FSF campaigns manager, is the contact person for any reports of 
violations of the anti-harassment policy during the celebration. If you need to file a 
report, find Libby or call her at 413-275-4786.</i>
</p>
<p>The FSF is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. 
</p>
<ul><li> We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Offensive 
or graphic sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, 
including talks. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from 
the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.
</li></ul>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, 
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public 
spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, 
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and 
unwelcome sexual attention. 
</p>
<ul><li> Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply 
immediately.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may 
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from 
the conference. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have 
any other concerns, please contact a member of <a href="http://www.fsf.org/about/staff" 
class="external text" rel="nofollow">FSF staff</a> immediately. FSF staff are available in 
every conference track and at the information desk throughout the conference.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security 
or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing 
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. 
</li></ul>
<p><b>We value your attendance.</b></p>
<hr>
<p>This policy is based on several other policies, including the OLF anti-harassment 
policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment 
Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the 
policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other 
groups contributed to this work.
