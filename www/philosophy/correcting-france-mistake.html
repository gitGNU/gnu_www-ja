<h2>Correcting My Mistake about French Law</h2>

<p>by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/"><strong>Richard
Stallman</strong></a></p>

<p>For several years I've said in my speeches that it was a crime in
France, punishable by imprisonment, to have a copy of the free
software that can decrypt the video on a DVD. That encryption is an
example of DRM (Digital Restrictions Management), the malicious
features <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org/">designed to restrict
users</a>.</p>

<p>That is what Sarkozy's DADVSI law said when it was adopted, but I
recently learned that the Conseil d'Etat introduced some
exceptions. In fact, free software to decrypt and play DVDs is
legally distributed in France&mdash;unlike the US, where it was censored
by the infamous 1998 law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>

<p>However, it's not clear whether this will apply to other DRM schemes.
There is a danger that the complex conditions will specifically
prohibit free software for playing Bluray disks and allow only
proprietary software. Thus, it is not a crime in France to possess
the free software that can play a DVD, but it is yet to be decided
whether it is a crime to possess a free program to play a Bluray disk.</p>

<p>It is certainly not <em>wrong</em> to have a copy of such a program.
The software that's wrong is nonfree software; the only ethical
program to play a video, or do anything else, is a free program. The
wrong here is in the law itself. However, as long as it exists, if
you are a dissident in France you should keep such programs hidden.</p>

<p>When I first got a drive that handles DVDs, the reason I decided not
to install free DVD-playing software was because of this French law.
I go to France from time to time, and I was concerned there might be
some who would wish to have me imprisoned for this so as to terrorize
other netizens. I refuse to have any nonfree software, and the only
option that left me was to have no software for this job. Thus, I
could not play encrypted DVDs at all.</p>

<p>Knowing now that I won't be imprisoned for bringing libdvdcss into
France, I could consider having a copy, which would give me the option
of playing DVDs that have DRM.</p>

<p>However, I think I won't do it. I have got used to avoiding encrypted
DVDs, and this has the bonus of giving Hollywood no money with which to
lobby for nasty laws like SOPA. Why change?</p>
