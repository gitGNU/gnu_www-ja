<h2>The Danger of Software Patents</h2>

<p class="center">
<i>Speech by Richard M. Stallman<br />
at Government Model Engineering College, India</i>
</p>

<h3>Introduction of the speaker</h3>

<p><strong>Prof. Jyothi John, Head of Computer Engineering Department
introduces Stallman:</strong></p>

<p>
It's my privilege and duty to welcome the most distinguished guest
ever we had in this college.
</p>
<p> Mr. Richard Mathew Stallman launched the development of the GNU
operating system in 1984, the goal being to create a completely free
Unix-like operating system.  The organization that was founded in 1985
to further this purpose is the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
Stallman is a visionary of computing in our times, and is the genius
behind programs such as emacs, gcc, the GNU debugger and more.  Most
importantly, he's the author of the GNU General Public License, the
license under which more than half of all free software is distributed
and developed.  The combination of GNU with Linux, the kernel, called
the GNU/Linux operating system, now has an estimated twenty million
users worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Stallman's concept of free software talks about freedom, rather than
about price.  His ideas go a long way into ensuring development of
software for the welfare of society, collectively developed by
programmers who do not &ldquo;lock up&rdquo; their work, but rather
release it for others to study, modify and redistribute.
</p>
<p>
Stallman received the Grace Hopper award from the Association for
Computing Machinery for 1991, in 1990 he was awarded MacArthur
Foundation Fellowship &mdash; other recipients of this prestigious
award include Noam Chomsky and Tim Berners-Lee. In 1996, an honorary
doctorate of Technology from the Royal Institute, Sweden was awarded
to him.  In 1998, he received the Electronic Frontier Foundation's
Pioneer award, along with Linus Torvalds.  In 1999 he received the
Yuri Rubinski Memorial award.
</p>
<p>
Today, Stallman will be talking about the danger of software
patents.  In fact this is one of the most important aspect of the
freedom of programming because the aspect of software patents may make
all programmers potential lawbreakers because unknowingly they may be
violating some of the patents registered by some other company.
</p>

<h3>Stallman's speech</h3>
<p>
After that introduction, I am sure many of you want to know about Free
Software.  But unfortunately that's not what I am supposed to speak
about.  In fact, this topic, software patents, is not very closely
related to the issue of Free Software.  Software patents are a danger
that affect all programmers and all computer users.  I found out about
them of course in working on Free Software because they are a danger
to my project as well as to every other software project in the world.
</p>
<p>
There is a very unfortunate phrase that you may have heard.  It is the
phrase &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;.  Now, there are two things
wrong with this phrase.  One &mdash; it prejudges the most important
policy question about how to treat some kind of ideas or practices or
work.  So, whatever it assumes that they are going to be treated as
some kind of property.  Now, this is a public policy decision and you
should be able to consider various alternatives to choose the best
one.  Which means you shouldn't name the whole field, name the
question with with a term that prejudges what kind of answer you use.
</p>
<p>
But second and and even more fundamental, that term is actually a
catalogue for totally different areas of law including copyrights,
patents, trademarks, trade secrets and various other things as well.
Now these areas of a law in fact have almost nothing in common.  What
the laws say is totally different from one to the next.  Their origins
are completely independent and the public policy issues that they
raise are completely different.  So the only intelligent way to think
about them is to pick one of them and think about it; think about them
separately.
</p>
<p>
So the intelligent way to talk about them is never to generalize about
them but to talk about a specific one, you know, talk about copyrights
or talk about patents or talk about trademarks, but never lump them
all together as intellectual property because that is a recipe for
simplistic conclusions.  It is almost impossible to think
intelligently about &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and so I
refuse to do that.  I just tell people why the term is a mistake and
then if you ask me for my opinion on copyrights or my opinion on
patents it will take me an hour to tell you it.  But they are two
different opinions and my opinion on trademarks is something
completely different as well.
</p>
<p>
So the most important thing for you to start with is never mix
copyrights and patents as topics. They have nothing to do for each
other.  Let me tell you some of the basic differences between
copyrights and patents: a copyright deals with a particular work,
usually a written work and it has to do with the details of that work.
Ideas are completely excluded from it. Patents, by contrast &mdash;
well, patent covers an idea. It's that simple and any idea that you
can describe &mdash; that's what a patent might restrict you from
doing.
</p>
<p>
Now, copyrights have to do with copying; if you wrote something that
was word for word the same as some famous novel and you could prove
that you did this while you were locked up in a room and you have
never seen that novel, this would not be copyright violation because
it's not copying.  But a patent is an absolute monopoly on using a
particular idea.  Even if you could show that you thought of it on
your own that would be considered totally irrelevant.  It doesn't help
you.
</p>
<p>
Now, copyrights exist automatically.  Whenever anything is written, it
is copyrighted.  Patents are issued through an expensive application
process.  There is an expensive fee and even more expense in paying
lawyers, which of course tends to be good for big companies and the
patent office says that it only issues patents for things that are
unobvious.  However, practically speaking, in many patent offices the
criterion is unobvious to somebody with an IQ of fifty.  And they have
all sorts of excuses to ignore the fact that whenever any programmer
looks at it his first statement is, &ldquo;this is absurd, it's
obvious&rdquo;.  They say, &ldquo;well, this is hindsight&rdquo;.  So
they have an excuse to completely ignore the judgment of everybody
who really is a programmer.
</p>
<p>
Now, copyrights last an extremely long time. In the US today it's
possible for copyrights to last for a 150 years, which is absurd.
Patents don't last that long; they merely last for a long time &mdash;
20 years which in the field of software, as you can imagine is a long
time.  Now there are many other differences as well.  In fact every
detail is different.  So the worst thing you should ever do is to
learn something about copyrights and suppose that the same is true of
patents.  No, more likely it is not true of patents.  If it's true of
copyrights, it's not true of patents. That would be a better guideline
if you had to guess.
</p>
<p>
Now most of the time when people describe how the patent system works
they are people with a vested interest in the system.  And so they
describe the patent system from the point of view of somebody who
wants to get a patent and then point it at programmers and say,
&ldquo;hand me your money&rdquo;.  This is natural, you know, when
they sell lottery tickets they talk about people who win, not people
who lose.  Of course most of the people lose, but they don't want you
to think about them and so they talk about the ones who win.  It's the
same with patents.
</p>
<p>
The patent system is a very expensive lottery for its participants.
But of course the people who run the system want you to think about
the small chance you might win.  So to redress this imbalance, I am
going to explain what the patent system looks like from the point of
view of somebody who might be a victim of a patent.  That is, somebody
who wants to develop software.  So, suppose that you want to develop a
program and you were in a country that has software patents.  How do
you have to deal with the patent system.
</p>
<p>
Well, the first thing is you have to find out about the patents that
might potentially affect your area.  This is impossible, because
patents that are in the pipeline being considered by the patent
office, are secret.  Well, in some countries they are published after
18 months but that still gives plenty of time for it to be secret.  So
you might develop a program this year, which is perfectly legal and
safe this year.  And then next year, a patent could be issued and all
of a sudden you could be sued.  It happens, or your users could get
sued.
</p>
<p>
For instance, in 1984 the compress program was developed and since it
was Free Software. It was distributed by many companies along with
Unix systems.  Well, in 1985, a US patent was issued on the LZW
compression algorithm used by compress.  And after a few years UNISYS
began squeezing money out of various companies.
</p>
<p>
Well, since we in the GNU project needed a data compression program
and since we could not use compress we began looking for some other
compression program.  We found that somebody came forward and said,
&ldquo;I have been working on this algorithm for a year and now I have
decided I am going to contribute it to you.  Here is the code&rdquo;.
We were a week away from releasing this program when I just happened
to see a copy of the New York Times, which doesn't happen very often,
and it just happened to have the weekly patents column and I noted it
and so I read it.  It said that somebody had got a patent for
inventing a new method, a better method of data compression.
</p>
<p>
Well, that was not in fact true.  When I saw this I thought we'd
better get copy of this patent and see if it's a problem and it turned
out to cover exactly the same algorithm that we were about to release.
So this program was killed one week before it was released.  And in
fact that person, that patent holder had not invented a better method
because in fact it wasn't new, but that doesn't matter.  He had a
monopoly.
</p>
<p>
So eventually we found another compression algorithm which is used in
the program that's known as GISA.  But this illustrates the danger
that you face: even if you had unlimited resources, you couldn't find
out about all the patents that might endanger your project.  But you
can find out about the issued patents because they are published by
the patent office.  So in principle you could read them all, and see
what they restrict you from doing.  Practically speaking, though, once
there are software patents there are so many of them that you can't
keep up with them.
</p>
<p>
In the US there are over a hundred thousand of them; may be two
hundred thousand of them.  This is just an estimate.  I know that 10
years ago they were issuing 10,000 a year and I believe it has
accelerated since then.  So it's too much for you to keep track of
them unless that's your full-time job.  Now you can try to search for
those that are relevant to what you are doing, and this works some of
the time.  If you search for keywords or follow links you'll find some
patents that are relevant to what you are doing.  You won't find them
all.
</p>
<p>
Now, a few years ago somebody had a US patent &mdash; may be it's
expired by now &mdash; on natural order recalculation in spreadsheets.
Now, what does this mean?  It means the original spreadsheets did the
recalculation always from top to bottom.  Which meant, if a cell
depends on a lower cell, then it wouldn't get recalculated the first
time.  You have to do another recalculation to get that one.  Clearly
it's better to do the recalculation in the order, you know, if A
depends on B then do B first and then do A.  This way a single
recalculation will make everything consistent.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's what the patent covered.  Now if you search for the term
spreadsheet you would not have found that patent because that term did
not appear in it.  The phrase &ldquo;natural order
recalculation&rdquo; didn't appear either.  This algorithm, and it was
indeed the algorithm they covered basically every imaginable way of
coding this algorithm.  The algorithm is called topological sorting
and that term did not appear in the patent either.  It presented
itself as a patent on a technique for compilation.  So reasonable
searching would not have found this patent but it would have been a
reason to sue you.
</p>
<p>
In fact you can't tell what a software patent covers even roughly,
except by studying it carefully.  This is different from patents in
other areas because in other areas there is some physical thing
happening and the details of that physical thing usually give you a
sort of anger so that you can tell whether it relates or not.  But in
software there is no such thing and so it's easy for two totally
different ways of saying something to cover, in fact, the same
computation and it takes careful study to see that they cover the same
one.  Because of this even the patent office can't keep track.  So
there is not one, but two patents covering LZW data compression.  The
first one was issued in 1985 and the second, I think, in 1989.
</p>
<p>
But that one had been applied for even earlier.  One of these patents
belongs to Unisys and the other belongs to IBM.  Now, this kind of
mistake is not in fact that rare.  It's not the only one.  You see
patent examiners don't have a lot of time to spend on one patent.  In
the US they have an average of 17 hours per patent.  Now that's not
enough to carefully study all the other patents in the area to see if
they are really the same thing.  So they are going to make this kind
of mistake over and over.  So you won't find all the patents that
might threaten you but you might find some of them.
</p>
<p>
So then what do you do?  You have to try to figure out precisely what
these patents prohibit.  That is very hard because patents are written
in tortuous legal language which is very hard for an engineer to
understand.  You are going to have to work with a lawyer to do it.
</p>
<p>
In the 1980's the Australian Government commissioned a study of the
patent system.  The patent system in general, not software patents.
This study concluded that Australia would be better off abolishing the
patent system because it did very little good for society and cause a
lot of trouble.  The only reason they didn't recommend is that
international pressure.  So one of the things they cited was that
patents which was supposed to disclose information so that they would
no longer be secret or in fact useless, for that purpose, engineers
never looked at patents to try and learn anything because it's too
hard to read them.  In fact they quoted that an engineer saying
&ldquo;I can't recognize my own inventions in patents&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Few years ago an engineer in US named Paul Heckel was suing Apple.
He had a couple of software patents in the late 80's for a software
package and then when he saw hypercards and looked at inside &mdash;
this is nothing like my program.  He didn't think any more of it.  But
later on his lawyer explained to him that if you read this patent
carefully hypercards fell into the prohibited area.  So he sued Apple
feeling this is an opportunity to get some money.  Well once when I
give a speech like this, he was in the audience, and he said &ldquo;oh
no that's not true.  I just wasn't aware of the scope of my
protection&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;yeah, that's what I said&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
So you are going to have to spend a lot of time working with a lawyer
and explaining to the lawyer what projects you are working on, so that
the lawyer can explain you what are the patents employed.  This is
going to be expensive and when you're done the lawyer will tell you
something like this: &ldquo;If you do something in this area you are
almost sure to lose a lawsuit.  If you do something in this area you
are in a substantial danger and if you really want to be safe you
better stay out of this area and of course there is a substantial
element of chance in the outcome of any lawsuit&rdquo;.  So now that
you have a predictable terrain for doing business what are you going
to do?
</p>
<p>
Well, you have three options to consider &mdash; you can try to avoid
the patent, you can try to license the patent, or you can try to
challenge its validity in court.  Any one these three is sometimes a
viable alternative and sometimes not.
</p>
<p>
First let's consider avoiding the patent.  Well in some cases that's
is easy.  You know Unisys was frightening people using the patent on
LZW compression which is have to find another data compression
algorithm or we can avoid that patent.  Well, that was somewhat
difficult because there are many other patents covering lots of other
data compression algorithms.  But eventually we found one that was not
in the area that those others' patents cover, eventually we did.  So
that program was implemented. It actually gave better compression
results and so we now have GZIP and a lot of people use GZIP.  So in
that one case it was, there was considerable work and we were able to
do it to avoid that patent.
</p>
<p>
But in the 80's Compuserv defined an image format called GIF and used
LZW compression algorithm in defining it.  Well, of course once the
uproar about the patent become known, people defined another image
format using a different compression algorithm.  They used GZIP
algorithm and that format is called the PNG format which I suppose to
mean that PNG is Not GIF.
</p>
<p>
But there was a problem: lots of people have already started using GIF
format and there were many programs that could display GIF format and
produce GIF format but they couldn't display PNG format.  So the
result was people felt it too hard to switch.  You see when you are
dealing with a data compression program used by somebody who says
&ldquo;I want to compress some data or you can give them a data
compression program&rdquo;.  If he can get sued for using this one and
you give him another one he will switch.
</p>
<p>
But what you want to do is make images that can be displayed by
Netscape, then he can't switch unless Netscape handles the other
format, and it didn't.  It took years, I think, before Netscape
started to handle PNG format.  So people essentially said &ldquo;I
can't switch, I just haven't&rdquo; and so the result was the society
had invested so much in this one format but the inertia was too great
for a switch even now there was another superior format available.
</p>
<p>
So even when a patent is rather narrow, avoiding it can be very hard.
Postscript specifications includes LZW compression which we and our
implementation of a postscript cannot implement.  We supported another
kind of compression in some sense that's not correct even though it
does the useful job.  So even a narrow patent is always feasible to
avoid.
</p>
<p>
Now, sometimes a feature gets patented.  In that case, you can avoid
the patents by taking out that feature.  In the late 80's the users of
the word processor XyWrite got a downgrade in mail.  That word
processor had a feature where you could define a short word or
sequence as an abbreviation.  Whenever you type in that short sequence
and then a space it would turn into a longer expansion.  You could
define this anywhere you write.  Then somebody patented this and
XyWrite decided to deal with the patent by removing the feature.  They
contacted me because in fact I had put a feature like that into the
original Emacs editor back in the 70's &mdash; many years before that
patent.  So there was a chance that I could provide evidence would
enable them to fight the patent.
</p>
<p>
Well, this at least showed me that I had at least one patentable idea
in my life.  I know of it because someone else patented it.  Now, of
course you can respond to these patented features by taking the
features out.  Once your program starts missing several features
that users want, it might be useless as a program.
</p>
<p>
Now you may have heard of Adobe Photoshop.  We have a program called
the GIMP which is more powerful and general than Photoshop.  But there
is a one important feature that it doesn't have which is pantom color
matching, which is very important for people who want actually print
the images on paper and get reliable results.  This feature is omitted
because it is patented.  And as a result, the program for one
substantial class of users is crippled.  If you look at programs today
you see that they often provide many features and what the users
demand is features.  If any important feature is missing, well, it is
easy to leave it out.  But the results may be very bad.
</p>
<p>
Of course, sometimes a patent is so broad that is impossible to avoid
it.  Public key encryption is essential for computer users to have
privacy.  The whole field was patented.  That patent expired just four
years ago, so they could dream now Free Software in the US for public
key encryption.  Until then many programs free and non-free were wiped
out by the Patent Office.  And in fact that the whole area of
computing was held back for more than a decade despite strong
interest.  So, that is the possibility of avoiding the patents.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility that is sometimes available is to license the
patent.  Now the patent holder is not required to offer you a license
that's his.  The patent holder can say &ldquo;I am not licensing this,
you are just out of business.  Period&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
In the League for Programming Freedom we heard in the early 90's from
somebody whose family business was making casino games, computerized
of course, and he had then threatened by somebody who have a patent on
a very broad category of computerized casino games.  The patent
covered a network where there is more than one machine and each
machine support more than one type and they can display more than one
game in progress at time.  Now one thing you should realize is the
patent office thinks that is really brilliant.  If you see that other
people implemented doing one thing and you decided to support two or
more.  You know if they made a system that plays one game and if you
make it able to play more than one game that's an invention.  If you
can display one game and you decided to setup so that display two
games at once that's an invention.
</p>
<p>
If he get with one computer and you do it with network having notebook
computers that's an invention for them.  They think that these steps
are really brilliant.  Of course we in Computer Science know this is
just a rule that we can generalize anything from one to more than one.
So most obvious principle there is.  So every time you write a
subroutine that's what you're doing.  So this is one of the systematic
reasons why the patent system produces and then oppose patents that we
would all say are ridiculously obvious.  You can presume just because
it's ridiculously obvious that they wouldn't be upheld by a court.
They may be legally valid despite the fact that are stupid.  So he was
faced with this patent and the patent holder was not even offering him
the chance to get a license.  &ldquo;Shutdown!&rdquo; &mdash; that's
what the patent holder said, and that's what he eventually did.  He
couldn't afford to fight it.
</p>
<p>
However many patent holders will offer you chance of a license.  But
it cost you dearly.  The owners of the natural order recalculation
patent would be demanding five percent of the gross sales of every
spreadsheet and that I was told was the cheap pre-lawsuit price.  If
you insisted on fighting over the matter they would be charging more.
Now you could, I suppose, sign a license like that for one patent, you
could do it for two, you could do it for three.  For what I think
twenty different patents for your program and each patent holder wants
five percent of the gross sales.  What I have said twenty &mdash; one
of them disagrees, then you are pretty badly screwed.
</p>
<p>
But actually business people tell you that two or three of such patents
would be such a big burden that they would make the company fail in
practice, even if in theory it might have a chance.  So a license
for a patent is not necessarily a feasible thing to do, and for us, the
Free Software developers,  we're in the worst position because we can't
even count the copies and most licenses domain in the field for
copying so that's absolutely impossible for us to use one of these
licenses.  You know that if a license charged one millionth part of a
rupee for each copy, we would be unable to comply because we can't
count the copies.  The total amount of money that I might have in my
pocket, but I can't count it so I can't pay it.  So we suffer some
special burden occasionally.
</p>
<p>
But there are one kind of organizations for which licensing patents
works very well and that is the large multinational corporations and
the reason is that they own many patents themselves and they use them
towards cross licensing.  What does that mean?  Well, essentially the
only defense against patents is deterrence, you have to have patents
of your own.  Then you hope that somebody points a patent you, you
will be able point a patent back and say &ldquo;don't sue me, because
I'll sue you&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
However, deterrence doesn't work as well for patents as it does with
nuclear weapons and the reason is that each patent is pointed in a
fixed direction.  It prohibits certain specified activities.  So the
result is that most of the companies that are trying to get some
patents to defend themselves with.  They have more chance of making a
success.  They might get a few patents that might get a patent that
points there and they might get a patent that points there.  And then
if somebody over here threatens this company what are they going to
do?  They have a patent pointing over there, so they have no defense.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, sooner or later, somebody else will wander over there and
the executive of the company will think &ldquo;gee, we're not as
profitable as I would like, why don't I squeeze some money out
of them&rdquo;.  So they first get this patent for
defensive purposes.  But they often change their minds later when a
victim wants to buy.  And this, by the way, is the fallacy
in the myth that the patent system &ldquo;protects&rdquo; the
&ldquo;small inventor&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Let me tell the message in the myth of the starving genius.  If
somebody who's been working in isolation for years and starving
has a brilliant new idea for how to do something or other.  And so,
now, he's starting a company and he is afraid some big companies like
IBM will compete with him and so he gets a patent and this patent will
&ldquo;protect him&rdquo;.  Well, of course, this is not the way of
things work out in fields.  People won't make this kind of progress in
isolation. It is where you are working with other people and talking with
other people and developing software usually.  And so the whole
scenario doesn't make sense and besides, if there's such a good
computer scientist there is no need for him to starve.  He could have
got a job at any time if he wanted.
</p>
<p>
But let's suppose this happened, and suppose he has this patent, and
he says &ldquo;IBM, you can't compete with me because I have got this
patent &rdquo;.  But here is what IBM says: &ldquo;well, gee, let's
look at your product, hmm, I have this patent, this patent and this
patent and this patent and this patent that your patent is violating.
So how about a quick cross-license?&rdquo;.  And the starving genius
says &ldquo;hmm, I haven't had enough food in my belly to fight these
things, so I better give in&rdquo; and so they sign a cross-license
and now guess what.
</p>
<p>
IBM can compete with him &mdash; he wasn't protected at all.  Now IBM
can do this because they have a lot of patents.  They have patents
pointing here, here, here, everywhere.  So that anybody from almost
anywhere that attacks IBM is facing a stand-off.  A small company
can't do it but a big company can.
</p>
<p>
So IBM brought an article. It was in Think magazine, I believe issue
number five of 1990, that's IBM's own magazine &mdash; an article
about IBM's patent portfolio.  IBM said that they have two kinds of
benefits form its 9000 active U.S patents.  One benefit was collecting
royalties from licenses.  But the other benefit, the bigger benefit,
was access to things patented by others.  From mission to not to be
attacked by others but with their patents through cross licensing.
And the article said that the second benefit was an order of magnitude
greater than the first.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the benefit of IBM is to make it things freely, not
being sued, was ten times the benefit of collecting money from all
their patents.  Now the patent system is lot like a lottery, in that
what happens with any given patent is largely around them and
most of them don't get bring benefits of their owners.  But IBM is so
big that these things average out over the scale of IBM. So you can
say IBM is measuring what the average is like.  What we see is, and
this is a little bit sudden, the benefit of IBM of being able to make
use of ideas patented by others is equal to the harm that the patent
system would have done to IBM if there were no cross licensing.
</p>
<p>
If the IBM were really prohibited from using all those ideas that were
patented by others, so what I said is the harm that the patent system
would do is ten times the benefit, on the average.  Now, for IBM
though, this harm doesn't happen. Because IBM does have 9000 patents
and thus forces licenses and cross-licenses and avoids the problem.
But if you were small, then you can't avoid the problem that way and
you will really be facing ten time as much trouble as benefit.
Anyway, this is why the big multinational corporations are in favor
of software patents and they are lobbying governments around the world
to adopt software patents and saying naive things like &ldquo;this is
a new kind of monopoly for software developers that has to be good for
them, right?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Well, today, after you have heard my speech I hope you understand why
that isn't true.  You have to look carefully at how patents affect
software developers to see whether they are good or bad, and
explaining that is my overall purpose.
</p>
<p>
So, that is the possibility of licensing a patent.  The third possible
option is to go to court and challenge the validity of the patent.
Now the outcome of this case will depend largely on technicalities,
which means essentially on randomness.
</p>
<p>
You know, the dice were rolled a few years ago and you can investigate
and find out what the dice came up saying and then you will find out
you have got a chance.  So its mainly historical accident that
determines whether the patent is valid.  The historical accident of
whether precisely which things people happen to publish and when.  So,
sometimes, there is a possibility of invalidating.  So even if a
patent is ridiculously trivial sometimes there is a good chance of
invalidating and sometimes there is not.
</p>
<p>
You can't expect the courts to recognize that it is trivial, because
their standards are generally much lower than we would think are
sensible.  In fact, in the United States, this is been a persistent
tendency.  I saw a supreme court decision from something like 1954
which had a long list of patents that were invalidated by the Supreme
Court starting in the 1800's.  And they were utterly ridiculous like
making a shape of door-knob out of rubber when previously they've been
made out of wood.  And this decision rebuked the patent system for
going far far away from the proper standards, and they just keep on
doing it.
</p>
<p>
So you can expect sensible results from that, but there are situations
where when you look at the past record, you see there is a chance to
invalidate a certain patent.  It is worth the try, at least to
investigate.  But the actual court case is likely to be extremely
expensive.
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, one defendant lost and had to pay 13 million dollars
of which most went to the lawyers on the two sides.  I think only 5
million dollars was actually taken away by the patent holder and so
then there were 8 million to the lawyers.
</p>
<p>
Now, these are your possible options.  At this point, of course, you
have to write the program.  And there the problem is that you face
this situation not just once but over and over and over because
programs today are complicated.  Look at a word processor; you'll see
a lot of features.  Many different things each of which could be
patented by somebody, or a combination of two of them could be
patented by somebody.  British Telecom has a patent in US on the
combination of following hypertext links and letting the users dial up
through a phone line.  Now these are two basically separate things,
but the combination of the two is patented.
</p>
<p>
So, that means if there are a 100 things in your program there are
potentially some five thousand copairs of two that might be patented
by somebody already and there is no law against patenting a
combination of three of them either.  So that's just the features, you
know, there are going to be many techniques that you use in writing
the programs, many algorithms they could be patented too.  So there
are lots and lots of things that could be patented and the result is
that developing a program becomes like crossing a field of land mines.
Sure, each step probably will not step on a patent, chances are it
will be safe.  But crossing a whole field becomes dangerous.
</p>
<p>
The best way for a nonprogrammer to understand what this is like is to
compare the writing of these large programs with another area in which
people write something &mdash; very large symphonies.  Imagine if the
governments of Europe in the 1700's had wanted to promote progress in
symphonic music by adopting a system of music patents.  So that any
idea that could be described in words could be patented if it seem to
be new and original.  So you'd be able to patent, say your three note
melodic motive which is too short to be but it would have been
patentable and may they could have patented a certain chord
progression and maybe patented using a certain combination of
instruments playing at the same time or any other idea that somebody
could describe.
</p>
<p>
Well, by 1800 there would have been thousands of these music idea
patents.  And then imagine that you are Beethoven and you want to
write a symphony.  To write a whole symphony, you are going to have to
do lots of different things and at any point you could be using an
idea that somebody else has patented.  Of course, if you do that,
he'll say &ldquo;oh! You are just a thief, why can't you write
something original&rdquo;.  Well Beethoven had more than his share of
new musical ideas.  But he used a lot of existing musical ideas.  He
had to, because that is the only way to make it recognizable.  If you
don't do that, people won't listen at all.  Pierre Boulez thought he
was going to totally reinvent the language of music and he tried and
nobody listens to it because it doesn't use all the ideas that they
were familiar with.  So you have to use the old ideas that other
people have thought of.
</p>
<p>
Nobody is such a genius that he can reinvent the entire field of
software and do useful things without learning anything from anybody
else.  So in effect, those people were patent holders and their
lawyers, they were accusing us of being cheaters because we don't
totally reinvent the field from scratch.  We have to build on previous
work to make progress and that is exactly what the patent system is
prohibits us from doing.  We have to provide features that the users
are accustomed to and can recognize where they'll find our software
just too difficult to use no matter how good it is.
</p>
<p>
Now, people sometimes ask me why is software different from other
fields.  Sometimes, of course they ask this in a rather nasty fashion,
they say the other fields can deal with patents why should software be
an exception?  Now that's a nasty way of putting it because its making
the assumption that it is wrong to want to escape from a problem.  I
could imagine I am saying when other people could get cancer, why
shouldn't you?  Clearly, if it is a problem, enabling any field to
escape is good.  But it is a good and serious question &ldquo;are
these fields in the same issue&rdquo;?  The patents affect all these
fields the same way?  Is the right policy for the software the same as
the right policy for automobile engines or pharmaceuticals or chemical
processes, you know, this is a serious question which is worth looking
at.  When you look at it, what you see is that the relationship
between patents and products varies between the fields.
</p>
<p>
At one extreme you have pharmaceuticals were typically a whole
chemical formula is patented.  So if you come up with a new drug then
its not patented by somebody else.  At the other extreme is software
were when you write a new program, you are combining dozens or
hundreds of ideas and we can't expect them all to be new.  Even in an
innovative program which has the few new ideas has to use lots and
lots of old ideas too.  And in between you find the other fields.
Even in other fields, you can get patent deadlocks.
</p>
<p>
When the United States entered the World War I, nobody in the US could
make a modern airplane.  And the reason was that modern airplanes use
several different techniques that were patented by different companies
and the owners hated each other.  So nobody could get a license to use
all these patents.  Well, the US Government decided that this was an
unacceptable state of affairs and essentially, paid those patent
holders a lump sum and said we have nationalized these patents and now
everybody go make airplanes for us.  But the amount to which this
happens, the frequency and the seriousness of it varies according to
how many different ideas go in one product.  It varies according to
how many points of patent vulnerability there are in one product.  And
in that question, software is at the extreme.
</p>
<p>
It's not unusual of for a few people working for a couple of years to
write a program that could have a million parts in it, different parts
which is maybe, say 300,000 lines of code.  To design a physical
system that has a million different parts, that's a major project,
that's very rare.  Now you find many times people make a physical
object with a million parts, but its typically many copies of the same
subunit and that's much easier to design &mdash; that's not a million
parts in the design.  Now, so, why is this?
</p>
<p>
The reason is that in other fields people have to deal with the
propensity of matter.  When you are designing circuits or cars or
chemicals, you have to face the fact that these physical substances
will do what they do, not what they are supposed to do.  We in
software don't have that problem and that makes it tremendously
easier.  We are designing a collection of idealized mathematical parts
which have definitions.  They do exactly what they are defined to do.
</p>
<p>
And so there are many problems we don't have.  For instance, if we put
an if statement inside a while statement, we don't have to worry about
whether the if statement can get enough power to run at the speed its
going to run.  We don't have to worry about whether it would run at a
speed that would generates radio frequency interference in it and
induces wrong values in some other parts of the data.  We don't have
to worry about whether it would loop at a speed that causes resonance
and eventually the if statement will vibrate against the while
statement and one of them will crack.  We don't have to worry that
chemicals in the environment will get into the boundary between the if
statement and the while statement and corrode them and cause a bad
connection.
</p>
<p>
We don't have to worry other chemicals would get on them and cause
short-circuit.  We don't have to worry about whether the heat can be
dissipated from the if statement through the surrounding while
statement.  We don't have to worry about whether the while statement
would cause so much of voltage drop and the if statement so that the
if statement won't function correctly.  When you look at the value of
a variable you don't have to worry about whether you've referenced
that variable so many times that you exceed the fan out limit.  You
don't have to worry about how much capacitance there is in a certain
variable and how much time it will take to store the value in it.
</p>
<p>
All these things are defined a way and the system is defined to
function in a certain way and it always does.  The physical computer
might not function, but that's not the programs fault.  So because of
all these problems we don't have to deal with, our field is
tremendously easier.  If you assume that the intelligence of
programmers is the same as the intelligence of mechanical engineers,
electrical engineers and chemical engineers and so on, what's going to
happen.  Those of us with the easiest field, fundamentally, are going
to push it further.  We make bigger and bigger the things and
eventually it becomes hard again.
</p>
<p>
And that's why we can develop much bigger systems than people in the
other fields.  They just have these hard problems to deal with all the
time.
</p>
<p>
In the other fields, it may be necessary to develop an idea, you may
have the idea but then you may have to try out lots of different ways
to get it work at all.  In software now, like that, you have the idea
and what you go and do is write a program which uses this idea and
then the users may like it or not.  And if they don't like it,
probably you can just fix some details and get it to work.  There is
another problem that we don't have to worry about &mdash;
manufacturing of copies.
</p>
<p>
Well, when we put the if statement inside the while statement, we
don't have to worry about how the if statement is going to be inserted
into the while statement as a copy is being built.  We don't have to
worry either about making sure we have access to remove and replace
the if statement if it should burn out.  So all we have to do is take
copy in its all purpose copy anything facility.  People making
physical recruitment and physical products they can do that these
things has to be built piece by piece each time.  The result is that
for them, the cost of designing a system of certain complexity may be
(gesturing) this much and the factory may take this much to set up.
So they have to deal with this much with the patent system, it's a
level of overhead they can live with.
</p>
<p>
For us, designing it may cost (gesturing) this much and manufacturing
it may cost this much, so this much overhead from the patent system is
crushing.  Another way to look at it is that because we can, a few of
us can, make a much bigger system, there are many more points of
vulnerability where somebody might have patented something already.
</p>
<p>
We have to walk a long distance through the mine field where they they
only have to walk a few feet through the minefield.  So its much more
of a dangerous system for us.  Now, you have to realize that the
extensible purpose of the patent system is to promote progress.  This
is something that is often forgotten because the companies that
benefit from patents like to distract you from it.  They like to give
you the idea that patents exist because they deserves special
treatment.  But this is not what the patent system says.
</p>
<p>
Patent system says, the goal is to promote progress for the society.
By encouraging certain behavior like publishing new ideas and after
certain &mdash; originally that was fairly short &mdash; time,
everyone could use them.  Of course there is a certain price that the
society pays as well and we have to ask the question which is bigger
&mdash; the benefit or the price.  Well, in other fields, I am not
sure.  I am not an expert on other fields of engineering, I've never
done them and I don't know whether having patents is good for progress
in those fields.
</p>
<p>
I have been in software since before software patents existed and I
know that software patents do a lot of harm and essentially no good.
In the old days, ideas came along, either people in a university had
an idea or somebody had an idea what he was working on developing a
software.  And either way, these ideas got published and then everyone
could use them.  Now why did the software publishers publish these
ideas?  Because they knew that the big job was writing the program.
</p>
<p>
They knew that publishing the ideas would get them credit from the
community and meanwhile anybody else who wanted to compete with them
would still have to write a program, which is the big job.  So they
typically kept the details of the program secret, of course some of us
think that it is wrong, but that is a different issue they kept the
details of the program secret and they publish the ideas and meanwhile
the software development because software development is going on that
provided the field with a steady stream of ideas so ideas were not the
limiting factor.
</p>
<p>
The Limiting factor was the job of writing programs that would work
and that people would like using.  So, in effect, applying the patent
system to software focuses on facilitating a thing which is not the
limiting factor while causing trouble for the thing which is the
limiting factor.  You see the software patents encourage somebody to
have an idea but at the same time they encourage people to restrict
its use, so in fact we are actually worse off now in terms of having
ideas we could use, because in the past people have the ideas and
publish them and we could use them and now they have the ideas and
patented them and we can't use them for twenty years.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time, the real limiting factor &mdash; which is developing
the programs &mdash; this is hampered by software patents because of
other dangers I explained to you in the first half of this talk.  So
the result is that while the system is supposed to be promoting
progress in software actually it is so screwed up its just obstructing
progress.
</p>
<p>
Today we have some economic research showing Mathematically how this
can happen.  You can find it in www.researchoninnovation.org and I am
not completely sure of the name of the paper, but its one that shows
that in a field where incremental innovation is typical.  Having a
patent system can result in slower progress.  In other words the
system produces counter intuitive results that are the opposite of
what it was intended to do.  This backs up the intuitive conclusion of
every programmer who sees that software patents are absurd.
</p>
<p>
So, what can a country do to avoid this problem?  Well, there are two
approaches, one is to address the problem at the issue of granting
patents, and the other is to approach it at the point where the
patents are being enforced.  Doing this at the stage of granting
patents is not quite as easy as you might think, now I have been
talking about software patents but strictly speaking you can't
classify patents into hardware patents and software patents because
one patent might cover both hardware and software so in fact my
definition of a software patent is a patent that can restrict software
development.  And if you look at many software patents you can often
find that the system may describe has a large part of the computer
itself as a part of the description of what's going on, that's a great
way of making the whole thing seem complicated when it is really
trivial.  So its the way they can get the patent office to decide it
is unobvious.  But there is a different criterion that can be used, a
slightly different place to draw the line that still does a reasonable
job and that is between processes that transforms matter in a specific
way and processes where the result is just calculation and display of
information or a combination of data processing and display steps
where others are put it as mental steps being carried out by
equipment.
</p>
<p>
There are various ways of formulating this, but more or less
equivalent.  Now this is not exactly the same as prohibiting software
patents, because in some cases computers are used as a part of
specific physical equipment to make it do a specific thing.  And
software patents might be allowed if they are part of a specific
physical activity.  But that's not really a disaster, after all once
people are involved in a specific physical activity or a specific
physical product, they are bringing into their home business all those
complexities of dealing with matter.  So its more like those other
fields of engineering, may be its okay to have patents on that narrow
kind of software.
</p>
<p>
As long as we can keep the core areas of the software, the purely
software activities safe from patents we have solved the bulk of the
problem.  So that is a feasible approach and that's what people are
working towards in Europe.  However that is not going to be any use in
the United States because United States already has tens of thousands
and probably hundreds of thousands of software patents.  Any change in
the criterion for issuing patents does not help at all with the
patents that already exists.
</p>
<p>
So what I propose to the United States is to change the criteria for
applying patents to say that purely software systems running on
general purpose computing hardware are immune from patents.  They by
definition cannot infringe a patent and this way patents can still be
granted exactly the way they are now and they can still in the formal
sense cover both hardware implementations and software implementations
as they do now.  But software would be safe.
</p>
<p>
That's the solution I propose to the US, but it could be used in other
countries as well.  Now, one of the tremendous dangers facing most
countries today is the World Trade Organization, which sets up a
system of corporate regulated trade &mdash; not free trade as its
proponents like to call it, but corporate regulated trade.  It
replaces regulation of trade by governments that are somewhat
democratic and might listen to the interest of their citizens with
regulation of trade by businesses which don't pretend to listen to the
citizens.  So it is fundamentally antidemocratic and ought to be
abolished.
</p>
<p>
But it is crucial to note that the part of the GATT agreement which
deals with patents does not require software patents.  Many experts
who have studied this in Europe makes this claim and the reason is
that they interpret technical affect as there is a specific physical
consequences for physical system going on.  And the software vector
doesn't do that, doesn't have to be, in the domains that the patents
can cover.  So at least you don't have to worry about the Word Trade
Organization causing problems here despite the tremendous problems
they cause in other areas of life.
</p>
<p>
Preventing India from software patents here will be up to you &mdash;
to the citizens of India.  I am a foreigner, I have no influence
except when I can convince other people through the logic of what I
say.  There is a chance that you can do this.  When US started to have
software patents the public policy question was not considered at all.
Nobody even asked whether it was a good idea to have software patents.
The Supreme Court made a decision which was then twisted around by an
appeals court and ever since then there was software patents.
</p>
<p>
But when Europe started to consider officially authorizing software
patents a few years ago, public opposition started to rise and became
so strong that the politicians and the parties began paying attention
to it.  And started saying that they were against it.  In fact two
attempts to authorize software patents have been blocked already in
Europe.  The French Minister of Industry says that the software
patents would be a disaster and under no circumstances should they be
allowed in France.  Over the German political parties have taken a
stand against the software patents.
</p>
<p>
The battle is not yet over, you know, we have not conclusively blocked
software patents in Europe because the multinational companies and
their servant, the United States government, is lobbying very hard and
they have ignorance on their side it is so easy for somebody with a
naive near-liberal view to be persuaded that new kind of monopoly has
to be good.
</p>
<p>
You have to look at the details of how software patents affect
software development to see that they cause problem.  You have to
study that economic research in its Mathematics in order to see why
you shouldn't assume that patents always promote progress.  So it is
easy for IBM to centre someone and say you should really adopt
software patents, they are great for programming and look US is ahead
in when US has software patents if you have software patents too you
might catch up.  You can get more dominant and &mdash; when US was
ahead in computers before it had software patents, it can't be because
of software patents.  It is important to understand that each country
has its own patent systems and its own patent laws and what you do in
a certain country under the jurisdiction of that country's patent law.
So the result is that if the US has software patents the US becomes a
sort of battleground where anybody using computer might get sued.
</p>
<p>
If India avoid software patents then India is not a battleground, and
computer users in India do not face this danger of getting sued.  So
it turns out that each country will issue patents to foreigners just
as to its own citizens.  So in fact in a place which has this idea of
software patents foreigners can own those patents there are lots of
non-US companies that own US software patents so they all welcome to
get involved in the fighting in the US.  Of course is we Americans to
suffer become the victims of this.  Meanwhile in India if there are no
software patents that means Indian companies and foreign companies are
prevented from coming to India and attacking people with software
patents.
</p>
<p>
So, yes it is important that each countries has its own patents for
that makes big difference but you can't understand what difference it
makes.  Having software patents in a certain country is not an
advantage for developers in that country.  It is a problem for anybody
distributing and using software in that country.  Now, if you in India
are developing a program for use in US you may face the problem or
your client may face the problem of US software patents.  At least
probably you can get sued here.
</p>
<p>
The client who commissioned the program and tried to use it might get
sued in the US and indeed you will have to deal with the problem, the
US is problem when you try doing business in the US.  But at least you
will be safe here you know at least it is a big difference between
your client got sued because your client told you to make a product
and that product is patented versus you get sued for making that
product.
</p>
<p>
If there are software patents in India you will get sued.  Wheas in
the current situation at least you can say to the client &ldquo;well,
we did our job you told us to make this and we made it and so, I am
sorry this happened to you but this is not our fault&rdquo;.  If there
are software patents in India you get sued yourself and there is
nothing you can say about that.
</p>
<p>
So the ultimate conclusion is that software patents tie all software
developers, all computer users and essentially all businesses in new
kind of bureaucracy which serves no beneficial social purpose.  So
that is a bad policy and it should be avoided.  Businesses don't like
bureaucracy.  If businesses knew that they were threatened with a new
kind of bureaucracy they would have opposed software patents very
strongly.  But most of them aren't aware of this.
</p>
<p>
In the US software patents have led directly to business method
patents.  What does this mean?  A business method is basically haw you
make decisions about what to do in the business.  And in the past
these decisions were made by humans but now sometimes they are made by
computers and that means they are carried out by software and that
means decision policies can be patented.  So software patents implied
business method patents and business procedure patents.  So the result
is that any business could find itself, you know, once they decide
&ldquo;we're going to automate the way we carry out our
procedures&rdquo; but now they can get sued with software patents.  So
if the businesses only knew they would be organizing through things
like the chamber of commerce to demand opposition to software patents.
</p>
<p>
But most of them don't know and therefore it is going to be your job
to inform them.  Make sure that they understand the danger that they
are facing.  And then India may be able with the help from other
countries like France and Germany to reject software patents.  It is
important for the people in the Indian Government to make contact with
officials in European countries so that this battle against software
patents doesn't have to be fought at one country at a time, countries
can work together to adopt an intelligent policy.  May be there should
be a no software patents treaty that various countries can sign and
promise each other aid when they are threatened by economic pressure
from the United States as part of its economic imperialism.
</p>
<p>
Because United States likes to do that, you know, one of the
provisions in the GATT agreement is that the countries have the right
to make compulsory licenses for making medicines to address a public
health crisis.  And the South African Government proposed to do this
for medicine against AIDS.  South Africa has a very bad problem with
AIDS the figures I heard was that a quarter of the adult population is
infected.  And of course, most of them can't afford to buy these
medicines at the prices charged by the US companies.
</p>
<p>
So the South African Government was going to issue compulsory license
which even under GATT is allowed to do, but US Government threatened
economic sanctions.  Vice President Gore was directly involved with
this and then he'd be facing the presidential election he realized
that this was going to look bad and so he dropped out of the effort.
But this kind of the thing is what the US Government does all the time
with regard to patents and copyrights.  They only mind if people get
patented to death.  So it is important for countries to work together
against this.
</p>
<p>
For more information about the problems of software patents see
www.progfree.org and www.ffii.org.  And there is also a petition to
sign, www.knowepatents.org.
</p>
<p>
Please talk with all executives of businesses &mdash; any kind of
businesses &mdash; about this issue.  Make sure that they understand
the extend of the problem they face and they think of going to
business organizations to have them lobby against software patents.
</p>

<h3>Questions from the audience</h3>

<p>Now I'll answer  questions.</p>
<p>
Oh, by the way any journos over here, I would recommend writing
articles about software patents separately, from articles about free
software.  If you cover them in one article together, people may get
the idea that software patents are only bad for the free software
developers and they are okay for other software developers.
</p>
<p>
This is not true, if you think back of what I have said, hardly any of
it relates to the question of whether the programs are free or not,
the dangers of the same for all software developers.  So please don't
take the risk, the people will get confused, write separate articles.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, you said that companies like IBM are harmed 10
times as much as they benefit?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No.  What I said is the harm that would had happened to
them is 10 times the benefit, but this harm is purely theoretical, it
doesn't occur.  You see, they avoid it through cross-licensing.  So in
fact, the harm does not happen.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: But it is only neutralized, they don't really benefit?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, they do, you see, because, the bare aspect they
avoid through cross licensing and meanwhile they do collect money from
some other licensees.  So they are benefiting in total.  There is the
small benefit which happens and the big potential harm which does not
happen.  So you have zero plus something for the benefit.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: But for that something will oppose this movement against
patents?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Right, IBM favors software patents.  I had trouble one,
I couldn't hear all the words in your sentence.  I don't know whether
there was a &lsquo;not&rsquo; in it.  I couldn't tell, there are two
diametrically opposite meanings for what you have said, so what you
can do is make sure that the situation is clear.  IBM favors software
patents, IBM thinks it stands to gain a lot from software patents.  So
what it stands to gain is that the IBM and the other very big
companies would basically control software development, because it
will be very hard to do independent software development.
<p>
To develop nontrivial programs you're going to have to infringe
patents of IBMs. Now if you are big and often lucky enough, you might
have some patents of your own and make IBM cross-license with
you.  Otherwise you are completely at their mercy and you have to hope
that they just let you pay the money.</p>
<p>
Is someone else asking?</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, what was the reason for the development of the
software patent?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, in the US, there was no reason, somebody tried to
get a patent, that was a software patent, and, I think, the patent
office said no, so he took it to court and eventually went to the
supreme court and they, they didn't judge it as a public policy
question, they judged it in terms of what did the law say.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So was it not the realization that &hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Sorry, I can't &hellip; could you try to pronounce your
consonants more clearly, I'm having trouble understanding the
words.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So was it not the realization that copyright is
notoriously weak for protecting software?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Copyright is not only what?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Notoriously weak&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, I think the whole sentence is not sensible, I
don't understand the term protecting software, and I don't agree with
you.
<p>
Most programmers don't agree with you.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So when you are saying that you are not favoring
protection of software and you yourself is giving General Public
License, where do you get that power to issue General Public
License?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: OK, you are asking questions about copyright and Free
Software which is not the topic now, I will accept questions about
that later on, but I gave the speech about software patents and i want
to answer questions about software patents.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir I have a question about software patents, the thing
is that how can one protect where there is a functional element
&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Protect what?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Functional element&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: What is gonna happen to them?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, how can we get a protection when there is a&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Protection from what?  Somebody gonna come with a gun?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: No Sir &hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Basically the protection you need is the protection
against being sued for the program you wrote, programmers need
protection from software patents.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: No it is not the programmers themselves sir, they are
companies who have invested in something?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: And you what the company get sued because in your large
program there are five different things that somebody, that five
different people already patented.  Now its clear to see the myth that
you are operating on, its the naive idea that when you develop the
program you will have the patent.  Well, the idea, that very statement
contains a mistake because there is no such thing as &lsquo;will
patent&rsquo; when you develop a program with many different things in
it, there are many things each of which might be patented by somebody
else already, and you find out about them one by one when they come to
you saying either &ldquo;pay us a lot of money or else shut
down&rdquo; and when you duel with five of them you never know when
number six is going to come along.  It's much safer to be in the
software field if you know you are not going to get sued as long as
you wrote the program yourself.
<p>
That's the way was before software patents &mdash; if you wrote the
program yourself there is nothing to sue you about.  Today you can
write the program yourself, it may even be an useful and innovative
program but because you didn't reinvent the whole field, you use some
ideas that were already known, other people sue you.  Of course, those
people who wanna go around suing you, they are going to pretend that
this extortion is protection for them, protection from what,
protection from having competitors, I guess, they don't believe in
competition, they want monopolies.</p>
<p>
Well, to hell with them.  It's not good for the public that they
should get what they want, this is the question of public policy.  We
have to decide what is good for the citizens generally.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Audience</b>: [applause]</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Not have somebody saying &ldquo;I wanna have a monopoly
because I think I am so important, so I should have one, so protect me
from anybody else being allowed to develop software&rdquo;.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: You are suggesting that we should avoid making a
battleground for patency, don't we still have to see the problem that
there are a lot of American products being sold here and&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: &hellip; and we are still going to be
mistaken&hellip;?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No!  No, you misunderstood, US developers may be in
trouble because of the patent system and what effect will that have,
it means that their certain products that wouldn't be coming from the
US and therefore they wouldn't be sold in the US or here.  You see, if
the developer is in the US and there is a US software patent, that
software developer is going to get sued there, whether or not he tries
with anybody in India he is going to get sued.  But the fact that he
is distributing the program in India is not going to cause him an
additional problem because that is under the jurisdiction of India,
that's the one thing he will not get sued for.  So, basically, what it
means is whatever exists can be distributed in India, safely, and the
developers who are lucky enough to be in India would be safe from this
kind of gang warfare, and those who are unlucky enough to be in the US
will not be safe.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, are you basically against the very concept of
intellectual property rights?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: As I said in the beginning, it is foolish even to think
about that topic, that topic is an overgeneralization.  It lumps
together totally different things like copyrights and patents and so
any opinion about co-intellectual property is a foolish one.  I don't
have an opinion about intellectual property, I have opinions about
copyrights and I have completely different opinions about patents and
even in the area of patents, know, I have different opinions in
different fields.  Even that area is a big area.  And then their
trademarks which are also called intellectual property, I think
trademarks are basically a good idea.
<p>
The US has taken trademarks all little too far.  But, basically it is
reasonable to have labels that you can rely on.  So you shouldn't try
to have an opinion about intellectual property.  If you are thinking
about intellectual property, you are thinking at a simplistic level.
And any conclusions you reach will be simplistic.  So do as I do, you
know, pick one topic at a time and focus on it and find out the
details about that one area, then you can think intelligently about
that area and later on you can think intelligently about the other
areas too.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So there is an argument that if particular intellectual
property right is not protected&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry, what you are saying makes no sense at all and
is at a foolish general level&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Let me complete sir, if that particular intellectual
property right is not protected, it may impede the investment, and
this impediment&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: This generalistic thinking is so simplistic, it's
totally stupid.  It makes no sense at all.  There is no principle of
intellectual property.  Copyrights and patents and trademarks
originated completely separately, they have nothing in common, except
later somebody else made up this term &ldquo;intellectual
property&rdquo; to call them all while.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, will you extend this concept to the physical
property?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No, I'm sorry, none of these things has anything to do
with the physical property rights, they are totally different.  What
do you say extend &ldquo;this concept&rdquo;?  Which is this
&ldquo;concept&rdquo;?  The idea that the term &ldquo;intellectual
property&rdquo; is a generalization that leads you into simplistic
thinking.  Should we apply that to physical property?  No, they are
totally different.  They have nothing in common.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So the basis under which this intellectual property is
protected is &ldquo;protect the labor&rdquo;, &ldquo;intellectual
labor&rdquo;?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No!  No, you are totally wrong, you are totally wrong.
The purpose of you have been brainwashed, you have been listening to
the propaganda of the companies that want to have these monopolies.
If you ask what legal scholars say is the basis of these systems.
They say that their attempts, for copyrights and for patents, their
attempts to manipulate the behavior of people to get benefit for the
public.  Trademarks are a different issue, I think the issues for
trademark are completely different.  So you are making an
overgeneralisation also.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So why can't we extend the very same principle
&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: But in any case, your principle is wrong and if you take
a look at that economic research on www.researchoninnovation.org you
will see that you are making naive statements, naive blind statements
that are simply not true.  You got the silly idea that creating a
monopoly over some aspect of life always invariably makes that aspect
of life thrive.  Well this is dumb.  Occasionally it might work, and
occasionally it causes a lot of troubles.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Don't you think that the same kind of monopoly is
created in favor of a party when he owns a physical property?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry, I can't hear you.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, don't you think that the same kind of monopoly
rights are created if a particular physical property is allowed to be
owned by a person, just like an intellectual property?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Physical property can only be in one place at a time,
you know, only one person can sit in a chair at a time in the normal
way.  You know these are totally different issues, you know trying to
generalize to the utmost is a foolish thing to do, you are doing with
complicated words that have many, many, many complicated details and
you are asking us to ignore all these details and you are doing with
words that have complicated effects in various fields and you are
asking us to ignore the details of their effects.  Don't bother
judging this program by its results.  I think that if we were talking
about a public policy issue, we got to look at the actual results of
the policy, not some myths to what results a certain ideology would
predict, I'm telling you the real results, I'm telling you what I have
seen and what other programmers have seen.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, what about the LZW patent? Is it &hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>:  What about the &lsquo;what&rsquo;?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: LZW patent?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: The LZW patent?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yeah. Is it still in effect?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yes, it is. Well, there are two LZW patents as I
explained to you and they are both still in effect.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, so its for 20 years?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yeah, it's not 20 years yet.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, can we reduce the scope of the problem by reducing
the period of the patent?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Definitely, you could.  If there were software patents,
but they only lasted for, say, 5 years or three years, that would
mostly solve the problem.  Yes it's a pain to have to wait 3 or 5
years, but it's much, much less of a pain.  But, but there is a
difficulty there.  The GATT agreements say that patents must last 20
years.  So the only way you could have something like a software
pattern which lasted for 3 or 5 years is as follows.
<p>
First, make it clear that ordinary patents do not apply and second, if
you wish you could create this different system of five-year software
idea monopolies.  Well, it's not clear that there is any particular
benefit in this five-year software monopolies but it would be much
better in the current situation.  So if you found the government
prepared to make this deal, well, I would say, we should take it. But,
but we have to realize, though, that the first step is to abolish
software patents strictly speaking, and that has to be part of this
deal.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So and patent has also now become victim of
&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, could you speak louder?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, patent has now become a way of making money by
businesses rather than promoting inventions?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yes, a lot of them use it that way.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So, sir, can we reduce this problem further by assigning
the patent to the actual inventor rather than a business&hellip;?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Not really.  What you find is that, that aspect of the
relationship between the employee and the business is something that
gets negotiated and the business has more cloud, so they are always
going in the end of ranging to have the employee and the patent of the
company.  The other thing is that it doesn't make a big difference who
owns the patent.  The point is that you are prohibited from developing
a program using that idea and it may make some difference precisely
who has the power to sue you.  But what you really want is not to be
sued on.  So why look for a half measure like this?  Or its much
better just to say that software shouldn't have patents?
<p>
Okay, if you gonna pass a note, you better read it out loud.  Any
other questions?</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: People who are being to Malaysia say that, if we buy a
PC there, the amount of money we would pay for all the standard
software is about a tenth of what we should pay in this country.  In
Malaysia they are little more relaxed about patents and
copyrights?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, are you not sure what you are talking about, you
seem to mixing together copyrights and patents, I'm not sure what you
are talking about has anything to do with the issue of software
patents.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Precisely what I want to know is about&hellip; this is
something to do with patents&hellip;?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Probably not.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Different countries depending on how much, whether they
are part of WTO or not part of WTO &hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No, no.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: &hellip;I think matter&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: You see, I don't know for certain because I don't know
what's going on their either, I'd never been there but I suspect that
it's a matter of copyrights and has nothing to do with patents,
because if you are talking about the same programs, remember, software
patents are primarily a restriction on software developers.  So it's
the same program that was developed, say, in the US, the patent
problems they have are independent of, you know, the patent problems
they have are biggest in the US, not in either India or Malaysia, so,
that probably has to do with copyrights not patents and that's a
totally different issue, we mustn't lump these issues together.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir earlier you've told that&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry I can't hear you.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Earlier in your speech you've told that software that
should be brought under the purvey of patents&hellip; is what you
defined that as what can be run on a general purpose machine.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm afraid I can't &hellip; can anyone understand what
he's saying ? I cannot understand your words.  If you make an attempt
to enunciate more clearly I may be able to understand.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: You had spoken earlier that software that should be
patented is, you defined that as, software that can be run on a
general purpose machine&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry I didn't say that software should be patented,
so I just cant make out these words.  Maybe if you tell that to
someone else, the other person could say it I could understand.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Software patents, like whatever you call software
patents, like those are what can be run on a general purpose machine.
So if some algorithm or some piece of software is capable of being
executed on a general purpose machine, it should not be patented.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yes.  Now I can hear you, yes.  One of the things I
proposed was that patent should not apply to software for general
purpose machines or the use of it on those general purpose machines.
So that if you develop that program or if you are using that program
you couldn't be sued.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: We've an increasing number of software now being run on
a general purpose machine.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, then that would be covered still by software
patents so there wouldn't be a total a solution, but at least there
would be a partial solution.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So if the defining line is general purpose machines,
don't you see there's a possibility that people could find loopholes
in it, like, to find or workarounds for&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry do I see a possibility for people would do
what?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: &hellip;of finding loopholes or workarounds of
converting what you would call software patents into get it actually
patented.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry I do not understand.  Loopholes to do&hellip;
I'm sorry.  What people would do, what software developers would do in
that situation is use general purpose machines more.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Some algorithm can be run on a general purpose machine
&mdash; what I'd say that that algorithm I'm using it for some
embedded device and go ahead and patent it.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Why you could try it, you misunderstood.  The point is
that, you misunderstood what the solution is.  The solution is that if
I'm using in developing the software on general purpose machines then
nobody can sue me for patent infringement.  So yes, somebody could get
a patent and may be he could sue others who are doing specialized
things which involve particular hardware.  But they couldn't sue
me.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Excuse me sir, may I ask a question.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yes.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, you spoke of general purpose machines. In the
sense, how would you define these machines, because these days you
have a lot of custom made handheld devices etc.  Now some
way&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No, hand held computers are general purpose when they
are not designed to carry out a specific computation or a specific
physical process.  They're general purpose computers.  They have
general purpose computer chips in them.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Then the idea would be contestable in a court of law as
together it's a general purpose&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I guess, what has to be, yeah.  The precise details of
drawing these lines, one ends up having to leave to judges.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Thank you sir.</dt>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Germany and France, the only countries who has said no
to patents in Europe&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, I don't know the full situation.  Those are the
just the ones I know of.  The last time there was a vote there were
going to be a majority of no votes, and so they dropped the issue.
And I don't remember the other countries.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: There's no European community decision on
this&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Not yet.  In fact, the European Commission itself is
divided.  One of the agencies &mdash; the one which unfortunately is
the lead agency on this issue &mdash; has been won over by
multinationals and is in favor of software patents and then the
agency that's trusted to encourage software development is against
them, and so they're trying to work against it.  So somebody who want
to get in touch with the official incharge of the agency that is
opposed to software patents, I can put them in touch.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Is there any country that said &lsquo;no&rsquo; to
software patents?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, there are countries which don't have them, but
it's not clear that there's any country which has affirmed this
recently.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, could you please elaborate on the benefits the
software development community got in European countries from this
policy?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, the benefit is you don't have to be afraid someone
will sue you because of some of the ideas were a combination of the
ideas that you used in a program you wrote.  Basically software
patents mean that if you write a program, somebody else might sue you
and say you're not allowed to write that program.  The benefits of not
having software patents is you're from that.
<p>
Now in India you've probably taken for granted that you're safe from
that.  But that will only long as long as they're no software patents
in India.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Are there any threats to India not acceding to software
regime?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well there's no software regime.  The GATT agreement
doesn't require software patents.  There's no treaty requiring
software patents.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Most people, if they had a chance to get a patent and
make a lot of money out of it, they wouldn't pass it up&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, many people if they had a chance to get a gun and
make a lot of money of it wouldn't pass it up.
<p>
The point is, therefore, let me try not to hand them that opportunity.
You know, since we don't have a government agency handing out guns to
people on the street we should not have a government agency handing out
software patents to people on the street either.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Being an advocate of this non-patency, have you ever
faced any&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm having trouble hearing you.  Please try to make an
effort to pronounce every sound clearly that I might understand.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: &hellip;You being an advocate of this non-patency, have
you faced any problems with this multinationals or something?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: have I faced any problems&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: &hellip;so far in your life ?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry.  What did he say?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Have you faced any problems with multi-nationals in your
life?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, there are many.  In the community where I develop
software, there are many examples of programs that had their features
taken out, programs that didn't have the features put in the first
place, programs that were not even written for many years, because of
this.  There are many examples of jobs we can't do, because we're not
allowed to do them.
<p>
Now we collected examples of this and were looking for people to write
them up.  You've to look at each example and investigate it fully and
write down a clear description of what happened and what the harm was
and so on.  We had had trouble finding people to do this.  We're
looking for more.  So someone who is really good at writing clear
English might want to volunteer for this.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: I think he asked whether you had any threat to you by
any multinational companies&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well they never threatened my life!</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yeah that's the question!</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: But they do threaten our work.  Now they threaten to sue
us.</dd>

<dt><b>Volunteer</b>: There's a question from a gentleman at the back:
If the multinational companies that produce hardware, like Intel,
coming to a contract coming to a contract with big software companies
to restrict Free Software by changing the microprocessor patents, how
will you overcome such a hazard?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I see very little danger of that.  Intel recently
developed a new computer architecture, and far from trying to stop us
from supporting it, they hired people to implement it.
<p>
So it looks like we should now we move to Free Software questions.
I'd like to remind people that until this last answer, I was not
speaking for the Free Software movement.  I was speaking of something
of vital interest to every programmer which is to be free to write
programs and not get sued for having written them as long as you wrote
them yourself.  And that's the freedom that you've taken for granted
until now and that's the freedom you will lose if you have software
patents.</p>
<p>
Now however we're moving to the topic of Free Software, which is what
I spent most of my time working on, and the individual, actual
software development project that I've lead which is developing the
GNU operating system, which is a Free Software, Unix-like operating
system used by some twenty million people estimated today.  So I am
going to answer questions on Free Software and GNU.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: In the absence of a concrete revenue model for Free
Software, will this also go bust like the dotcoms?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I can't predict the future but I want to remind you that
the dotcoms were businesses.  And Free Software is not primarily a
business.  There are some Free Software businesses.  Whether they will
succeed or ultimately fail, I don't know.  But those businesses do
contribute to our community, but they are not what our community is
all about.  What our community is all about is having the freedom to
redistribute and study and change software.  A lot of Free Software is
developed by volunteers and the amount is increasing and, no matter
what happens with the companies that's not going away.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: I understand companies like IBM are also investing
considerably in making their systems and software compatible with free
source code like Linux&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: You mean GNU?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: All right&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yes, they call it Linux.  Actually the system is mainly
GNU and Linux is one of the pieces.</dd>

<dt><b>[From audience]</b> The kernel is hardly eighteen percent.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, really, that much?  What I saw is three percent.</dd>

<dt><b>[From audience]</b> You can see through a needle.  Very
insignificant.</dt>

<dt><b>Q</b>: But, I also understand that they've invested around a
billion dollars in doing so.  Now my question is&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well that's not true.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: My question is, for a service that has no revenue model,
will this be sustainable in the future and if I change my business
onto&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry I can't predict the future.  No one can.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: How can I&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Some god men can predict the future.  I'm not.  I'm a
rationalist.
<p>
I can't tell you what's going to happen.  What I can tell you is that
what IBM claims to have put a billion dollars into the GNU plus Linux
operating system, that's no entirely true.  You've to look carefully
on what they're spending this money on, and you'll find they are
spending this money on various different things, some contribute and
some don't.</p>
<p>
For instance, they are funding some work on developing the GNU/Linux
system.  That's good, that contributes.  They do develop some other
Free Software packages that they've contributed to the
community.  That's a real contribution.</p>
<p>
They are also developing many non-free programs to make them run with
the GNU/Linux system and that is not a contribution.  And they are
publicizing the system, well, it's not a primary contribution, but it
does help.  You know, having more user is not our primary goal.  But
it's nice if more people would try our software, so that does help,
but then they're mistakenly calling this Linux which is not quite
right, and they're lobbying for software patents in Europe, which is
bad, so, yeah IBM is doing many different things, some are good and
some are bad, and if you want to have a full view, it's important to
look at the individual actions.  Do not try to add it up because that
just means you're missing the important aspects of the situation.</p>
<p>
Are there any more questions?</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: This question is not about patent or copyright or
anything like that.  But this is one example what you said about
&mdash; if statement and while statement &mdash; that you said
something about the differences in the field of computer science and
differences other sciences, that is other engineering sciences.  You
said that if I change something in the if loop that's if statement,
there won't be any effect, that you said&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No I didn't say that.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: You said that!  You said that there isn't any heating
effect.  I remember that&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry, I know what I said.  I said something that's
partly similar to that&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: I'll tell the exact statement: you said there won't any
heating effect.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Any whating effect?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Heating effect.  Heating&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Oh yes we don't have to worry about how much heat
is&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Then what is it that cascading
effect?  If I change the structure of the loop, there will be an
effect.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Oh sure.  The program will behave differently when you
change it, but I'm not saying that writing every program is easy that
we never make mistakes.  I listed a lot of specific kinds of problems,
that would plague a mechanical or electrical engineer at every little
detail, even if each detail gets to be very hard for them.  Worse for
us, the problems are because we do so much, we're doing it so fast, we
don't think carefully about each one thing.  So we make mistakes.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: So you admit that there's an effect.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Of course.  I never said otherwise, I'm sorry if you
thought so.  Sure if you change a program it's going to do different
things.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, can you comment on the commercial
distributions?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, you asked me to comment on the commercial
distributions of GNU/Linux systems?  Well, I think that's fine.
That's one of the freedoms Free Software gives you &mdash; the freedom
to use it in business, the freedom to distribute it as part of the
business, the freedom to sell copies in exchange for money.  These are
all legitimate.
<p>
Now, one thing I'm unhappy about is what the companies do this is that
they add some non-free software to it.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: That's the installation program?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Yeah, any non-free software.  Because the goal was you
should be able to get a completely free operating system.  Well, if I
have a thing in a store which says I'm the GNU/Linux system, the
public says Linux, but inside it there are some non-free programs, now
you're not getting something that's entirely free anymore.  It doesn't
entirely respect your freedom.  So the real goal for which we wrote
the system is being lost.
<p>
So that's a major problem our community faces now.  The tendency to
put free software together with non-free software and make these
non-free overall systems.  And then, you know, it might seem that the
software is a success because many people are using it.  But if you
look at our real goal, our real goal is not popularity.  Our real goal
is to spread a community of freedom and we're not succeeding in doing
that if the people are using non-free software systems.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I couldn't give both speeches.  I can give a speech
about software patents, or I can give a speech about free software.
They're very different and each one of them is a long speech.  So
unfortunately what it means is that I can't explain about Free
Software and the GNU project here.  Am I giving anther speech in
Kochi?  Am I giving the Free Software speech in Kochi?</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: No.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Oh well.  I gave that speech in Trivandrum.
<p>
So I'll answer five more questions and then I have to call it quits
because it gets to be quite draining to answer so many.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Excuse me sir, question from me again.  Sir, this is a
personal question.  Me, as such, I love programming. I spend a lot of
time in front of my system.  And I was listening to some of your
earlier speeches where you said that back in the 70's, the community
of programmers had a sense of goodwill among them.  They used to share
code, they used to develop on it.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, a specific community of programmers which I
belonged to.  This was not all programmers.  This was one specific
community.  Continue.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yes sir.  In that context, I feel particularly, me as
such, I feel very hurt when I see the so called interaction among
programmers today.  Because many of us are very good programmers but
we look at each other in different colors depending upon the tools we
use &mdash; &ldquo;hey, he's a windows guy&rdquo;, &ldquo;hey, he's a
GNU/Linux guy&rdquo;, &ldquo;hey, he's into Solaris systems&rdquo;,
&ldquo;he's a network programmer&rdquo;.  And unfortunately most of
this prejudice come from a lot of misinterpretation out of things like
this.  None of these guys promote Free Software as such, and it hurts
me as a programmer and many of my colleagues, and I work in an
environment&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Could you speak a bit more slowly, I am hearing most of
it, but there was one point that I miss, so you speak slowly.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yeah, and that here that we work with in an environment
you are judged according to the tools you use rather than the quality
of work.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: To me that, well, in one sense there is a situation
where in a limited way that is rational.  If there is a tool which is
normally used for doing fairly easy jobs and there are lot of people
who now had to do it than I would imagine now, I wouldn't want, I
might not pay as much to them as somebody who does very hard jobs with
a different tool that's used for hard jobs.  But it's true if you're
talking about hard jobs, it makes no sense that you prejudice about
what tools people are using.  Good programmers can use any tools.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: That was not the focus here.  The focus was that here
it's a question of goodwill.  Goodwill amongst programmers these days
seems to be melted down into the, you know little boxes of this system
and that system and that hurts.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I agree we should encourage people to study more
different things and we should never be prejudiced against people
because of some detail, you know the fact that this person likes
Prolog and this person likes C, why should they hate each
other&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: It's not even that distinct.  It's like this person
works on GNU/Linux and this person works on Windows, which are the
major operating systems today in India at least.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, in that case, though it's not just a prejudice.
You see Windows is a system, a social system, that keeps people
helpless and devoid.  Whereas, GNU/Linux is an alternative that is
created specifically to liberate people and to encourage them to
collaborate.  So to sum it then, it's not like where you born in this
country or that country, no this is like your choice of politics.  And
it does make to criticize people for their choices about important
issues.
<p>
So, I would say, a person who's using Windows, well, either he's
actively supporting this power structure or at least may be he's
trapped in it and doesn't have the courage to get out.  In that case
you can forgive him, I guess, and encourage him.  You know there are
different situations in any place where people're different.  Some
people are making more or less effort to try to improve things.  I
believe in judging people as individuals, not as lumping them together
by their groups.</p>
<p>
But this is, in this one case it is, somewhat alike political choice
with political consequences for society and that's exactly what makes
sense to criticize people.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sorry to continue again on this, but I'm a little
persistent about this. It's&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: This is your last chance.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yes sir, thank you.  Generally when statements like
these are made people who are not so much, you know, in connection
with these things tend to assume that cooperative communities and
sharing of source code and sharing of ideas and things like that don't
exist in other environments but they do, and that's very unfortunate
that they think so.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry &hellip; &ldquo;that don't exist in other
environments&rdquo;, I don't know which other environments that you're
talking about I don't understand.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Other programming environments, other operating
systems.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well may be there are some users developing some Free
Software that runs on Windows, in fact I'm sure&hellip;

<p><i>Note: At this point, there was a short blackout, and both the
recording and the transcript is incomplete here.</i></p></dd>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, may be there, are there any questions?  Could you
speak louder?  I can't hear you at all.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir may I ask you a question?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Okay you can, sure.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: In Free Software System we will be distributing the
source code also together with the software.  So a person is entitled
to change whatever he can in the source code.  So don't you think
there will be too many software versions of a particular software and
this will in turn cause problems for a layman to find out which will
suit him the most.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Practical experience is that this is not a problem and
occasionally it happens.  But not very often.  Now, you see that the
reason is that the users want interoperability and with Free Software
the users are ultimately in control and what they want they tend to
get.  The Free Software developers realize that they had better
&mdash; if they are going to make incompatible changes they are likely
to make users unhappy and their versions are not going to be used.  So
they generally draw the obvious conclusion and pay a lot of attention
to interoperability.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: What I feel is that like I'll be just loading a software
into my computer and the next morning I'll find a better version then
again I'll have to change it.  The next morning again something has
been done to the source code and that's a better version, so don't
you&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: In general you are not going be finding a better version
everyday and the reason is that typically for any given program there
is usually only one version that is widely used.  May be there will be
two, once in a while there will be three &mdash; when there is no good
maintainer that might happen.  So you are just not going to keep
finding out about more versions that are good everyday; there aren't
so many.  There won't be that many popular versions.  There is one
situation where you can get a new version everyday.  That is, when
there is one team doing a lot of work on development then every day
you can get the latest version.  That you can do.  But there is only
one version at any given time.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Sir, don't you think we will have to implement an
organization which will take into consideration all these updations
and it will just provide a single software which will have all the
updations right.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.  Shouldn't we have an
organization that would do something with all these versions &hellip;
but i don't know what.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Like, say I have developed a version of&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Did anyone else hear what she said?  Could anyone else
tell me what she said?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: The thing is that&hellip;</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: It's a very valuable skill to learn to speak slowly and
clearly.  If you ever want to give a speech which as part of your
career you will, it's very helpful to learn to enunciate clearly and
slowly.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Thank you sir.  Sir the thing is that don't you feel
that we require an organization which will just perform a number of
updations together and make available a software which will club all
the updations until that date?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: You are saying, take various different applications and
put them together?</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Yes Sir.</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I will tell you a lot of organizations are doing that;
in fact every one of the GNU/Linux distributions is exactly that.
Debian does that, Red Hat does that&hellip; We to some extent do that
also for the GNU packages.  We work on making sure they work
together.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Excuse me Sir, we have talked lot against patents.  In
US conditions have you ever been forced to put forward any
applications for patents?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: No.  But no one can force me to make a patent
application&hellip;</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Also do you own any patents?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: I do not own any patents.  Now, I have considered the
possibility of applying for patents to use them as part of a mutual
strategic defense alliance.</dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Do you mean to say that if I have twenty patents with
me, I donate it to the FSF and you maintain it for me?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Well, not the FSF, it would be a separate specialized
organization that would exist specifically so that we would all
contribute are patents and that organizations would use all of these
patents to shelter anyone who wishes shelter.  So anyone can join the
organization, even somebody who has no patents.  And that person gets
shelter of this organization.  But then we all do try to get patents
so as to make the organization stronger so it can protect us all
better.  That is the idea, but so far no one has been able to get this
started.  It's not an easy thing to do, and part of the reason is that
applying for the patent is very expensive.  And a lot of work as
well.
<p>
So this will be the last question.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Q</b>: Why can't the Free Software foundation start its own
distribution?</dt>

<dd><b>A</b>: Oh well, the reason is that Debian is almost what we
want, and it seems better to be friends with Debian and try to
convince them to change it a little rather than to say, &ldquo;Well,
we are not going to use it; we are going to make our own thing&rdquo;.
And also it seems likely to be more successful too because, after all
there are a lot of people working on Debian already.  Why try to make
an alternative to that large community.  Much better to work with them
and convince them to support our goals better.  If it works, of
course, and we have our ways to go in that.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So that was the last question, I can't stay all day answering
questions, I'm sorry.  So at this point I am going to have to call a
halt and get going and go have lunch.  So thank you for listening.</p>

<p>[Applause].</p>
