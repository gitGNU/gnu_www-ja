"The four essential freedoms provide the criteria for <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">whether a particular piece of code is "
"free/libre</a> (i.e., respects its users' freedom).  How should we apply "
"them to judge whether a software package, an operating system, a computer, "
"or a web page is fit to recommend?"

"Whether a program is free affects first of all our decisions about our "
"private activities: to maintain our freedom, we need to reject the programs "
"that would take it away.  However, it also affects what we should say to "
"others and do with others."

"A nonfree program is an injustice.  To distribute a nonfree program, to "
"recommend a nonfree program to other people, or more generally steer them "
"into a course that leads to using nonfree software, means leading them to "
"give up their freedom.  To be sure, leading people to use nonfree software "
"is not the same as installing nonfree software in their computers, but we "
"should not lead people in the wrong direction."

"At a deeper level, we must not present a nonfree program as a solution "

"For a software package to be free, all the code in it must be free.  But not "

"We developed GNU so that there would be a free operating system, because in "
"1983 none existed.  As we developed the initial components of GNU, in the "
"1980s, it was inevitable that each component depended on nonfree software.  "
"For instance, no C program could run without a nonfree C compiler until GCC "
"was working, and none could run without Unix libc until glibc was working.  "
"Each component could run only on nonfree systems, because all systems were "
"nonfree."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"After we released a component that could run on some nonfree systems, users "
"ported it to other nonfree systems; those ports were no worse, ethically, "

"When the kernel, Linux, was freed in 1992, it filled the last gap in the GNU "
"system.  (Initially, in 1991, Linux had been distributed under a nonfree "
"license.)  The combination of GNU and Linux made a complete free operating "
"system&mdash;<a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux</a>."

"At that point, we could have deleted the support for nonfree platforms, but "
"we decided not to.  A nonfree system is an injustice, but it's not our fault "
"a user runs one.  Supporting a free program on that system does not compound "
"the injustice.  And it's useful, not only for users of those systems, but "
"also for attracting more people to contribute to developing the free "
"program."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"However, a nonfree program that runs on top of a free program is a "
"completely different issue, because it leads users to take a step away from "
"freedom.  In some cases we disallow this: for instance, <a "
"href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-01/msg00247.html\">GCC prohibits "
"nonfree plug-ins</a>.  When a program permits nonfree add-ons, it should at "
"least not steer people towards using them.  For instance, we choose "
"LibreOffice over OpenOffice because OpenOffice suggests use of nonfree "
"add-ons, while LibreOffice shuns them.  We developed <a "
"href=\"http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/IceCat\">IceCat</a> initially to avoid "
"proposing the nonfree add-ons suggested by Firefox."

"In practice, if the IceCat package explains how to run IceCat on MacOS, that "
"will not lead people to run MacOS.  But if it talked about some nonfree "

"the IceCat package, including manuals and web site, shouldn't talk about "
"such things."

"Sometimes a free program and a nonfree program interoperate but neither is "
"based on the other.  Our rule for such cases is that if the nonfree program "
"is very well known, we should tell people how to use our free program with "
"it; but if the proprietary program is obscure, we should not hint that it "
"exists.  Sometimes we support interoperation with the nonfree program if "
"that is installed, but avoid telling users about the possibility of doing "
"so."

"The rules for a software package apply to a distro too: an ethical distro "
"must contain only free software and steer users only towards free software.  "
"But what does it mean for a distro to &ldquo;contain&rdquo; a particular "
"software package?"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Some distros install programs from binary packages that are part of the "
"distro; others build each program from upstream source, and literally "
"<em>contain</em> only the recipes to download and build it.  For issues of "
"freedom, how a distro installs a given package is not significant; if it "
"presents that package as an option, or its web site does, we say it "
"&ldquo;contains&rdquo; that package."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"The users of a free system have control over it, so they can install "
"whatever they wish.  Free distros provide general facilities with which "
"users can install their own programs and their modified versions of free "
"programs; they can also install nonfree programs.  Providing these general "
"facilities is not an ethical flaw in the distro, because the distro's "
"developers are not responsible for what users get and install on their own "
"initiative."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The developers become responsible for installation of nonfree software when "
"they steer the users toward a nonfree program&mdash;for instance, by putting "
"it in the distro's list of packages, or distributing it from their server, "
"or presenting it as a solution rather than a problem.  This is the point "
"where most GNU/Linux distros have an ethical flaw."

"People who install software packages on their own have a certain level of "
"sophistication: if we tell them &ldquo;Baby contains nonfree code, but Gbaby "
"is free,&rdquo; we can expect them to take care to remember which is which.  "
"But distros are recommended to ordinary users who would forget such "
"details.  They would think, &ldquo;What name did they say I should use? I "
"think it was Baby.&rdquo;"

"Therefore, to recommend a distro to the general public, we insist that its "
"name not be similar to a distro we reject, so our message recommending only "
"the free distro can be reliably transmitted."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Another difference between a distro and a software package is how likely it "
"is for nonfree code to be added.  The developers of a program carefully "
"check the code they add.  If they have decided to make the program free, "
"they are unlikely to add nonfree code.  There have been exceptions, "
"including the very harmful case of the &ldquo;binary blobs&rdquo; that were "
"added to Linux, but they are a small fraction of the free programs that "
"exist."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"By contrast, a GNU/Linux distro typically contains thousands of packages, "
"and the distro's developers may add hundreds of packages a year.  Without a "
"careful effort to avoid packages that contain some nonfree software, some "
"will surely creep in.  Since the free distros are few in number, we ask the "
"developers of each free distro to make a commitment to keep the distro free "
"software by removing any nonfree code or malware, as a condition for listing "
"that distro.  See the <a "
"href=\"/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html\">GNU free system "
"distribution guidelines</a>."

"We don't ask for such promises for free software packages: it's not "
"feasible, and fortunately not necessary.  To get promises from the "
"developers of 30,000 free programs to keep them free would avoid a few "
"problems, at the cost of much work for the FSF staff; in addition, most of "
"those developers have no relationship with the GNU Project and might have no "
"interest in making us any promises.  So we deal with the rare cases that "
"change from free to nonfree, when we find out about them."
