"Many of us know that governments can threaten the human rights of software "
"users through censorship and surveillance of the Internet.  Many do not "
"realize that the software they run on their home or work computers can be an "
"even worse threat.  Thinking of software as &lsquo;just a tool&rsquo;, they "
"suppose that it obeys them, when in fact it often obeys others instead."

"The software running in most computers is <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware\">non-free, "
"proprietary software</a>: controlled by software companies, not by its "
"users.  Users can't check what these programs do, nor prevent them from "
"doing what they don't want.  Most people accept this because they have seen "
"no other way, but it is simply wrong to give developers power over the "
"users' computer."

"This unjust power, as usual, tempts its wielders to further misdeeds. If a "
"computer talks to a network, and you don't control the software in it, it "
"can easily spy on you.  Microsoft Windows spies on users; for instance, it "
"reports what words a user searches for in her own files, and what other "
"programs are installed.  RealPlayer spies too; it reports what the user "
"plays.  Cell phones are full of non-free software, which spies.  Cell phones "
"send out localizing signals even when &lsquo;off&rsquo;, many can send out "
"your precise GPS location whether you wish or not, and some models can be "
"switched on remotely as listening devices.  Users can't fix these malicious "
"features because they don't have control."

"Some proprietary software is designed to restrict and attack its users.  <a "
"href=\"http://badvista.org/\">Windows Vista</a> is a big advance in this "
"field; the reason it requires replacement of old hardware is that the new "
"models are designed to support unbreakable restrictions.  Microsoft thus "
"requires users to pay for shiny new shackles.  It is also designed to permit "
"forced updating by corporate authority.  Hence the <a "
"href=\"http://badvista.org/\">BadVista.org</a> campaign, which urges Windows "
"users not to &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; to Vista.  (For the equally malicious "
"Windows 7, we now have <a "
"href=\"http://windows7sins.org/\">Windows7Sins.org</a>.)  Mac OS also "
"contains features designed to restrict its users."

"Microsoft has installed back doors for the US government's use in the past "
"(<a href=\"http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/5/5263/1.html\">reported on "
"heise.de</a>).  We cannot check whether they have successors today.  Other "
"proprietary programs may or may not have back doors, but since we cannot "
"check them, we cannot trust them."

"The only way to assure that your software is working for you is to insist on "
"Free/Libre software.  This means users get the source code, are free to "
"study and change it, and are free to redistribute it with or without "
"changes.  The <a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux system</a>, "
"developed <a href=\"/gnu/\">specifically for users' freedom</a>, includes "
"office applications, multimedia, games, and everything you really need to "
"run a computer.  See <a href=\"http://www.gnewsense.org/\">gNewSense.org</a> "

"A special problem occurs when activists for social change use proprietary "
"software, because its developers, who control it, may be companies they wish "
"to protest&mdash;or that work hand in glove with the states whose policies "
"they oppose.  Control of our software by a proprietary software company, "
"whether it be Microsoft, Apple, Adobe or Skype, means control of what we can "
"say, and to whom.  This threatens our freedom in all areas of life."

"There is also danger in using a company's server to do your word processing "
"or email&mdash;and not just if you are in China, as US lawyer Michael "
"Springmann discovered.  In 2003, AOL not only handed over to the police his "
"confidential discussions with clients, it also made his email and his "
"address list disappear, and didn't admit this was intentional until one of "
"its staff made a slip.  Springmann gave up on getting his data back."
