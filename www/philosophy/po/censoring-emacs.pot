"Last summer, a few clever legislators proposed a bill to &ldquo;prohibit "
"pornography&rdquo; on the Internet. Last fall, the right-wing Christians "
"made this cause their own. Last week, President Clinton signed the "
"bill. This week, I'm censoring GNU Emacs."

"No, GNU Emacs does not contain pornography. It's a software package, an "
"award-winning extensible and programmable text editor. But the law that was "
"passed applies to far more than pornography. It prohibits "
"&ldquo;indecent&rdquo; speech, which can include anything from famous poems, "
"to masterpieces hanging in the Louvre, to advice about safe sex &hellip; to "
"software."

"Naturally, there was a lot of opposition to this bill. Not only from people "
"who use the Internet and people who appreciate erotica, but from everyone "
"who cares about freedom of the press."

"But every time we tried to tell the public what was at stake, the forces of "
"censorship responded with a lie: They told the public that the issue was "
"simply pornography. By embedding this lie as a presupposition in their other "
"statements about the issue, they succeeded in misinforming the public. So "
"now I am censoring my software."

"You see, Emacs contains a version of the famous &ldquo;doctor "
"program,&rdquo; a.k.a. Eliza, originally developed by Professor Weizenbaum "
"at <abbr title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">MIT</abbr>.  This "
"is the program that imitates a Rogerian psychotherapist. The user talks to "
"the program, and the program responds&mdash;by playing back the user's own "
"statements, and by recognizing a long list of particular words."

"The Emacs doctor program was set up to recognize many common curse words and "
"respond with an appropriately cute message such as, &ldquo;Would you please "
"watch your tongue?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let's not be vulgar.&rdquo; In order to "
"do this, it had to have a list of curse words. That means the source code "
"for the program was indecent."

"So this week I removed that feature. The new version of the doctor doesn't "
"recognize the indecent words; if you curse at it, it replays the curse back "
"to you&mdash;for lack of knowing better. (When the new version starts up, it "
"announces that it has been censored for your protection.)"

"Now that Americans face the threat of two years in prison for indecent "
"network postings, it would be helpful if they could access precise rules for "
"avoiding imprisonment via the Internet. However, this is impossible. The "
"rules would have to mention the forbidden words, so posting them on the "
"Internet would violate those same rules."

"Of course, I'm making an assumption about just what &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; "
"means.  I have to do this, because nobody knows for sure. The most obvious "
"possible meaning is the meaning it has for television, so I'm using that as "
"a tentative assumption. However, there is a good chance that our courts will "
"reject that interpretation of the law as unconstitutional."

"We can hope that the courts will recognize the Internet as a medium of "
"publication like books and magazines. If they do, they will entirely reject "

"What really worries me is that the courts might choose a muddled "
"half-measure&mdash;by approving an interpretation of &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; "
"that permits the doctor program or a statement of the decency rules, but "
"prohibits some of the books that any child can browse through in the public "
"library. Over the years, as the Internet replaces the public library, some "
"of our freedom of speech will be lost."

"Just a few weeks ago, another country imposed censorship on the "
"Internet. That was China. We don't think well of China in this "
"country&mdash;its government doesn't respect basic freedoms. But how well "
"does our government respect them? And do you care enough to preserve them "
"here?"
