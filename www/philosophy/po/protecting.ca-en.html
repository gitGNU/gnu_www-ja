<h2>Help Protect the Rights to Write Both Non-Free and Free Software</h2>

<p>
The right to write both non-free and free software is threatened by
<a href="http://progfree.org/Patents/patents.html">software patents</a>
and by
<a href="http://progfree.org/Copyright/copyright.html">&ldquo;look-and-feel&rdquo;
interface copyright lawsuits</a>.</p>

<p>
  The Free Software Foundation fights these threats in many ways.
  These include support for and being a member of
  <a href="http://progfree.org/">League for Programming Freedom</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The League is a grass-roots organization of professors, students,
  business people, programmers, users, and even software companies
  dedicated to bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League
  isn't opposed to the legal system that Congress
  intended&mdash;copyright on individual programs.  The League aims to
  reverse recent changes made by judges in response to special
  interests.
</p>

<p>The FSF urges you to join us in fighting these threats by <a
href="http://progfree.org/Help/help.html">helping the League</a>.</p>

<p>
  <strong>The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation,
      and is not concerned with the issue of free software.</strong> The
  FSF supports the League because, like any software developer smaller
  than Microsoft, it is endangered by software patents, and interface
  copyrights.  You are in danger, too!  It would be easy to ignore the
  problem until you or your employer is sued, but it is more prudent to
  organize before that happens.
