"The reproduction and distribution cost of software is zero at the "
"margin. This means that in theory it is no more expensive to produce "
"software which can be freely distributed and used by everybody than it is to "
"produce software for a limited clientele."

"The pricing of software bears no relationship to the cost of its "
"development. The two factors that do matter are market size (which is "
"limited by price and utility) and competition. Given a market for a software "
"product, the maximum margin can be obtained by precluding or eliminating "
"competition."

"Software companies that are able to thwart competition attain pinnacles of "
"power which are inconceivable in other industries.  Partly this is due to "
"the enormous cash flows that are possible in the absence of competition from "
"products with nil reproduction costs, but largely it is due to the "
"complexity of software itself, which allows dominant companies to design "
"&ldquo;standards&rdquo; which exclude future competition."

"All niche markets for software rapidly evolve toward monopoly or an "
"equilibrium where a small number of players tacitly agree not to mutually "
"destroy their profits. (Established companies can defend their market share "
"by reducing their prices to practically nothing, making price competition "
"suicidal for newcomers.) However, there are cases of asymetrical "
"competition, where a large company with other sources of income can destroy "
"a smaller company that depends on a single niche revenue stream."

"Microsoft has a secure revenue stream based on its dominant position in "
"personal computer operating systems software, and uses the power inherent in "
"that position to favor its other business activities with its ability to "
"dictate &ldquo;standards&rdquo; and to undermine competition, especially "
"where power (as opposed to mere money) is at stake."

"Capitalists invest in new software ventures with the hope of gaining a "
"dominant position in a new niche market. There is essentially no new "
"investment in existing niche markets, since it is impossible to compete with "
"an established dominant player on the basis of lower costs and the possible "
"gains of an uphill battle for a small share of a shrinking pie rarely "
"justify the risks. In their wildest dreams these capitalists want nothing so "
"much as to be just like Microsoft."

"The drive to restrain Microsoft under the rubric of antitrust law seems "
"mostly to be the effort of companies who find their own power positions "
"threatened by Microsoft's activities. They seek to make it harder for "
"Microsoft to undermine their own businesses. However, they are fundamentally "
"similar to Microsoft in that they don't question a world where technology "
"companies working from private caches of intellectual property are able to "
"control the use of that technology for their own best profit."

"In the market equation, demand is equal to, and in many ways the master of, "
"production. Yet in the world we live in, production is highly organized and "
"efficient and commands enormous financial resources and seductive powers of "
"persuasion, while demand is fragmented, uninformed, and powerless. While "
"consumers can still kill a product that they have no desire for, they are "
"nearly powerless to direct or even influence the detailed designs of those "
"products.  For software products, consumers can only choose among a given "
"set of alternatives, which are extremely complex, dauntingly impenetrable, "
"and generally designed more for the company's anticompetitive purposes than "
"for the user's tasks. (Even the old fashioned option of doing without is "
"often impossible due to the intricate web of interdependencies as new "
"hardware and software march in lock step into the future.)"

"The real &ldquo;killer software&rdquo; is free software: software that is "
"free of intellectual property claims; that is published in source code form, "
"so can be inspected, evaluated, fixed and enhanced by anyone with a mind to "
"do so; that is freely distributed and can be installed on machines and used "
"without limit. Free software is the software that kills the closed, "
"nefarious software product industry. It is software that users can select "
"intelligently, to do today's tasks, and which they can collaboratively build "
"on to handle future needs. Free software is the one thing that not even "
"Microsoft can compete with."

"Still, there is one core problem: who pays for developing free software? The "
"usual answer &mdash; which leads to all of the trouble above &mdash; is that "
"investors pay for development, which they recover from their profits. The "
"only real answer is that development costs must be paid for by users. The "
"key point here is that what is paid for is not the distribution or use of "
"the software, but its development, and that the development of free software "
"implies that it can be used by anyone. I think there is a simple way to "
"handle this: anyone who wants a piece of software developed or enhanced "
"posts a &ldquo;request-for-proposal,&rdquo; including a sum that the "
"requester is willing to contribute towards its development. Intermediary "
"organizations can pool these requests, and interested parties can up the "
"ante. Developers can then search through the current postings and bid on "
"development work or work on spec. Developers can also post their own "
"proposals, which users can then buy into."

"Free software can be developed less expensively than closed software "
"products. Even for well paid professional developers, fully underwritten by "
"conscientious users, the cost of free software would be significantly less "
"than the premiums now being paid for empire building. The quality would be "
"better, especially in terms of fitness for use. Free distribution would "
"ensure maximum exposure and choice: a free market based purely on utility "
"and quality. The service component of software would also open up: anyone "
"who wanted to could start from the same code, to learn, support, and "
"teach. The best service providers would succeed."

"Simple steps can get this movement underway: Form an initial organization to "
"sort out the technical issues, suggest working arrangements, study the "
"economics, hack out a legal framework, seed and coordinate the requests, and "
"canvas for initial technology contributions (including the large body of "
"currently available freeware), do some evangelical work. Urge large "
"companies and organizations to budget a small fraction of their annual "
"software outlays for proposals. Set up a review group for intellectual "
"property issues, challenge dubious claims, and investigate the feasibility "
"of buying and releasing rights to valid claims.  Encourage the development "
"of more local organizations &mdash; local to place, to industry, to niche, "
"to taste &mdash; with the initial group breaking up or fading away: common "
"methods and procedures, but no centralized control."
