"The brave new world of e-books: no more used book stores, no more lending a "
"book to your friend, no more borrowing one from the public library, no "
"purchasing a book except with a credit card that identifies what you read.  "
"Even reading an e-book without authorization is a crime."

"Once upon a time, in the age of the printing press, an industrial regulation "
"was established for the business of writing and publishing. It was called "
"copyright. Copyright's purpose was to encourage the publication of a "
"diversity of written works. Copyright's method was to make publishers get "
"permission from authors to reprint recent writings."

"Ordinary readers had little reason to disapprove, since copyright restricted "
"only publication, not the things a reader could do. If it raised the price "
"of a book a small amount, that was only money. Copyright provided a public "
"benefit, as intended, with little burden on the public. It did its job "
"well&mdash;back then."

"Then a new way of distributing information came about: computers and "
"networks. The advantage of digital information technology is that it "
"facilitates copying and manipulating information, including software, "
"musical recordings and books. Networks offered the possibility of unlimited "
"access to all sorts of data&mdash;an information utopia."

"But one obstacle stood in the way: copyright. Readers who made use of their "
"computers to share published information were technically copyright "
"infringers. The world had changed, and what was once an industrial "
"regulation on publishers had become a restriction on the public it was meant "
"to serve."

"In a democracy, a law that prohibits a popular, natural and useful activity "
"is usually soon relaxed. But the powerful publishers' lobby was determined "
"to prevent the public from taking advantage of the power of their computers, "
"and found copyright a suitable weapon. Under their influence, rather than "
"relaxing copyright to suit the new circumstances, governments made it "
"stricter than ever, imposing harsh penalties on readers caught sharing."

"But that wasn't the last of it. Computers can be powerful tools of "
"domination when a few people control what other people's computers do. The "
"publishers realized that by forcing people to use specially designated "
"software to watch videos and read e-books, they can gain unprecedented "
"power: they can compel readers to pay, and identify themselves, every time "
"they read a book!"

"That is the publishers' dream, and they prevailed upon the U.S. government "
"to enact the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. This law gives them "
"total legal power over almost anything a reader might do with an e-book, as "
"long as they publish the book in encrypted form. Even reading the book "
"without authorization is a crime."

"We still have the same old freedoms in using paper books. But if e-books "
"replace printed books, that exception will do little good. With "
"&ldquo;electronic ink&rdquo;, which makes it possible to download new text "
"onto an apparently printed piece of paper, even newspapers could become "
"ephemeral. Imagine: no more used book stores; no more lending a book to your "
"friend; no more borrowing one from the public library&mdash;no more "
"&ldquo;leaks&rdquo; that might give someone a chance to read without "
"paying. (And judging from the ads for Microsoft Reader, no more anonymous "
"purchasing of books either.) This is the world publishers have in mind for "
"us."

"Why is there so little public debate about these momentous changes? Most "
"citizens have not yet had occasion to come to grips with the political "
"issues raised by this futuristic technology. Besides, the public has been "
"taught that copyright exists to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the copyright holders, "
"with the implication that the public's interests do not count. (The biased "
"term &ldquo;<a href=\"/philosophy/not-ipr.html\"> intellectual "
"property</a>&rdquo; also promotes that view; in addition, it encourages the "
"mistake of trying to treat several laws that are almost totally "
"different&mdash;such as copyright law and patent law&mdash;as if they were a "
"single issue.)"

"But when the public at large begins to use e-books, and discovers the regime "

"The publishers would have us believe that suppressive copyright is the only "
"way to keep art alive, but we do not need a War on Copying to encourage a "
"diversity of published works; as the Grateful Dead showed, private copying "
"among fans is not necessarily a problem for artists. (In 2007, Radiohead "
"made millions by inviting fans to copy an album and pay whatever amount they "
"wish; a few years before, Stephen King got hundreds of thousands for an "
"e-book which people could copy.) By legalizing the copying of e-books among "
"friends, we can turn copyright back into the industrial regulation it once "
"was."

"For some kinds of writing, we should go even further. For scholarly papers "
"and monographs, everyone should be encouraged to republish them verbatim "
"online; this helps protect the scholarly record while making it more "
"accessible. For textbooks and most reference works, publication of modified "
"versions should be allowed as well, since that encourages improvement."

"Eventually, when computer networks provide an easy way to send someone a "
"small amount of money, the whole rationale for restricting verbatim copying "
"will go away. If you like a book, and a box pops up on your computer saying "
"&ldquo;Click here to give the author one dollar&rdquo;, wouldn't you click? "
"Copyright for books and music, as it applies to distributing verbatim "
"unmodified copies, will be entirely obsolete. And not a moment too soon!"
