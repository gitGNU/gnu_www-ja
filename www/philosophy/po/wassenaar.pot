"Our first information about the new Wassenaar Arrangement came in the form "
"of a newspaper article, which said that export of encryption software would "
"be prohibited&mdash;and this seemed to include free software.  So we posted "
"an announcement seeking people in non-Wassenaar countries to participate in "
"distribution and development of free software for encryption."

"Subsequently the actual text of the new version of Wassenaar Arrangement was "
"published.  Then we saw that it continues to have an exception that seems to "
"cover free software.  (They use the term &ldquo;public domain&rdquo;, but "
"they seem to mean something like free software by that.)  So the problem "
"seems to have been a false alarm."

"However, the US continues to seek such restrictions, and therefore it makes "
"sense to continue our preparations, as a precaution in case a future version "
"of the Wassenaar Arrangement places further restrictions on exportation of "
"free software."

"According to the General Software Notes, entry 2, the agreement does not "
"cover software which is in &ldquo;the public domain&rdquo;. This is defined "
"in the definitions as technology or software which has been made available "
"without restrictions upon its further dissemination.  There is also a "
"statement that copyright by itself does not deny a program this "
"&ldquo;public domain&rdquo; status."

"There are currently discussions about the agreement and it would seem "
"logical that the definition of &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; is something that "
"will be clarified at future meetings."
