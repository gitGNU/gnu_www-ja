"The Public Domain Manifesto (<a "

"has its heart in the right place as it objects to some of the unjust "
"extensions of copyright power, so I wish I could support it.  However, it "
"falls far short of what is needed."

"Some flaws are at the level of implicit assumptions.  The manifesto "
"frequently uses <a href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html\">propaganda "
"terms</a> of the copyright industry, such as <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Protection\">&ldquo;copyright "
"protection&rdquo;</a>.  These terms were chosen to lead people to sympathize "
"with the copyright industry and its demands for power."

"The manifesto and its signatories use the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo;, which confuses the issue of copyright by lumping it "
"together with a dozen other laws that have nothing significant in common.  "
"(See <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/not-ipr.html\">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html</a> "
"for more explanation about this point.)  Ironically it uses the term first "
"in a sentence which points out that this manifesto is concerned only with "
"copyright law, not with those other laws.  That is with good reason: the "
"other laws are not relevant to copying and using published works.  If we "
"seek to teach the public to distinguish between these laws, we should avoid "
"setting an example which spuriously lumps them together."

"General Principle 2 repeats the common error that copyright should balance "
"the public interest with &ldquo;protecting and rewarding the author&rdquo;.  "
"This error interferes with proper judgment of any copyright policy question, "
"since that should be based on the public interest.  <a "

"It would be difficult to stand aside from a campaign for the right goals "
"merely because it was written with unclear words.  However, the manifesto "
"falls far short in its specific goals too.  It is not that I oppose them.  "
"Any one of its demands, individually, would be a step forward, even though "
"the wording of some of them discourages me from signing my name to them."

"Rather the problem is that it fails to ask for the most important points.  I "
"cannot say, &ldquo;This manifesto is what I stand for.&rdquo; I cannot say, "
"&ldquo;I support what's in this manifesto,&rdquo; unless I can add, equally "
"visibly, &ldquo;But it fails to mention the most important points of "

"General Principle 5 opposes contracts that restrict use of copies of public "
"domain works.  But where we most need to oppose such contracts is where they "
"apply to works that are still copyrighted (this is how Amazon tries to claim "
"that you don't own the e-book that you bought).  Likewise, General Principle "
"5 condemns <acronym title=\"Digital Restrictions Management\">DRM</acronym>, "
"but only when it applies to a public domain work.  In effect, it legitimizes "
"most real DRM by omitting it from criticism."

"I've saved the biggest omission for last.  General Recommendation 9 calls "
"for allowing &ldquo;personal copying&rdquo; of copyrighted works.  Since it "
"omits the issue of the freedom to share copies of published works with "
"others, it fails to address the nastiest aspect of copyright: the vicious <a "

"on Sharing</a> that the entertainment companies are now waging."

"The demands and recommendations of the Public Domain Manifesto would be a "
