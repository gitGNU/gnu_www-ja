"A project called UDI (Uniform Driver Interface) aims to define a single "
"interface between operating system kernels and device drivers.  What should "
"the free software movement make of this idea?"

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If we imagine a number of operating systems and hardware developers, all "
"cooperating on an equal footing, UDI (if technically feasible)  would be a "
"very good idea.  It would permit us to develop just one driver for any given "
"hardware device, and then all share it.  It would enable a higher level of "
"cooperation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"When we apply the idea to the actual world, which contains both free "
"software developers seeking cooperation, and proprietary software developers "
"seeking domination, the consequences are very different.  No way of using "
"UDI can benefit the free software movement.  If it does anything, it will "
"divide and weaken us."

"If Linux supported UDI, and if we started designing new drivers to "
"communicate with Linux through UDI, what would the consequences be?"

"This would help only Windows users; it would do nothing for us users of free "
"operating systems.  It would not directly hurt us, either; but the "
"developers of GPL-covered free drivers could be discouraged to see them used "
"in this way, and that would be very bad.  It can also be a violation of the "
"GNU GPL to link the drivers into a proprietary kernel.  To increase the "
"temptation to do so is asking for trouble."

"This would not directly affect the range of hardware supported by free "
"software.  But indirectly it would tend to decrease the range, by offering a "
"temptation to the millions of GNU/Linux users who have not learned to insist "
"on freedom for its own sake.  To the extent that the community began to "
"accept the temptation, we would be moving to using non-free drivers instead "
"of writing free ones."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>

"UDI would not in itself obstruct development of free drivers.  So if enough "
"of us rejected the temptation, we could still develop free drivers despite "
"UDI, just as we do without UDI."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"But why encourage the community to be weaker than it needs to be? Why make "
"unnecessary difficulties for the future of free software? Since UDI does no "
"good for us, it is better to reject UDI."

"Given these consequences, it is no surprise that Intel, a supporter of UDI, "
"has started to &ldquo;look to the Linux community for help with UDI.&rdquo; "
"How does a rich and self-seeking company approach a cooperating community? "
"By asking for a handout, of course.  They have nothing to lose by asking, "
"and we might be caught off guard and say yes."

"Cooperation with UDI is not out of the question.  We should not label UDI, "
"Intel, or anyone, as a Great Satan.  But before we participate in any "
"proposed deal, we must judge it carefully, to make sure it is advantageous "
"for the free software community, not just for proprietary system "
"developers.  On this particular issue, that means requiring that cooperation "
"take us a step further along a path that leads to the ultimate goal for free "
"kernels and drivers: supporting <em>all</em> important hardware with free "
"drivers."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One way to make a deal a good one could be by modifying the UDI project "
"itself.  Eric Raymond has proposed that UDI compliance could require that "
"the driver be free software.  That would be ideal, but other alternatives "
"could also work.  Just requiring source for the driver to be published, and "
"not a trade secret, could do the job&mdash;because even if that driver is "
"not free, it would at least tell us what we need to know to write a free "
"driver."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Intel could also do something outside of UDI to help the free software "
"community solve this problem.  For example, there may be some sort of "
"certification that hardware developers seek, that Intel plays a role in "
"granting.  If so, Intel could agree to make certification more difficult if "
"the hardware specs are secret.  That might not be a complete solution to the "
"problem, but it could help quite a bit."

"One difficulty with any deal with Intel about UDI is that we would do our "
"part for Intel at the beginning, but Intel's payback would extend over a "
"long time.  In effect, we would be extending credit to Intel.  But would "
"Intel continue to repay its loan? Probably yes, if we get it in writing and "
"there are no loopholes; otherwise, we can't count on it.  Corporations are "
"notoriously untrustworthy; the people we are dealing with may have "
"integrity, but they could be overruled from above, or even replaced at any "
"time with different people.  Even a CEO who owns most of the stock can be "
"replaced through a buy-out.  When making a deal with a corporation, always "
"get a binding commitment in writing."

"It does not seem likely that Intel would offer a deal that gives us what we "
"need.  In fact, UDI seems designed to make it easier to keep specifications "
"secret."

"Still, there is no harm in keeping the door unlocked, as long as we are "
"careful about who we let in."
