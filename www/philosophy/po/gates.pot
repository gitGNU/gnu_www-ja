"To pay so much attention to Bill Gates' retirement is missing the "
"point. What really matters is not Gates, nor Microsoft, but the unethical "
"system of restrictions that Microsoft&mdash;like many other software "
"companies&mdash;imposes on its customers."

"That statement may surprise you, since most people interested in computers "
"have strong feelings about Microsoft. Businessmen and their tame politicians "
"admire its success in building an empire over so many computer users.  Many "
"outside the computer field credit Microsoft for advances which it only took "
"advantage of, such as making computers cheap and fast, and convenient "
"graphical user interfaces."

"Gates' philanthropy for health care for poor countries has won some people's "
"good opinion. The LA Times reported that his foundation spends five to 10% "
"of its money annually and invests the rest, sometimes in companies it "

"countries.  (2010 update: The Gates Foundation is supporting a project with "
"agribusiness giant Cargill on a <a "

"Many computerists specially hate Gates and Microsoft. They have plenty of "
"reasons.  Microsoft persistently engages in anti-competitive behaviour, and "
"has been convicted three times. (Bush, who let Microsoft off the hook for "
"the second US conviction, was invited to Microsoft headquarters to solicit "
"funds for the 2000 election.  In the UK, Microsoft established a major "
"office in Gordon Brown's constituency.  Both lawful, both potentially "
"corrupting.)"

"Many users hate the &ldquo;Microsoft tax&rdquo;, the retail contracts that "
"make you pay for Windows on your computer even if you won't use it. (In some "
"countries you can get a refund, but the effort required is daunting.)  "
"There's also the Digital Restrictions Management: software features designed "
"to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; you from accessing your files freely.  (Increased "
"restriction of users seems to be the main advance of Vista.)"

"Then there are the gratuitous incompatibilities and obstacles to "
"interoperation with other software. (This is why the EU required Microsoft "
"to publish interface specifications.)  This year Microsoft packed standards "
"committees with its supporters to procure ISO approval of its unwieldy, "
"unimplementable and patented &ldquo;open standard&rdquo; for documents. (The "
"EU is now investigating this.)"

"Microsoft's software is distributed under licenses that keep users divided "

"If you're a programmer and you want to change the software, for yourself or "
"for someone else, you can't.  If you're a business and you want to pay a "
"programmer to make the software suit your needs better, you can't. If you "
"copy it to share with your friend, which is simple good-neighbourliness, "
"they call you a &ldquo;pirate&rdquo;.  Microsoft would have us believe that "
"helping your neighbour is the moral equivalent of attacking a ship."

"The most important thing that Microsoft has done is to promote this unjust "
"social system.  Gates is personally identified with it, due to his infamous "
"open letter which rebuked microcomputer users for sharing copies of his "
"software. It said, in effect, &ldquo;If you don't let me keep you divided "
"and helpless, I won't write the software and you won't have any.  Surrender "
"to me, or you're lost!&rdquo;"

"But Gates didn't invent proprietary software, and thousands of other "
"companies do the same thing. It's wrong&mdash;no matter who does "
"it. Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, and the rest, offer you software that gives "
"them power over you. A change in executives or companies is not "
"important. What we need to change is this system."

"That's what the free software movement is all about. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; "
"refers to freedom: we write and publish software that users are free to "
"share and modify.  We do this systematically, for freedom's sake; some of us "
"paid, many as volunteers. We already have complete free operating systems, "
"including GNU/Linux. Our aim is to deliver a complete range of useful free "
"software, so that no computer user will be tempted to cede her freedom to "
"get software."

"In 1984, when I started the free software movement, I was hardly aware of "
"Gates' letter. But I'd heard similar demands from others, and I had a "
"response: &ldquo;If your software would keep us divided and helpless, please "
"don't write it. We are better off without it. We will find other ways to use "
"our computers, and preserve our freedom.&rdquo;"

"In 1992, when the GNU operating system was completed by the kernel, Linux, "
