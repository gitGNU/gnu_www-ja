"I was in the pub last night, and a guy asked me for a light for his "
"cigarette. I suddenly realised that there was a demand here and money to be "
"made, and so I agreed to light his cigarette for 10 pence, but I didn't "
"actually give him a light, I sold him a license to burn his cigarette. My "
"fire-license restricted him from giving the light to anybody else, after "
"all, that fire was my property. He was drunk, and dismissing me as a loony, "
"but accepted my fire (and by implication the licence which governed its use)  "
"anyway. Of course in a matter of minutes I noticed a friend of his asking "
"him for a light and to my outrage he gave his cigarette to his friend and "
"pirated my fire! I was furious, I started to make my way over to that side "
"of the bar but to my added horror his friend then started to light other "
"people's cigarettes left, right, and centre! Before long that whole side of "
"the bar was enjoying MY fire without paying me anything. Enraged I went from "
"person to person grabbing their cigarettes from their hands, throwing them "
"to the ground, and stamping on them."
