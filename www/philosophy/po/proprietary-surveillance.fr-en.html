<h2>Proprietary Surveillance</h2>

<p>Clearly established cases of proprietary software that spies on or
tracks users:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spyware in Windows: <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/28/windows_update_keeps_tabs/">
Windows Update snoops on the user.</a>
<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/t/microsoft-windows/look-the-black-underbelly-of-windows-81-blue-222175">Windows 8.1 snoops on local searches.</a>.
And there's a <a href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article40836.html">secret NSA key in Windows</a>, whose functions we don't know.
</li>
<li>Spyware in Angry Birds: <a
href="http://confabulator.blogspot.com/2012/11/analysis-of-what-information-angry.html">
http://confabulator.blogspot.com/2012/11/analysis-of-what-information-angry.html</a>
</li>
<li>Spyware in many e-readers&mdash;not only the Kindle: <a
href="https://www.eff.org/pages/reader-privacy-chart-2012">
they report even which page the user reads at what time</a>.
</li>
<li>Spyware
in <a href="http://doctorbeet.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html">
LG &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TVs</a> reports what the user watches, and the
switch to turn this off has no effect.  (The fact that the transmission reports a 404 error really means nothing;
the server could save that data anyway.)
<p> Even worse, it <a href="http://rambles.renney.me/2013/11/lg-tv-logging-filenames-from-network-folders/">
snoops on
other devices</a> on the user's local network.
</p>
<p>
LG later said it installed a patch to stop this, but it can happen in
any product.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://consumerman.com/Rent-to-own%20giant%20accused%20of%20spying%20on%20its%20customers.htm">
Rent-to-own computers were programmed to spy on their renters</a>.
</li>
<li>Spyware in Skype: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/20/project-chess-how-u-s-snoops-on-your-skype/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/20/project-chess-how-u-s-snoops-on-your-skype/</a>.
Microsoft changed Skype <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">specifically for spying</a>.
</li>
<li>Flash Player's feature that helps web sites track visitors: <a
href="http://www.imasuper.com/66/technology/flash-cookies-the-silent-privacy-killer/">
http://www.imasuper.com/66/technology/flash-cookies-the-silent-privacy-killer/</a>
<p>
It is also used for
<a
href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/top-sites-and-maybe-the-nsa-track-users-with-device-fingerprinting/">
&ldquo;fingerprinting&rdquo; devices </a> to identify users.
</p>
<p>Javascript code is another method of &ldquo;fingerprinting&rdquo;
devices.</p>
</li>

<li><a href="http://japandailypress.com/government-warns-agencies-against-using-chinas-baidu-application-after-data-transmissions-discovered-2741553/">
Baidu's Japanese-input and Chinese-input apps spy on users.</a>
</li>

<li>FTC says most mobile apps for children don't respect privacy: <a
href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/ftc-disclosures-severely-lacking-in-kids-mobile-appsand-its-getting-worse/">
http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/ftc-disclosures-severely-lacking-in-kids-mobile-appsand-its-getting-worse/</a>
</li>
<li>The Brightest Flashlight app <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/06/android-app-50m-downloads-sent-data-advertisers">
sends user data, including geolocation, for use by companies.</a>
<p>
The FTC criticized this app because it asked the user to approve
sending personal data to the app developer but did not ask about
sending it to other companies.  This shows the weakness of the
reject-it-if-you-dislike-snooping &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to
surveillance: why should a flashlight app send any information to
anyone?  A free software flashlight app would not.</p>
</li>

<li>Spyware in Cisco TNP IP
phones: <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/12/29/your-cisco-phone-is-listening.html">
http://boingboing.net/2012/12/29/your-cisco-phone-is-listening.html</a>
</li>
<li>Spyware in Android phones (and Windows? laptops): The Wall Street
Journal (in an article blocked from us by a paywall) reports
that<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/1/4580718/fbi-can-remotely-activate-android-and-laptop-microphones-reports-wsj">the
FBI can remotely activate the GPS and microphone in Android phones and
laptops</a>.  (I suspect this means Windows laptops.)  Here
is <a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/08/fbi-hackers.htm">more info
</a>.
</li>
<li>Portable phones with GPS will send their GPS location on remote
command and users cannot stop
them: <a href="http://www.aclu.org/government-location-tracking-cell-phones-gps-devices-and-license-plate-readers">
http://www.aclu.org/government-location-tracking-cell-phones-gps-devices-and-license-plate-readers</a>.
(The US says it will eventually require all new portable phones to
have GPS.)
</li>
<li>The nonfree Snapchat app's principal purpose is to restrict the
use of data on the user's computer, but it does surveillance too:
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/27/snapchat-may-be-exposed-hackers">
it tries to get the user's list of other people's phone numbers.</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, many web sites spy on their visitors.  Web sites are
not programs, so it <a
href="/philosophy/network-services-arent-free-or-nonfree.html"> makes
no sense to call them &ldquo;free&rdquo; or
&ldquo;proprietary&rdquo;</a>, but the surveillance is an abuse all
the same.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pages that contain &ldquo;Like&rdquo; buttons <a
href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/facebooks-privacy-lie-aussie-exposes-tracking-as-new-patent-uncovered-20111004-1l61i.html">
enable Facebook to track visitors to those pages</a>&mdash;even
users that don't have Facebook accounts.</li>
<li>Many web sites rat their visitors to advertising networks that
track users.  Of the top 1000 web sites, <a
href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/15402.htm">93% fed their
visitors third-party cookies, allowing other sites to track them</a>.
</li>
<li>Many web sites report all their visitors to Google by using the
Google Analytics service, which <a
href="http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/434164/google_analytics_breaks_norwegian_privacy_laws_local_agency_said/">
tells Google the IP address and the page that was visited.</a></li>
<li>Many web sites try to collect users' address books (the user's
list of other people's phone numbers or email addresses).  This
violates the privacy of those other people.</li>
</ul>
