<h2>Proprietary Surveillance</h2>

<p>Clearly established cases of proprietary software that spies on or
tracks users:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spyware in Windows: <a

</li>
<li>Spyware in Angry Birds: <a

</li>
<li>Spyware in many e-readers&mdash;not only the Kindle: <a

</li>
<li>Flash Player's feature that helps web sites track visitors: <a

</li>
<li>FTC says most mobile apps for children don't respect privacy: <a

</li>
<li>Spyware in Cisco TNP IP phones: <a

http://boingboing.net/2012/12/29/your-cisco-phone-is-listening.html</a>
</li>
<li>Most portable phones will send their GPS location on remote
command and users cannot stop them: <a
href="http://www.aclu.org/government-location-tracking-cell-phones-gps-devices-and-license-plate-readers">
http://www.aclu.org/government-location-tracking-cell-phones-gps-devices-and-license-plate-readers</a>.  (The US requires all new portable phones
to have GPS; this requirement has existed for many years.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, many web sites spy on their visitors.  Web sites are
not programs, so it <a
href="/philosophy/network-services-arent-free-or-nonfree.html"> makes
no sense to call them &ldquo;free&rdquo; or
&ldquo;proprietary&rdquo;</a>, but the surveillance is an abuse all
the same.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pages that contain &ldquo;Like&rdquo; buttons <a
href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/facebooks-privacy-lie-aussie-exposes-tracking-as-new-patent-uncovered-20111004-1l61i.html">
enable Facebook to track visitors to those pages</a>&mdash;even
users that don't have Facebook accounts.</li>
<li>Many web sites rat their visitors to advertising networks that
track users.  Of the top 1000 web sites, <a
href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/15402.htm">93% fed their
visitors third-party cookies, allowing other sites to track them</a>.
</li>
<li>Many web sites report all their visitors to Google by using the
Google Analytics service, which <a
href="http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/434164/google_analytics_breaks_norwegian_privacy_laws_local_agency_said/">
tells Google the IP address and the page that was visited.</a></li>
</ul>

     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
