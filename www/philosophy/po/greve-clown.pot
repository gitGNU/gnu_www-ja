"During the preparation of this speech I have read several documents and "

"seems that a basic awareness of the roots has been lost. Tonight I hope I'll "
"be able to uncover some of those roots again."

"The origin lies somewhere in the transition from the 70's to the 80's, when "
"the software industry became what we accept so willingly today. In the "
"initial competition, some firms took to hording code as a survival "
"strategy. While attempting to support this behaviour's legality, they "
"created phrases like &ldquo;Software Piracy&rdquo; because they suggest that "
"something is lost when software is copied. People were forced to yield to "
"licenses that bound them to make sure that no one else had access to these "
"programs."

"When a friend asked you whether he could copy a program from you, you "
"immediately faced a dilemma. There are no disadvantages for you in copying "
"the program, and it doesn't deteriorate during the copying process&hellip; "
"it would be more restrictive if he asked you to pass the salt, since you "
"can't both use it at the same time. The politics of the companies forced you "
"to <b>choose</b> between legality and friendship."

"A lot of people were upset about this and most of them copied the program "
"anyway&mdash;very often using lame excuses that were mostly aimed at calming "
"their own troubled consciousness (induced by the firms' choice of "
"words). The absolute hit was probably &ldquo;If I would use it more often I "
"would pay it&rdquo; &hellip; a phrase that probably everyone caught himself "
"using if he ever had to rely on proprietary software."

"One man found this situation unbearable. Used to the early days, the (as he "
"says himself) &ldquo;paradise,&rdquo;, where freedom and responsible use of "
"the possibilities determined the situation, Richard Stallman envisioned the "
"concept of a completely free system. Very quickly it became clear that this "
"system would be Unix-compatible and it was baptized&mdash;recursive acronyms "
"were very popular back then&mdash;GNU, which means &ldquo;GNU's Not "
"Unix.&rdquo;"

"Since first of all a Unix system requires a large set of components, it "
"became clear that these were the the first step towards a completely free "
"system. The GNU FSF worked on implementing them, and by the beginning of the "
"90's the GNU system was complete (with the exception of the kernel)."

"The GNU kernel&mdash;project name &ldquo;HURD&rdquo;&mdash;has an extremely "
"ambitious layout that proved to be very slow and clumsy in "
"development. Fortunately at this point Linus Torvalds's first Linux kernel "
"was in the test phase, and when he saw the work already done by the GNU FSF "
"he put his kernel under the GNU GPL and made it the kernel of the GNU "
"system."

"The &ldquo;Free&rdquo; in Free Software does not refer to the price but to "
"&ldquo;Freedom&rdquo;. This is no unproblematic topic and recently some of "
"the visionaries of the movement (like Eric Raymond)  have begun to talk "
"about &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; because &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; has an uneasy "
"sound to it for most people. Freedom rings of &ldquo;making world a better "
"place&rdquo; and insecurity. It rings of change, and change frightens many "
"people.  To numb this fear, other licenses for free software have been "
"invented in order to make the concept digestible for more people and to "
"avoid scaring the industry."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"That is the reason why the GNU Project dislikes the term &ldquo;Open "
"Source.&rdquo; We think it makes more sense to take away people's fears of "
"the idea instead of blurring the concept. Only if users and firms are aware "
"of the importance of freedom can we avoid falling back into old patterns."

"The philosophy of the GNU Project says that <b>everyone</b> shall have the "
"granted right to use a program, to copy it, and to change it to make it fit "
"his or her needs. The <b>only</b> restriction the GNU General Public License "
"makes, is that <b>NO ONE</b> has the right to take away this freedom from "
"anyone else."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"When an author puts his code under the GNU GPL, the freedom is an "
"inseperable part of his program. Of course, this is a thorn in the side of a "
"lot of businesses eyes because it stops them from taking the code, modifying "
"it, and then selling it as a proprietary program. As long as there are "
"people who try to live the dream of instant wealth it is this freedom that "
"stops firms like Microsoft from corrupting the future development of our "
"system."

"The most used argument against the GNU Philosophy is probably that software "
"is the &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; of the programmer and it is only "
"right if he can decide the price for which the program is distributed. This "
"argument is easy to understand for everyone since it is exactly what we have "
"been told to believe during the last 20 years."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Reality is a little different, though. Private programmers who can live off "
"selling self-written software are the exception. Usually they give their "
"rights to the firm they work at and this firm earns the money by restricting "
"access to that program. Effectively, the firm has the rights for that "
"program and decides it's price &mdash;not the programmer."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"A lawyer who invents an especially brilliant strategy has no right to claim "
"it as his &ldquo;intellectual property;&rdquo; the method is freely "
"available to anyone. Why do we so willingly accept the concept that every "
"line of code&mdash;no matter how poorly written or uninspired it may "
"be&mdash;is so unique and incredibly personal ? The zeal for control has "
"taken over in a way that even human genes are subject to "
"patents&hellip;although usually not by the people who &ldquo;use&rdquo; "
"them. Should really <b>everything</b> be allowed to be patented and "
"licensed?"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This is the question that is one of the core thoughts of the GNU "
"Project. Let us just imagine there would be no such concept as patented "
"software or patenting software would be unusual because everyone published "
"his programs under the GNU GPL."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Solutions for standard problems that had to be solved over and over again "
"can be accessed easily. No one has to waste his time ever again to work on "
"the same problem dozens of times&mdash;programmers could search for new ways "
"and approach new problems. If a group of users needs a certain feature in a "
"program they just hire a programmer and let him implement it. Freed of the "
"limitations of licenses and money only two criteria would determine the "
"development of programs: demand and quality."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Speaking of quality&mdash;nowadays more and more firms realize that allowing "
"the users to access the sourcecode gives them a huge advantage. To say it in "
"a simple way: more eyes can see more. Solutions that are unimaginable for "
"one person are painfully obvious for someone else. Due to this advantage "
"Free Software is very often so much better than its proprietary "
"counterpart.  The train of thought that now appears to be establishing "
"itself within some firms is to give users access to the source code but not "
"grant any other rights. Improvements are obediently being sent back to the "
"firm that advances it's product with them. Basically as a gigantic gratis "
"development division. If we do not pay attention to these things <b>now</b> "
"it might happen that in 5 years we will have to pay for a version that has "
"been produced by applying our own patch."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"The concept of software as &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; carries the "
"seed of doom inside itself (please forgive me for the pathos here).  As long "
"as we accept this concept, we accept the danger that another firm will "
"attempt to take control.  Microsoft is <em>not</em> evil incarnate as some "
"people seem to percieve. Microsoft is <em>the natural consequence</em> of "
"the widely accepted system."

"The fear of sawing the branch you're sitting on is also commonly spread, but "
"completely irrational. Better programs lead to more users that have other "
"needs and new ideas, creating more demand. The structure will change to fit "
"the new situation but work will increase rather than decrease&mdash;and it "
"will become less routine and hence more interesting."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The last common fear that remains is the fear over lack of "
"recognition. Well, the respect held for the frontmen of the different "
"philosophies speaks for itself. I on my part would prefer to be as respected "
"as Linus Thorvalds or Richard Stallman than having the reputation of Bill "
"Gates."

"Admittedly, this does sound like bettering the world and idealism, but a lot "

"And to settle one point very clearly: no, the GNU Project is not agains "
"capitalism or firms in general and it is not against software firms in "
"particular. We do not want to diminish the potential for profit&mdash;quite "
"to the contrary. Every firm is being told to make as much money as they can "
"off the sale of software, the documentation and the service&mdash;as long as "
"they stick to the basic principles of Free Software."
msgstr ""

"The more these firms earn the more they can invest into the development of "
"new software. We do not want to destroy the market, we just want to fit it "

"One short note about the basic principles: of course Free Software also "
"requires free documentation. It doesn't make any sense to free the successor "
"of the book&mdash;software&mdash;while accepting control of the direct "
"digital equivalent. Free documentation is as important as Free Software "
"itself."

"Maybe someone discarded my statement about seeking to &ldquo;fit the market "

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"the time when software was only relevant for a few freaks and some firms is "
"long gone. Nowadays software is the pathway to information. A system that "
"blocks the pathways to information and in doing so the access to the "
"information itself <b>must</b> be reconsidered."

"When Eric Raymond published the so called &ldquo;Halloween Document&rdquo; "
"it triggered emotions from euphoria to paranoia. For those of you who did "
"not read it: it is a Microsoft internal study in which the strengths and "
"weaknesses of Free Software in general and Linux especially are "
"analyzed. The author basically concluded that Microsoft has two "
"possibilities to counter the threat."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The first is the creation of new or modification of old protocols "
"documenting them only poorly or not at all, so that only Windows-based "
"machines will have a working implementation."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One example of this tactic is the protocol used by HP &ldquo;Cxi&rdquo; "
"printers which have entered the market as extremely cheap "
"&ldquo;Windows-Printers.&rdquo; The specifications have only been given to "
"Microsoft, so these printers are not usable by any other system."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"I have been told by a &ldquo;professionally trained&rdquo; computer "
"salesperson that the &ldquo;for Windows&rdquo; sticker means that the "
"printer needs a very special kind of RAM that only Windows machines "
"have&mdash;that's why it cannot be used under Linux. Something like this "
"confuses the typical user, which brings me directly to the second described "
"tactic."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"These tactics are usually gathered under the synonym &ldquo;FUD&rdquo; (Fear "
"Uncertainty Doubt) and were used by IBM long before Microsoft unconvered "
"them. The idea is clear: If you make someone uncertain enough, he or she "
"will not dare to make <b>any</b> decission, effectively remaining in his or "
"her current position. That is the thought."

"The most recogniziable split in the recent history has been the already "
"noted distinction between &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free "

"With the completion of the GNU System with the Linux Kernel there was "
"suddenly a complete, powerful, free system available. This inevitably had to "
"raise the public's attention sooner or later."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"When this attention came a lot of firms were disconcerted by the word "
"&ldquo;Free.&rdquo; The first association was &ldquo;no money&rdquo; which "
"immediatly meant &ldquo;no profit&rdquo; for them. When people then tried to "
"tell them the &ldquo;Free&rdquo; truly stands for &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; they "
"were completely shaken."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Infected by this insecurity and doubt the idea arose to avoid words like "

"But it has the consequence that the &ldquo;newbies&rdquo; have no knowledge "

"A larger interested audience does not mean we should talk less about the "

"It is crucial to explain to the firms that Free Software is <b>no "
