"When I was in grade school, right here in the United States of America, I "
"was taught that our country was the &ldquo;land of opportunity&rdquo;.  My "
"teachers told me that my country was special, because anyone with a good "
"idea and a drive to do good work could make a living, and be successful "
"too.  They called it the &ldquo;American Dream&rdquo;."

"What was the cornerstone to the &ldquo;American Dream&rdquo;? It was "
"equality&mdash;everyone had the same chance in our society to choose their "
"own way.  I could have any career I wanted, and if I worked hard, I would be "
"successful."

"It turned out that I had some talent for working with computers&mdash;in "
"particular, computer software.  Indoctrinated with the &ldquo;American "
"Dream&rdquo;, I learned as much as I could about computer software.  I "
"wanted my chance at success."

"I quickly discovered though, that in many cases, not all the players in the "
"field of computer software were equal.  By the time I entered the field, "
"large companies like Microsoft tended to control much of the technology.  "
"And, that technology was available to me under licensing agreements that "
"forbid me to study and learn from it.  I was completely prohibited from "
"viewing the program source code of the software."

"I found out, too, that those with lots of money could negotiate different "
"licenses.  If they paid enough, they could get permission to study and learn "
"from the source code.  Typically, such licenses cost many thousands of "
"dollars, and being young and relatively poor, I was out of luck."

"After spending my early years in the software business a bit downtrodden by "
"my inability to learn more, I eventually discovered another body of software "
"that did allow me to study and learn.  This software was released under a "
"license called the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).  Instead of "
"restricting my freedom to study and learn from it, this license was "
"specifically designed to allow me to learn.  The license ensured that no "
"matter what happened to the public versions of the software, I'd always be "
"able to study its source code."

"I quickly built my career around this software.  I got lots of work "
"configuring, installing, administering, and teaching about that software.  "
"Thanks to the GNU GPL, I always knew that I could stay competitive in my "
"business, because I would always be able to learn easily about new "
"innovations as soon as they were made.  This gave me a unique ability to "
"innovate myself.  I could innovate quickly, and impress my employers.  I was "
"even able to start my own consulting business.  My own business! The "
"pinnacle of the American Dream!"

"The GNU GPL is specifically designed to make sure that all technological "
"innovators, programmers, and software users are given equal footing.  Each "
"high school student, independent contractor, small business, and large "
"corporation are given an equal chance to innovate.  We all start the race "
"from the same point.  Those people with deep understanding of the software "
"and an ability to make it work well for others are most likely to succeed, "
"and they do succeed."

"That is exactly what the American Way is about, at least the way I learned "
"it in grade school.  I hope that we won't let Microsoft and others change "
"the definition."
