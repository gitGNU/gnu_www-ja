"&ldquo;Gnutella&rdquo; is, at present, the name for a protocol for "
"distributed file sharing, mostly used for music files.  The name also "
"sometimes refers to the network itself, as well as the original Gnutella "
"software.  The situation is quite confusing.  For more on Gnutella's origin "
"and history, please refer to the <a "
"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella\">Wikipedia article</a> on the "
"subject."

"In any case, the name was originally a word play on &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; (the "
"original developers planned to release their code under the GNU GPL, and may "
"have had in mind contributing it to the GNU project) and "
"&ldquo;Nutella&rdquo; (a candy bar that the original developers enjoyed).  "
"However, neither the original software nor any of the related current "
"projects are <a href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#GNUsoftware\">official "
"GNU packages</a>.  We have asked that the Gnutella developers change the "
"name to avoid confusion; perhaps that will happen in the future."

"There are a number of free software programs that implement the Gnutella "
"protocol, such as <a "
"href=\"http://gtk-gnutella.sourceforge.net/\">gtk-gnutella</a>, <a "
"href=\"http://mutella.sourceforge.net/\">mutella</a>, and <a "
"href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucleus/\">gnucleus</a>.  Please "
"note, however, that none of these programs are officially <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#GNUsoftware\">GNU software</a> either.  "
"GNU has its own peer-to-peer networking program, <a "
"href=\"/software/GNUnet/\">GNUnet</a>, whose documentation includes a <a "
"href=\"https://gnunet.org/compare\">comparison of the protocols</a>."

"The Free Software Foundation is concerned with the freedom to copy and "
"change software; music is outside our scope.  But there is a partial "
"similarity in the ethical issues of copying software and copying recordings "
"of music.  Some articles in the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/philosophy.html#Laws\">philosophy</a> directory relate to "
"the issue of copying for things other than software.  Some of the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/philosophy.html#ThirdPartyIdeas\">other people's "
"articles</a> we have links to are also relevant."

"No matter what sort of published information is being shared, we urge people "
"to reject the assumption that some person or company has a natural right to "
"prohibit sharing and dictate exactly how the public can use it.  Even the US "
"legal system nominally <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/reevaluating-copyright.html\">rejects</a> that "
"anti-social idea."
