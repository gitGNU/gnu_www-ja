"For several years I've said in my speeches that it was a crime in France, "
"punishable by imprisonment, to have a copy of the free software that can "
"decrypt the video on a DVD. That encryption is an example of DRM (Digital "
"Restrictions Management), the malicious features <a "
"href=\"http://DefectiveByDesign.org/\">designed to restrict users</a>."

"That is what Sarkozy's DADVSI law said when it was adopted, but I recently "
"learned that the Conseil d'Etat introduced some exceptions. In fact, free "
"software to decrypt and play DVDs is legally distributed in "
"France&mdash;unlike the US, where it was censored by the infamous 1998 law, "
"the Digital Millennium Copyright Act."

"However, it's not clear whether this will apply to other DRM schemes.  There "
"is a danger that the complex conditions will specifically prohibit free "
"software for playing Bluray disks and allow only proprietary software. Thus, "
"it is not a crime in France to possess the free software that can play a "
"DVD, but it is yet to be decided whether it is a crime to possess a free "
"program to play a Bluray disk."

"It is certainly not <em>wrong</em> to have a copy of such a program.  The "
"software that's wrong is nonfree software; the only ethical program to play "
"a video, or do anything else, is a free program. The wrong here is in the "
"law itself. However, as long as it exists, if you are a dissident in France "
"you should keep such programs hidden."

"When I first got a drive that handles DVDs, the reason I decided not to "
"install free DVD-playing software was because of this French law.  I go to "
"France from time to time, and I was concerned there might be some who would "
"wish to have me imprisoned for this so as to terrorize other netizens. I "
"refuse to have any nonfree software, and the only option that left me was to "
"have no software for this job. Thus, I could not play encrypted DVDs at all."

"Knowing now that I won't be imprisoned for bringing libdvdcss into France, I "
"could consider having a copy, which would give me the option of playing DVDs "

"However, I think I won't do it. I have got used to avoiding encrypted DVDs, "
"and this has the bonus of giving Hollywood no money with which to lobby for "
"nasty laws like SOPA. Why change?"
