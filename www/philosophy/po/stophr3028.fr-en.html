   This bill fits a pattern: every time Congress wants to create a new
   monopoly covering some activity formerly open to all, or extend and
   increase an old monopoly, they apply the term &ldquo;piracy&rdquo;
   to the free activity that the monopoly will stamp out.  So whenever
   you see anything described as &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; aside from the
   capturing of ships, watch out for your liberties!  -- Richard
   Stallman

<h3>Urgent</h3>

<p>
        The House of Representatives is about to vote on legislation
        that would grant sweeping new powers for trademark holders and
        undermine the rights of domain name holders, Internet users,
        and small businesses.  H.R. 3028 &ldquo;The Trademark
        Cyberpiracy Prevention Act of 1999&rdquo; will also establish
        unprecedented ability for trademark holders to sue Internet
        users all around the world.  And H.R. 32028 will undermine a
        fair and carefully crafted international consensus on the
        resolution of Internet name disputes.  It's a bad bill and it
        should be stopped.</p>
<p>
         The House of Representatives may vote on H.R. 3028 as early as
        Tuesday, October 26, 1999.</p>

<h3>You Need To Act</h3>

<p>
        There is a chance to stop HR 3028. It has very few sponsors
        and has moved quietly through Congress, mostly under the radar
        of organizations and businesses that have worked to promote
        the growth of the Internet.  Also, Congress will soon break
        for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>
        But you have to act!</p>

<h3>What You Can Do</h3>

<p>
        It is vitally important for you to contact your Representative
        in Congress and explain politely but firmly that you hope that
        your Representative will VOTE AGAINST H.R. 3028.</p>
<p>
      Here is a quick guide to Calling Your Congressman.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Call the Capitol Hill Switchboard (202-224-3121) and
       ask to speak to your Congressman. (Don't know who your
       Congressman is? Ok, go <a href="http://www.house.gov/writerep/">here</a>)</li>

  <li>When you reach the office say to the person who answers
       the phone:<p>

       &ldquo;Hello, I'm a registered voter in the district of
       Congressman &lt;name&gt;. I'm calling because I hope he/she
       will vote against H.R. 3028, &lsquo;The Cyberpiracy Act&rsquo;.
       I don't like cyberpirates, but I believe this bill will hurt
       ALL domain name holders on the Internet, including small
       businesses, noncommercial organizations and individuals.  Will
       you please tell the Congressman that I asked him/her to vote
       against H.R. 3028?  Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Here are all the things you just did in 30 seconds:</p>
       <ul>
	 <li>You made clear that you're a voter in the Congressman's
	      District (they'll listen to you!)</li>
	 <li>You said clearly that you are against a bill and you gave
	      the bill number and the title of the bill (it's important to
	      give both!)</li>
	 <li>You gave the Congressman a good reason to vote against
	      H.R. 3028 (Members of Congress like good reasons for votes)</li>
	 <li>You asked for a commitment to convey your position to the
	      Congressman (you want to be taken seriously)</li>
	 <li>You were polite (always a plus)</li>
	 <li>If you leave your name and address, that will make your call
	      even more effective (you might even get a letter)</li>
       </ul>
  </li>

  <li>If you like, you can also send an email to your Representative
       with a new service offered at the House web site &mdash; check
       <a href="http://www.house.gov/writerep/">here</a>.</li>

  <li>If you're still energized to do something, ask a friend or
       neighbor who also lives in your district to make the same
       call. You can also call the office of the Chairman of the
       Rules Committee Congressman David Dreier and tell his
       staffperson that you oppose H.R. 3028 and hope that Mr.
       Dreier will put off a vote on the bill until the problems
       are fixed.</li>

  <li>If you want to learn more about the problems with H.R. 3028,
       look at the excellent letter from computer users and legal
       experts. Also, visit Thomas and check out the bill and the
       history.</li>
