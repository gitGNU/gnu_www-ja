"<em>Free software</em> means that the software's users have freedom.  (The "

"Specifically, free software means users have the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">four essential freedoms</a>: (0) to run "
"the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to "
"redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions."

"Software differs from material objects&mdash;such as chairs, sandwiches, and "
"gasoline&mdash;in that it can be copied and changed much more easily.  These "
"facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should "
"be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer."
