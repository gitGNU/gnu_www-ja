"Free software is a matter of freedom: people should be free to use software "
"in all the ways that are socially useful.  Software differs from material "
"objects&mdash;such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline&mdash;in that it can "
"be copied and changed much more easily.  These possibilities make software "
"as useful as it is; we believe software users should be able to make use of "
"them."
