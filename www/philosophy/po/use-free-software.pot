"It was 5 Jan 1984, twenty years ago today, that I quit my job at MIT to "
"begin developing a free software operating system, <a "
"href=\"/gnu/the-gnu-project.html\">GNU</a>.  While we have never released a "
"complete GNU system suitable for production use, a variant of the GNU system "
"is now used by tens of millions of people who mostly are not aware it is "
"such.  Free software does not mean &ldquo;gratis&rdquo;; it means that users "
"are free to run the program, study the source code, change it, and "
"redistribute it either with or without changes, either gratis or for a fee."

"My hope was that a free operating system would open a path to escape forever "
"from the system of subjugation which is proprietary software.  I had "
"experienced the ugliness of the way of life that non-free software imposes "
"on its users, and I was determined to escape and give others a way to "
"escape."

"Non-free software carries with it an antisocial system that prohibits "
"cooperation and community.  You are typically unable to see the source code; "
"you cannot tell what nasty tricks, or what foolish bugs, it might contain.  "
"If you don't like it, you are helpless to change it.  Worst of all, you are "
"forbidden to share it with anyone else.  To prohibit sharing software is to "
"cut the bonds of society."

"Today we have a large community of users who run GNU, Linux and other free "
"software.  Thousands of people would like to extend this, and have adopted "
"the goal of convincing more computer users to &ldquo;use free "
"software&rdquo;.  But what does it mean to &ldquo;use free software&rdquo;? "
"Does that mean escaping from proprietary software, or merely installing free "
"programs alongside it? Are we aiming to lead people to freedom, or just "
"introduce them to our code? In other words, are we working for freedom, or "
"have we replaced that goal with the shallow goal of popularity?"

"It's easy to get in the habit of overlooking this distinction, because in "
"many common situations it makes no difference.  When you're trying to "
"convince a person to try a free program, or to install the <a "
"href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux</a> operating system, either goal "
"would lead to the same practical conduct.  However, in other situations the "
"two goals inspire very different actions."

"For instance, what should we say when the non-free Invidious video driver, "
"the non-free Prophecy database, or the non-free Indonesia language "
"interpreter and libraries, is released in a version that runs on GNU/Linux? "
"Should we thank the developers for this &ldquo;support&rdquo; for our "
"system, or should we regard this non-free program like any other&mdash;as an "
"attractive nuisance, a temptation to accept bondage, a problem to be solved?"

"If you take as your goal the increased popularity of certain free software, "
"if you seek to convince more people to use some free programs some of the "
"time, you might think those non-free programs are helpful contributions to "
"that goal.  It is hard to dispute the claim that their availability helps "
"make GNU/Linux more popular.  If the widespread use of GNU or Linux is the "
"ultimate goal of our community, we should logically applaud all applications "
"that run on it, whether free or not."

"But if our goal is freedom, that changes everything.  Users cannot be free "
"while using a non-free program.  To free the citizens of cyberspace, we have "
"to replace those non-free programs, not accept them.  They are not "
"contributions to our community, they are temptations to settle for "

"There are two common motivations to develop a free program.  One is that "
"there is no program to do the job.  Unfortunately, accepting the use of a "
"non-free program eliminates that motivation.  The other is the will to be "
"free, which motivates people to write free replacements for non-free "
"programs.  In cases like these, that motive is the only one that can do the "
"job.  Simply by using a new and unfinished free replacement, before it "
"technically compares with the non-free model, you can help encourage the "
"free developers to persevere until it becomes superior."

"Those non-free programs are not trivial.  Developing free replacements for "
"them will be a big job; it may take years.  The work may need the help of "
"future hackers, young people today, people yet to be inspired to join the "
"work on free software.  What can we do today to help convince other people, "
"in the future, to maintain the necessary determination and persistance to "
"finish this work?"

"The most effective way to strengthen our community for the future is to "
"spread understanding of the value of freedom&mdash;to teach more people to "
"recognize the moral unacceptability of non-free software.  People who value "
"freedom are, in the long term, its best and essential defense."
