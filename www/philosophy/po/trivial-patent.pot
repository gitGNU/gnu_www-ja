"Programmers are well aware that many of the existing software patents cover "
"laughably obvious ideas. Yet the patent system's defenders often argue that "
"these ideas are nontrivial, obvious only in hindsight. And it is "
"surprisingly difficult to defeat them in debate. Why is that?"

"One reason is that any idea can be made to look complex when analyzed to "
"death. Another reason is that these trivial ideas often look quite complex "
"as described in the patents themselves. The patent system's defenders can "
"point to the complex description and say, &ldquo;How can anything this "
"complex be obvious?&rdquo;"

"A RAID array is a group of disks set up to work like one big disk, with the "

"1996, and are a standard way of storing data for high availability.  But "

"Trivial as it is, this patent would not necessarily be found legally invalid "
"if there is a lawsuit about it.  Not only the US Patent Office but the "
"courts as well tend to apply a very low standard when judging whether a "
"patent is &ldquo;unobvious&rdquo;.  This patent might pass muster, according "
"to them."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"What's more, the courts are reluctant to overrule the Patent Office, so "
"there is a better chance of getting a patent overturned if you can show a "
"court prior art that the Patent Office did not consider.  If the courts are "
"willing to entertain a higher standard in judging unobviousness, it helps to "
"save the prior art for them.  Thus, the proposals to &ldquo;make the system "
"work better&rdquo; by providing the Patent Office with a better database of "
"prior art could instead make things worse."

"It is very hard to make a patent system behave reasonably; it is a complex "
"bureaucracy and tends to follow its structural imperatives regardless of "
"what it is &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to do.  The only practical way to get rid "
"of the many obvious patents on software features and business practices is "
"to get rid of all patents in those fields.  Fortunately, that would be no "
"loss: the unobvious patents in the software field do no good either.  What "
"software patents do is put software developers and users under threat."

"The patent system is supposed, intended, to promote progress, and those who "
"benefit from software patents ask us to believe without question that they "
"do have that effect.  But programmers' experience shows otherwise.  New "
"theoretical analysis shows that this is no paradox.  (See <a "
"href=\"http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf\"> "
"http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf</a>.)  There is no reason why "
"society should expose software developers and users to the danger of "
"software patents."
