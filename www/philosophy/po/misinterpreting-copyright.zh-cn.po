"But we don't have to apply the same time span to all kinds of works.  "
"Maintaining the utmost uniformity of copyright policy is not crucial to the "

"Another dimension of copyright policy is the extent of fair use: some ways "
"of reproducing all or part of a published work that are legally permitted "
"even though it is copyrighted.  The natural first step in reducing this "
"dimension of copyright power is to permit occasional private small-quantity "
"noncommercial copying and distribution among individuals.  This would "
"eliminate the intrusion of the copyright police into people's private lives, "
"but would probably have little effect on the sales of published works.  (It "
"may be necessary to take other legal steps to ensure that shrink-wrap "
"licenses cannot be used to substitute for copyright in restricting such "
"copying.)  The experience of Napster shows that we should also permit "
"noncommercial verbatim redistribution to the general public&mdash;when so "
