"Companies that develop free software and release it under the GNU GPL "
"sometimes distribute some copies of the code in other ways.  If they "
"distribute the exact same code under a different license to certain users "
"that pay for this, typically permitting including the code in proprietary "
"programs, we call it &ldquo;selling exceptions&rdquo;.  If they distribute "
"some version of the code solely in a proprietary manner, we call that "
"releasing a purely proprietary version of the program."

"<a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html\">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html</a> "
"explains why selling exceptions is acceptable, though only barely.  By "
"contrast, releasing a purely proprietary version is outright wrong, like any "
"other proprietary software."

"Companies normally sell exceptions using code they themselves have "
"developed.  Since they hold the copyright on that code, they can legally "
"distribute it in any manner, even in multiple manners in parallel.  But what "
"happens when you publish a modified version of that free program, and the "
"company wants to include your changes in its version?"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Since you got the program under the GPL, when you distribute a modified "
"version you have to license it under the GPL.  If the company receives a "
"copy, it will be able to use those changes under the GPL; it won't be "
"allowed to include your changes in that program and sell exceptions for it.  "
"It also won't be able to release purely proprietary versions containing your "
"code.  If this is the outcome you want, you get it by default.  However, if "
"the company intends to sell exceptions, it will probably decide not to use "
"your changes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Suppose, though, that you're not opposed to selling exceptions and you're "
"willing to let the company do so while including your changes in the "
"program.  You can agree to this, but you need to be careful about what you "
"sign, or you may be surprised by the results."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The company will probably invite you to assign or license your copyright to "
"the company.  That in itself is not inherently bad; for instance, many GNU "
"software developers have assigned copyrights to the FSF.  However, the FSF "
"never sells exceptions, and its assignment contracts include a commitment to "
"distribute the contributor's code only with source and only permitting "
"redistribution."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The company's proposed contract may not include such a commitment.  It might "
"instead let the company use your changes any way it likes.  If you sign "
"that, the company could do various things with your code.  It could keep "
"selling exceptions for a program including your code.  It could release "
"purely proprietary modified or extended versions including your code.  It "
"could even include your code <em>only</em> in proprietary versions.  Your "
"contribution of code could turn out to be, in effect, a donation to "
"proprietary software."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"It is up to you which of these activities to permit, but here are the FSF's "
"recommendations.  If you plan to make major contributions to the project, "
"insist that the contribution agreement require that software versions "
"including your contributions be available to the public under a free "
"software license.  This will allow the developer to sell exceptions, but "
"prevent it from using your contributions in software that is only available "
"under a proprietary license."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"If your contributions are smaller, you could accept a weaker condition, that "
"the company make your contributions available in a free software release as "
"well as possibly in nonfree programs.  This would allow the company to use "
"your contributions in modified software that's only available under a "
"proprietary license.  Releasing proprietary software is never a good thing, "
"but if your changes are smaller, it might be more important to improve the "
"free version than resist the nonfree versions."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"You can control these outcomes by insisting on the proper conditions in the "
"contract.  To allow selling exceptions for the program that contains your "
"code, but refuse to let the company release purely proprietary versions "
"containing your code, you can insist on a condition more or less like this:"
