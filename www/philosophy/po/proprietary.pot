"Proprietary software, nonfree software, is software that doesn't respect "
"users' freedom and community.  The developer or owner has power over its "
"users.  That in itself is an injustice, but it often leads to further "
"injustice."

"Power corrupts, so the program's owner is tempted to put malicious "
"functionality into the program &mdash; that is, to make it "
"<em>malware</em>.  Malware means software whose functioning mistreats the "
"user.  This page gives examples of widely used proprietary programs that are "
"known to be malware."

"Since free software is controlled by its users, they have a pretty good "
