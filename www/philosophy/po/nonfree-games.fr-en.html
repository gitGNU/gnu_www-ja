<h2>Nonfree DRM'd Games on GNU/Linux: Good or Bad?</h2>

<p>by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a></p>

<p>A well known company, Valve, that distributes nonfree computer games
with Digital Restrictions Management, recently announced it would
distribute these games for GNU/Linux.  What good and bad effects can
this have?</p>

<p>I suppose that availability of popular nonfree programs on GNU/Linux
can boost adoption of the system.  However, our goal goes beyond making
this system a &ldquo;success&rdquo;; its purpose is to bring freedom to
the users.  Thus, the question is how this development affects users'
freedom.</p>

<p>Nonfree games (like other nonfree programs) are unethical because
they deny freedom to their users.  If you want freedom, one requisite
for it is not having these games on your computer.  That much is
clear.</p>

<p>However, if you're going to use these games, you're better off using
them on GNU/Linux rather than on Microsoft Windows.  At least you avoid
<a href="http://windows7sins.org/">the harm to your freedom that Windows
would do</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, in direct practical terms, this development can do both harm
and good.  It might encourage GNU/Linux users to install these games,
and it might encourage users of the games to replace Windows with
GNU/Linux.  My guess is that the direct good effect will be bigger than
the direct harm.  But there is also an indirect effect: what does the
use of these games teach people in our community?</p>

<p>Any GNU/Linux distro that comes with software to offer these games
will teach users that the point is not freedom.  <a
href="/distros/common-distros.html">Nonfree software in GNU/Linux
distros</a> already works against the goal of freedom.  Adding these
games to a distro would augment that effect.</p>

<p>If you want to promote freedom, please take care not to talk about
the availability of these games on GNU/Linux as support for our cause.
Instead you could tell people about
the <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/"> Liberated Pixel Cup</a>
free game contest, <a href="http://forum.freegamedev.net/index.php">
the Free Game Dev Forum</a>, and the LibrePlanet Gaming
Collective's <a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:LibrePlanet_Gaming_Collective">
free gaming night.</a> </p>
