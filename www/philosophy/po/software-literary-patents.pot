"When politicians consider the question of software patents, they are usually "
"voting blind; not being programmers, they don't understand what software "
"patents really do.  They often think patents are similar to copyright law "
"(&ldquo;except for some details&rdquo;)&mdash;which is not the case.  For "
"instance, when I publicly asked Patrick Devedjian, then Minister for "
"Industry in France, how France would vote on the issue of software patents, "
"Devedjian responded with an impassioned defense of copyright law, praising "
"Victor Hugo for his role in the adoption of copyright.  (The misleading term "
"<a href=\"/philosophy/not-ipr.html\"> &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo;</a> promotes this confusion&mdash;one of the reasons it "
"should never be used.)"

"A novel and a modern complex program have certain points in common: each one "
"is large, and implements many ideas in combination.  So let's follow the "
"analogy, and suppose that patent law had been applied to novels in the "
"1800s; suppose that states such as France had permitted the patenting of "
"literary ideas.  How would this have affected Victor Hugo's writing? How "
"would the effects of literary patents compare with the effects of literary "
"copyright?"

"Consider Victor Hugo's novel <cite> Les Mis&eacute;rables</cite>.  Since he "
"wrote it, the copyright belonged only to him.  He did not have to fear that "
"some stranger could sue him for copyright infringement and win.  That was "
"impossible, because copyright covers only the details of a work of "
"authorship, not the ideas embodied in them, and it only restricts copying.  "
"Hugo had not copied <cite>Les Mis&eacute;rables</cite>, so he was not in "
"danger from copyright."

"If such a patent had existed in 1862 when <cite>Les Mis&eacute;rables</cite> "
"was published, the novel would have conflicted with all three claims, since "
"all these things happened to Jean Valjean in the novel.  Victor Hugo could "
"have been sued, and if sued, he would have lost.  The novel could have been "
"prohibited&mdash;in effect, censored&mdash;by the patent holder."

"All three patents would cover, and prohibit, the life story of this one "
"character.  They overlap, but they do not precisely duplicate each other, so "

"You might think that these ideas are so simple that no patent office would "
"have issued them.  We programmers are often amazed by the simplicity of the "
"ideas that real software patents cover&mdash;for instance, the European "
"Patent Office has issued a patent on the progress bar, and a patent on "
"accepting payment via credit cards.  These patents would be laughable if "
"they were not so dangerous."

"Other aspects of <cite>Les Mis&eacute;rables</cite> could also have run "
"afoul of patents.  For instance, there could have been a patent on a "
"fictionalized portrayal of the Battle of Waterloo, or a patent on using "
"Parisian slang in fiction.  Two more lawsuits.  In fact, there is no limit "
"to the number of different patents that might have been applicable for suing "
"the author of a work such as <cite>Les Mis&eacute;rables</cite>.  All the "
"patent holders would say they deserved a reward for the literary progress "
"that their patented ideas represent, but these obstacles would not promote "
"progress in literature, they would only obstruct it."

"Who would the patent holders have been? They could have been other "
"novelists, perhaps Dumas or Balzac, who had written such novels&mdash;but "
"not necessarily.  It isn't required to write a program to patent a software "
"idea, so if our hypothetical literary patents follow the real patent system, "
"these patent holders would not have had to write novels, or stories, or "
"anything&mdash;except patent applications.  Patent parasite companies, "

"Given these broad patents, Victor Hugo would not have reached the point of "

"This analogy can help nonprogrammers see what software patents do. Software "
"patents cover features, such as defining abbreviations in a word processor, "
"or natural order recalculation in a spreadsheet.  Patents cover algorithms "
"that programs need to use.  Patents cover aspects of file formats, such as "
"Microsoft's OOXML format.  MPEG 2 video format is covered by 39 different US "
"patents."

"Just as one novel could run afoul of many different literary patents at "
"once, one program can be prohibited by many different patents at once.  It "
"is so much work to identify all the patents that appear to apply to a large "
"program that only one such study has been done.  A 2004 study of Linux, the "
"kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system, found 283 different US software "
"patents that seemed to cover it.  That is to say, each of these 283 "
"different patents forbids some computational process found somewhere in the "
"thousands of pages of source code of Linux.  At the time, Linux was around "
"one percent of the whole GNU/Linux system.  How many patents might there be "
"that a distributor of the whole system could be sued under?"

"The way to prevent software patents from bollixing software development is "
"simple: don't authorize them.  This ought to be easy, since most patent laws "
"have provisions against software patents.  They typically say that "
"&ldquo;software per se&rdquo; cannot be patented.  But patent offices around "
"the world are trying to twist the words and issuing patents on the ideas "
"implemented in programs.  Unless this is blocked, the result will be to put "
"all software developers in danger."
