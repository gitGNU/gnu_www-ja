"There are a number of reasons why I'm not a communist. The first of them is "
"that I'm not against the idea of private business, as long as it does not "
"oppose people's human rights and the interests of society. Business is "

"With these 4 Freedoms, you can live an upright life with your community.  If "
"you use nonfree, proprietary software, the developer has the power to decide "
"what you can do. He can use that power over you. Like Microsoft. That game "
"is evil. Nobody should play it. So it's not a question of beating Microsoft "
"at its game. I set out to get away from that game."

"Once GNU-Linux was ready in 1992, it began to catch on. It was reliable, "
"powerful, cheap and flexible. Thousands and millions of people began to use "
"GNU-Linux. But the ideals of freedom began to be forgotten though. In 1998, "
"people stopped talking about Free Software. Instead they said &ldquo;open "
"source&rdquo;. That was a way of not saying &ldquo;free&rdquo; and not "
"mentioning the ideas behind it. I don't disagree with that, but that's not "
"what I am interested in. What I'm really interested in most of all is to "
"teach people to value their freedoms and to fight for them. In software, as "
"in the US, our freedom is threatened. So the basic things we need to do are: "
"remember our freedom frequently, value it and insist on it. When someone "
"says they protect me from terrorism by taking away my freedom&mdash;say No! "
"Similarly, with software that threatens our freedom, that might give us some "
"temporary comparative advantage&mdash;we should say No!"

"West Bengal should not follow the world trend. It should stand up for "
"freedom. That's different. No! I'm not going to let the world lead me where "
"it wants to go. I'm going where freedom is. If you're going "
"elsewhere&mdash;I'm not going there. It requires firmness, it requires a "
"decision that says freedom matters and hence it must be promoted.  Even if "
"that's inconvenient. Freedom needs some sacrifices, some inconvenience, some "
"price. But it's a small price to pay."

"By globalisation, people usually mean globalisation of the power of "
"business. Business should not have political power. Otherwise democracy "
"becomes sick. And with globalisation of business power, this political power "
"is enhanced. Free trade treaties are designed to attack democracy. For "
"instance, it explicitly allows any business to sue government if a law makes "
"its profit less than it has been.  Companies have to be paid for the "
"permission to do anything of social or environmental importance. Not all "
"free trade treaties do this explicitly. They do it implicitly. Companies can "
"threaten to move away elsewhere. And they do use this threat."

"This actually happened some years ago, with the EU software patents. The "
"govt of Denmark was threatened that if they did not support this the company "
"would move the business elsewhere. This tiny threat was sufficient to "
"blackmail the govt of Denmark. If you allow a foreign mega-corporation to "
"buy a domestic corporation, you are allowing it to buy a weapon pointed "
"against your country. The environment, public health, general standards of "
"living&mdash;are all important, and free trade treaties should be "
"abolished. They are harmful to freedom, health and the lives of people."

"I do not accept the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;. The very term "
"is biased and confusing. It talks about useful techniques and works. It "
"presumes they are &ldquo;property&rdquo;. It prejudges such "
"questions. There's also a more subtle problem. It lumps together all the "
"diverse things and makes it look like you can talk about all of them "
"together. Copyright, patents, trade laws&mdash;are all very different. It "
"takes the geatest efforts of the best scholars to overcome the confusion "
"caused by the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and to discuss the "
"details of these individual items."

"Impediments to Education and Science. Free trade and enhancement of world "
"trade harms democracy. When you globalise something evil, it becomes a "
"greater evil. And when you globalise something good, it becomes a greater "
"good. Human knowledge and cooperation are such &ldquo;goods&rdquo;. The Free "
"Software Movement is a part of that. It is the globalisation of one area of "
"human knowledge, namely software. Through global cooperation like this, you "
"get freedom and independence for every region and every country."

"Proprietary software is a colonial system. It's electronic colonialism. And "
"not by a country, but by a corporation. Electronic colonial powers keep "
"people divided and helpless. Look at the end-user licensing agreement. You "
"don't have the source code, you are helpless. You can't share, and so you "
"are kept divided. National colonial powers recruit local elites and pay them "
"and keep them above the rest of the people, working for the colonial "
"masters. Today we see electronic colonial powers recruit native zamindars to "
"keep the system intact. Microsoft sets up a research facility and in "
"exchange it keeps its grip firmly on everyone else. Govts and schools are in "
"their grip. They know how to do this. They know how to buy govt support. But "
"what's the govt buying? Dependency, not development. Only Free Software "
"constitutes development. It enables any activity to be fully under the "
"control of the people doing it. Free Software is appropriate "
"technology. Proprietary software is not appropriate for any use."

"The West Bengal govt has an opportunity to adopt a policy of firm leadership "
"in this regard. This will give a boost to human resource development. Free "
"Software respects people's freedom. Govt has an influence on the future of "
"society. Choosing which software to teach students: if you teach them "
"Windows, they will be Windows users. For something else, they need to learn, "
"and make the effort to learn something else. Microsoft knows this. So it "
"donates Windows to schools. Addiction (through using unauthorised software "
"use) only helps them. They didn't want to leave anything to choice, so they "
"give Windows free to schools. Like injecting a dose. The first dose is "
"gratis. Afterwards it's not gratis, either for them or their employers. This "
"is a way to impose their power on the rest of society and its "
"future. Schools have a mission to society. This mission requires teaching "
"students to live in freedom, teaching skills to make it easy to live in "
"freedom. This means using Free Software."

"Free Software is good for computer science education, to maximise the "
"potential of natural programmers. It gives students the opportunity to "
"really learn. It's good for the natural programmers. If you have proprietary "
"software, the teacher says &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo;, &ldquo;You are not "
"allowed to know, it's a secret.&rdquo; So the alternative is to give him the "
"source codes and let him read it all. They will then learn to be really good "

"But the most crucial reason is for the sake of moral education. Teaching "
"them to be good corporations and benevolent, helpful citizens. This has to "
"be taught. School has to teach by example. If you bring software to class, "
"you must share this with other kids. Or don't bring it. Schools must follow "
"their own rule, by bringing Free Software to class.  Schools should use 100% "
"Free Software. No proprietary software should be used in schools. Public "
"agencies, after a migration period, should use Free Software. All software "
"development must run on Free Software platforms. And if it's released to the "
"public, it must be Free Software. (Free: as in free speech, not free beer.)"

"One easy and useful way to put Free Software in schools&mdash;is to "

"making lots of laws to make multinational corporations happy. Maybe this was "
