<h2>Proprietary Jails</h2>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary systems that are
<em>jails</em>&mdash;they do not allow the user to freely
install applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-think-yo.html">
iOS, the operating system of the Apple iThings, is a jail.</a>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/301057/microsoft-metro-app-store-lockdown">
Windows 8 on &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; is a jail.</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Game consoles are jails, too: no game can run on the console unless
the console's manufacturer has authorized it.  Alas, I can't find a
article to cite as a reference for this fact.  Please inform us if you
know of one.

     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
