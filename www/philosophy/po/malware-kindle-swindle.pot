"Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  Malware means the "
"program is designed to mistreat or harm users when it runs.  The difference "
"between <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a> and nonfree "
"software is in <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html\"> whether the "
"users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's not directly a "
"question of what the program <em>does</em> when it runs.  However, in "
"practice nonfree software is often malware, because the developer's "
"awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any malicious "
"functionalities tempts the developer to impose some."

"Amazon Kindle has DRM</a>. That article is flawed in that it fails to treat "
"DRM as an ethical question; it takes for granted that whatever Amazon might "
"do to its users is legitimate. It refers to DRM as digital "
"&ldquo;rights&rdquo; management, which is the spin term used to promote "
"DRM. Nonetheless it serves as a reference for the facts."
