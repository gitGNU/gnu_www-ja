"<em>Note:</em> This applies to the earlier license used for Plan 9.  The "
"current license of Plan 9 does qualify as free software (and also as open "
"source).  So this article's specific example is of historical relevance "
"only.  Nonetheless, the general point remains valid."

"When I saw the announcement that the Plan 9 software had been released as "
"&ldquo;open source&rdquo;, I wondered whether it might be free software as "
"well.  After studying the license, my conclusion was that it is not free; "
"the license contains several restrictions that are totally unacceptable for "
"the Free Software Movement.  (See <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)"

"I am not a supporter of the Open Source Movement, but I was glad when one of "
"their leaders told me they don't consider the license acceptable either.  "
"When the developers of Plan 9 describe it as &ldquo;open source&rdquo;, they "
"are altering the meaning of that term and thus spreading confusion.  (The "
"term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; is widely misunderstood; see <a "

"This seemed reasonable to me at first glance, but later I realized that it "
