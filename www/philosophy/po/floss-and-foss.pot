"The two political camps in the free software community are the free software "
"movement and open source.  The free software movement is a campaign for <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html\"> computer users' "
"freedom</a>; we say that a nonfree program is an injustice to its users.  "
"The open source camp declines to see the issue as a matter of justice to the "
"users, and bases its arguments on <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html\"> practical benefits "
"only</a>."

"To emphasize that &ldquo;free software&rdquo; refers to freedom and not to "
"price, we sometimes write or say &ldquo;free/libre software,&rdquo; adding "
"the French or Spanish word that means free in the sense of freedom.  In some "
"contexts, it works to use just &ldquo;libre software.&rdquo;"

"A researcher studying practices and methods used by developers in the free "
"software community decided that these questions were independent of the "
"developers' political views, so he used the term &ldquo;FLOSS,&rdquo; "
"meaning &ldquo;Free/Libre and Open Source Software,&rdquo; to explicitly "
"avoid a preference between the two political camps.  If you wish to be "
"neutral, this is a good way to do it, since this makes the names of the two "
"camps equally prominent."

"Others use the term &ldquo;FOSS,&rdquo; which stands for &ldquo;Free and "
"Open Source Software.&rdquo; This is meant to mean the same thing as "
"&ldquo;FLOSS,&rdquo; but it is less clear, since it fails to explain that "
"&ldquo;free&rdquo; refers to <em>freedom</em>.  It also makes &ldquo;free "
"software&rdquo; less visible than &ldquo;open source,&rdquo; since it "
"presents &ldquo;open source&rdquo; prominently but splits &ldquo;free "
"software&rdquo; apart."

"Thus, if you want to be neutral between free software and open source, the "

"We in the free software movement don't do use either of these terms, because "
"we don't want to be neutral on the political question.  We stand for "
"freedom, and we show it every time&mdash;by saying &ldquo;free&rdquo; and "
"&ldquo;libre&rdquo;."
