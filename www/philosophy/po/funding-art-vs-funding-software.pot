"I've proposed two new systems to fund artists in a world where we have "
"legalized sharing (noncommercial redistribution of exact copies) of "
"published works.  One is for the state to collect taxes for the purpose, and "
"divide the money among artists in proportion to the cube root of the "
"popularity of each one (as measured by surveying samples of the "
"population).  The other is for each player to have a &ldquo;donate&rdquo; "
"button to anonymously send a small sum (perhaps 50 cents, in the US) to the "
"artists who made the last work played.  These funds would go to artists, not "
"to their publishers."

"People often wonder why I don't propose these methods for free software.  "

"In my view, works designed to be used to do practical jobs must be free.  "
"The people who use them deserve to have control over the jobs they do, which "
"requires control over the works they use to do them, which requires the four "
"freedoms (see <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\"> "
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>).  Works to do practical jobs "
"include educational resources, reference works, recipes, text fonts and, of "
"course, software; these works must be free."

"That argument does not apply to works of opinion (such as this one) or art, "
"because they are not designed for the users to do practical jobs with.  "
"Thus, I don't believe those works must be free.  We must legalize sharing "
"them, and using pieces in remix to make totally different new works, but "
"that doesn't include in publishing modified versions of them.  It follows "
"that, for these works, we can tell who the authors are.  Each published work "
"can specify who its authors are, and changing that information can be "
"illegal."

"That crucial point enables my proposed funding systems to work.  It means "
"that if you play a song and push the &ldquo;donate&rdquo; button, the system "
"can be sure who should get your donation.  Likewise, if you participate in "
"the survey that calculates popularities, the system will know who to credit "
"with a little more popularity because you listened to that song or made a "
"copy of it."

"When one song is made by multiple artists (for instance, several musicians "
"and a songwriter), that doesn't happen by accident.  They know they are "
"working together, and they can decide in advance how to divide up the "
"popularity that song later develops&mdash;or use the standard default rules "
"for this division.  This case creates no problem for those two funding "
"proposals because the work, once made, is not changed by others."

"However, in a field of free works, one large work can have hundreds, even "
"thousands of authors.  There can be various versions with different, "
"overlapping sets of authors.  Moreover, the contributions of those authors "
"will differ in kind as well as in magnitude.  This makes it impossible to "
"divide the work's popularity among the contributors in a way that can be "
"justified as correct.  It's not just hard work; it's not merely complex.  "
"The problem raises philosophical questions that have no good answers."

"Consider, for example, the free program GNU Emacs.  Our records of "
"contributions to the code of GNU Emacs are incomplete in the period before "
"we started using version control&mdash;before that we have only the change "
"logs.  But let's imagine we still had every version and could determine "
"precisely what code contribution is due to each of the hundreds of "
"contributors.  We'd still be stuck."

"If we wanted to give credit in proportion to lines of code (or should it be "
"characters?), then it would be straightforward, once we decide how to handle "
"a line that was written by A and then changed by B.  But that assumes each "
"line as important as every other line.  I am sure that is wrong&mdash;some "
"pieces of the code do more important jobs and others less; some code is "
"harder to write and other code is easier.  But I see no way to quantify "
"these distinctions, and the developers could argue about them forever.  I "
"might deserve some additional credit for having initially written the "
"program, and certain others might deserve additional credit for having "
"initially written certain later important additions, but I see no objective "
"way to decide how much.  I can't propose a justifiable rule for dividing up "
"the popularity credit of a program like GNU Emacs."

"As for asking all the contributors to negotiate an agreement, we can't even "
"try.  There have been hundreds of contributors, and we could not find them "
"all today.  They contributed across a span of 26 years, and never at any "
"time did all those people decide to work together."

"We might not even know the names of all the authors.  If some code was "

"Then what about the forked or modified variants of GNU Emacs? Each one is an "
"additional case, equally complex but different.  How much of the credit for "
"such a variant should go to those who worked on that variant, and how much "
"to the original authors of the code they got from other GNU Emacs versions, "
"other programs, and so on?"

"The conclusion is that there is no way we could come up with a division of "
"the credit for GNU Emacs and justify it as anything but arbitrary.  But "
"Emacs is not a special case; it is a typical example.  The same problems "
"would arise for many important free programs, and other free works such as "
"Wikipedia pages."
