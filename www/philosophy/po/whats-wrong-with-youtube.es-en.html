<h2>What's Wrong with YouTube</h2>

<p>Please
cite <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org/">audio-video.gnu.org</a> as
the site for videos of my speeches &mdash; not YouTube.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why YouTube is a bad choice for where to post
videos or refer to videos.</p>

<ul>
<li>Normal use of YouTube involves use of nonfree software.

  <ul>
   <li>In the default (non-HTML5) mode, it involves use of Flash Player.
   It even tells users to install Flash Player.</li>

   <li>In the HTML5 mode, it involves use of running a nonfree JavaScript
   program.

   <p>There are ways to access YouTube without running that nonfree
   software. Users who are in the know can avoid that problem. For
   instance, you can access the non-HTML5 videos with 
   <a href="http://gnashdev.org/">Gnash</a>, and you can get any of them with 
   <a href="http://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a>.</p>

   <p>However, most users don't use these methods, so putting a video
   on YouTube directs them towards nonfree software.  To avoid that,
   post the video as an Ogg or Webm file on an ordinary web site.</p></li>
   </ul>
</li>

<li>YouTube tries to stop people from downloading copies.

    <p>There are ways to download from YouTube, such as youtube-dl, but the
    <em>attempt</em> to stop people from downloading a file is morally wrong 
    even if it can be defeated.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing about YouTube that is <em>not</em> a moral strike against it
is nonfree software on YouTube servers &mdash; if there is any.
We as outsiders can't tell, because it wouldn't affect us, which is
why it is not an injustice towards us.</p>

<p>If there are any nonfree programs running on YouTube servers, they
mistreat Google by denying Google control of that part of its
computing. We hope that Google will reclaim its freedom by ceasing to
use those nonfree programs, if there are any. But they do not
mistreat the <em>users</em> of that service, so they are not a reason to
refuse to <em>use</em> YouTube.</p>

<p>A way to publish videos to the web using free software is
<a href="http://mediagoblin.org/">GNU MediaGoblin</a>.  Ideally
you will set up
<a href="http://docs.mediagoblin.org/">your own server</a>, or run
one for your family and friends, but you can also post on
<a href="https://wiki.mediagoblin.org/Live_instances">public
servers</a>.</p>

GNU MediaGoblin</a> if you can.</p>
