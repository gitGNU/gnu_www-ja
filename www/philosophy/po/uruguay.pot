"A bill now under consideration in Uruguay showed the Free Software "
"Foundation an important point that was missing in our list of recommended "
"government policies to promote free software.  The bill says that when the "
"state develops or contracts for development of software, this software must "
"be developable in a 100%-free-software environment."

"This requirement avoids problems that can really happen. Even if the source "
"code of the solution is delivered as free software, and can run on a "
"100%-free-software GNU/Linux system, it could be trapped in other ways."

"For example, compiling its source code could require a nonfree program.  "
"Even editing its source code could require a nonfree program. Both of these "
"problems can occur when a nonfree IDE is used, and this would create "
"additional obstacles to migrating the state to free software.  It is wise "
"and proper for the law to reject these methods of developing computing "
"solutions for the state."

"Taking this into consideration, the FSF has updated its recommendations for "
