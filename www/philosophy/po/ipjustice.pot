"The FSF also opposes this directive, but we did not sign that statement "
"because it accepts too much of what ought to be opposed.  EU law is already "
"too restrictive, and simply to prevent further changes is not enough.  It is "
"wrong to stop people from sharing music and other published works, and only "
"draconian laws could possibly do the job, so it's no surprise to see they "
"are being proposed.  But opposing this directive without criticizing its "
"unjust motivation is insufficient.  Even using the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo; is a point of weakness, because this is a <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty\"> propaganda "
"term</a> for those who aim to restrict the public."
