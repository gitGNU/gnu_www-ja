"copyleft: /kop'ee-left/ [play on &lsquo;copyright&rsquo;] n. 1. The "

"and other Free Software Foundation software, granting reuse and reproduction "

"The idea of <a href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">copyleft</a> originated with "
"&uuml;ber-hacker <a href=\"http://www.stallman.org/\"> Richard Stallman</a> "
"in 1983 when he started the <a href=\"/gnu/gnu-history.html\">GNU "
"Project</a>. In brief, his goal was &ldquo;to develop a complete free "
"Unix-like operating system.&rdquo; As part of that goal, he invented and "
"wrote the <a href=\"/copyleft/gpl.html\">GNU General Public License</a>, a "
"legal construct that included a copyright notice but added to it (or, "
"technically, removed certain restrictions), so its terms allowed for the "
"freedoms of reuse, modification and reproduction of a work or its "
"derivatives to be kept for all."

"Normal <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/planet/carroll/\"> copyright</a> "
"asserts ownership and identification of the author, as well as prevents the "
"use of the author's name as author of a distorted version of the work; it "
"also prevents intentional distortion of the work by others and prevents "
"destruction of the work. But it also carries other restrictions &mdash; such "
"as restricting the reproduction or modification of a work."

"Copyleft contains the normal copyright statement, asserting ownership and "
"identification of the author. However, it then <em>gives away</em> some of "
"the other rights implicit in the normal copyright: it says that not only are "
"you free to redistribute this work, but you are also free to change the "
"work. However, you cannot claim to have written the original work, nor can "
"you claim that these changes were created by someone else. Finally, all "
"derivative works must also be placed under these terms."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Certain restrictions of copyright &mdash; such as distribution and "
"modification &mdash; are not very useful to &ldquo;cyberia,&rdquo; the "
"&ldquo;free, apolitical, democratic community&rdquo; that constitutes the "
"internetworked digital world."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"With computers, perfect copies of a digital work can easily be made &mdash; "
"and even modified, or further distributed &mdash; by others, with no loss of "
"the original work. As individuals interact in cyberia, sharing information "
"&mdash; then reacting and building upon it &mdash; is not only natural, but "
"this is the <em>only</em> way for individual beings to thrive in a "
"community. In essence, the idea of copyleft is basic to the natural "
"propagation of digital information among humans in a society. This is why "
"the regular notion of copyright does not make sense in the context of "
"cyberia."

"Simple &lsquo;public domain&rsquo; publication will not work, because some "
"will try to abuse this for profit by depriving others of freedom; as long as "
"we live in a world with a legal system where legal abstractions such as "
"copyright are necessary, as responsible artists or scientists we will need "
"the formal legal abstractions of copyleft that ensure our freedom and the "
"freedom of others."

"It <em>is</em> good enough! The GNU GPL is not only a document of "
"significant historical and literary value, but it is in wide use today for "
"countless software programs &mdash; those as formal part of the GNU Project "
"and otherwise. The GNU GPL originated for the specific goal of sharing "
"software among computer programmers. However, looking closely at the GPL, it "
"appears that the same License can be easily applied to non-software "
"information."

"Alternately, a document can be copylefted under different, or much simpler "

"It's simple. While a particular situation may require or inspire its own "
"specific License, possibly similar to the GNU GPL, all that a copyleft "
"notice must really do is fulfill the points as defined above in &ldquo;<a "

"copyleft your work is easy."

"The GNU GPL states that it &ldquo;applies to any program or other work which "
"contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be "
"distributed under the terms of this General Public License,&rdquo; so this "
"&ldquo;Program,&rdquo; then, may not necessarily be a computer software "
"program &mdash; any work of any nature that can be copyrighted can be "
"copylefted with the GNU GPL."

"The GNU GPL references the &ldquo;source code&rdquo; of a work; this "
"&ldquo;source code&rdquo; will mean different things for different kinds of "
"information, but the definition of &ldquo;source code&rdquo; &mdash; "
