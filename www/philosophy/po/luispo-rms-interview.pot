"Richard M. Stallman is the most forceful and famous practitioner/theorist of "
"<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/tech/fsp/glossary/index.html\">free "
"software</a>, a termed he coined. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; here means free as in "
"&ldquo;free speech,&rdquo; not free as in &ldquo;free beer.&rdquo; "
"Stallman's most famous intervention in the &ldquo;free software&rdquo; "
"movement has surely been the GNU General Public License (<a "
"href=\"/philosophy/license-list.html\">GPL</a>), which Stallman created "
"around 1985 as a general license that could be applied to any program. The "
"license codifies the concept of &ldquo;<a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html\">copyleft</a>,&rdquo; the "
"&ldquo;central idea&rdquo; of which Stallman has described as giving "
"&ldquo;everyone permission to run the program, copy the program, modify the "
"program, and distribute modified versions, but not permission to add "
"restrictions of their own. Thus, the crucial freedoms that define "
"&lsquo;free software&rsquo; are guaranteed to everyone who has a copy; they "
"become inalienable rights&rdquo; (Stallman, &ldquo;The GNU Operating System "
"and the Free Software Movement,&rdquo; in DiBona, <cite>Open Sources: Voices "
"from the Open Source Revolution</cite>)"

"Every free-software license since probably owes its existence to Stallman's "
"vision, including those licenses by which OpenOffice.org code is "
"governed. Stallman's work is of course resolutely practical. A short list of "
"his coding accomplishments would include Emacs as well as most of the "
"components of the GNU/Linux system, which he either wrote or helped "
"write. In 1990, Stallman received a <a "
"href=\"http://www.macfound.org/programs/fel/fel_overview.htm\">McArthur "
"Foundation</a> fellowship; he has used the funds given him to further his "
"free software work. (See Moody, <cite>Rebel Code</cite> for a good account "
"of Stallman's mission.)"

"The opportunity for this interview arose when I saw Stallman lecture at "
"Sun's Cupertino campus in May. At that time, I requested an email interview "
"with Stallman. He assented, and shortly after, I submitted the series of "
"questions below, to which he responded, often at length.  However, my "
"efforts for a follow-up failed, so this interview is only the first pass. As "
"a consequence, I was unable to extend (and challenge) some interesting "
"avenues; I have also provided as much context as possible for Stallman's "
"politics in the links. It goes without saying that Stallman's views are his "
"own and do not necessarily represent mine or those of OpenOffice.org."

"This takes us to a point that is quite important and that I am hoping you "
"can clarify for our readers. The term you prefer for your ethic is "
"&ldquo;free software,&rdquo; where the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; means freedom "
"from constraints and not free to take. But the term that more and more "
"people are using is &ldquo;Open Source,&rdquo; a term of quite recent "
"vintage (1998), and, from your perspective, filled with significant "
"problems. Of the two, free software is a term that implies an ethic of "
"living and holds out the promise of a more just society; the other, "
"&ldquo;open source,&rdquo; does not."

"The <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org\">open source movement</a> focuses "
"on convincing business that it can profit by respecting the users' freedom "

"software movement</a> appreciate those efforts, but we believe that there is "
"a more important issue at stake: all programmers [owe] an ethical obligation "
"to respect those freedoms for other people. Profit is not wrong in itself, "
"but it can't justify mistreating other people."

"Along these lines, there has been considerable confusion over how to name "

"Anyone who criticizes certain business practices can expect to be called "

"Pekka Himanen, in his recent work, the <cite>Hacker Ethic</cite>, has "
