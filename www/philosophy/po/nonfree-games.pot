"A well known company, Valve, that distributes nonfree computer games with "

"I suppose that availability of popular nonfree programs on GNU/Linux can "
"boost adoption of the system.  However, our goal goes beyond making this "
"system a &ldquo;success&rdquo;; its purpose is to bring freedom to the "
"users.  Thus, the question is how this development affects users' freedom."

"The problem with these games is not that <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Commercial\"> they are "
"commercial</a>.  (We see nothing wrong with that.)  It is not that <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/selling.html\"> the developers sell copies</a>; that's "
"not wrong either.  The problem is that the games contain software that is <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">not free</a> (free in the sense of "
"freedom, of course)."

"Nonfree game programs (like other nonfree programs) are unethical because "
"they deny freedom to their users.  (Game art is a different issue, because "
"it isn't software.)  If you want freedom, one requisite for it is not having "
"or running nonfree programs on your computer.  That much is clear."

"However, if you're going to use these games, you're better off using them on "
"GNU/Linux rather than on Microsoft Windows.  At least you avoid <a "

"Thus, in direct practical terms, this development can do both harm and "
"good.  It might encourage GNU/Linux users to install these games, and it "
"might encourage users of the games to replace Windows with GNU/Linux.  My "
"guess is that the direct good effect will be bigger than the direct harm.  "
"But there is also an indirect effect: what does the use of these games teach "
"people in our community?"

"Any GNU/Linux distro that comes with software to offer these games will "
"teach users that the point is not freedom.  <a "
"href=\"/distros/common-distros.html\">Nonfree software in GNU/Linux "
"distros</a> already works against the goal of freedom.  Adding these games "
"to a distro would augment that effect."

"Free software is a matter of freedom, not price.  A free game need not be "
"gratis.  It is feasible to develop free games commercially, while respecting "
"your freedom to change the software you use.  Since the art in the game is "
"not software, it does not need to be free.  There is in fact free game "
"software developed by companies, as well as free games developed "
"noncommercially by volunteers.  Crowdfunding development will only get "
"easier."

"But if we suppose that it is <em>impossible</em> to develop some kind of "
"free game &mdash; what would follow then? There's no good in writing it as a "
"nonfree game.  To have freedom in your computing, rejecting nonfree software "
"is necessary, pure and simple.  Therefore, you as a freedom-lover won't use "
"the nonfree game if it exists, so you won't lose anything if it does not "
"exist."
