"A well known company, Valve, that distributes nonfree computer games with "

"I suppose that availability of popular nonfree programs on GNU/Linux can "
"boost adoption of the system.  However, our goal goes beyond making this "
"system a &ldquo;success&rdquo;; its purpose is to bring freedom to the "
"users.  Thus, the question is how this development affects users' freedom."

"Nonfree games (like other nonfree programs) are unethical because they deny "
"freedom to their users.  If you want freedom, one requisite for it is not "
"having these games on your computer.  That much is clear."

"However, if you're going to use these games, you're better off using them on "
"GNU/Linux rather than on Microsoft Windows.  At least you avoid <a "

"would do</a>."

"Thus, in direct practical terms, this development can do both harm and "
"good.  It might encourage GNU/Linux users to install these games, and it "
"might encourage users of the games to replace Windows with GNU/Linux.  My "
"guess is that the direct good effect will be bigger than the direct harm.  "
"But there is also an indirect effect: what does the use of these games teach "
"people in our community?"

"Any GNU/Linux distro that comes with software to offer these games will "
"teach users that the point is not freedom.  <a "
"href=\"/distros/common-distros.html\">Nonfree software in GNU/Linux "
"distros</a> already works against the goal of freedom.  Adding these games "
"to a distro would augment that effect."

"If you want to promote freedom, please take care not to talk about the "
"availability of these games on GNU/Linux as support for our cause.  Instead "
"you could tell people about the <a href=\"http://lpc.opengameart.org/\"> "
"Liberated Pixel Cup</a> free game contest and the <a "
