<h2>FSF's Position on W3 Consortium &ldquo;Royalty-Free&rdquo; Patent Policy</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
<i>Rewritten 1 June 2003</i>
</p>

<h3>Our Position</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation, represented by Professor Moglen of
Columbia University Law School, has participated in the W3 Consortium
Patent Policy Working Group from November 2001 through the present.
The current W3C patent policy, which in most cases requires
&ldquo;royalty-free&rdquo; or &ldquo;RF&rdquo; patent licenses, is a
significant step in the direction of protecting the World Wide Web
from patent-encumbered standards.  But it falls short because a
loophole allows conditions on these patent licenses that would
prohibit free software implementations of the standards.</p>

<p>
The problem comes from the &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions
that patent holders are allowed to put in their royalty-free patent
licenses.  Such restrictions say that you are allowed to practice the
patented idea, but only for implementing the standard precisely as
specified &mdash; not in any other way.  Thus, if you change the code
to depart from the spec even slightly, the patent license no longer
protects you from against being sued for infringing the patent.</p>

<p>
One requirement for Free Software is that users have the freedom to
modify and redistribute it.  But we can hardly consider that users
have freedom to publish modified versions of the program if, for a
part of the program's behavior, modification is prohibited.  Thus,
these &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions would prevent
implementation of W3C standards as <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">
Free Software</a>.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Field of use&rdquo; restrictions are also legally incompatible
with section 7 of the <a href="/licenses/gpl.html#TOC3">GNU General
Public License</a>, since it does not allow the user's freedom to
modify to be shrunk to zero in this way.</p>

<p>
Many other Free Software licenses have no provisions equivalent to the
GPL's Section 7, but you can't solve the problem merely by using one
of those licenses.  Section 7 is intended to prevent the imposition of
side restrictions (for instance, by patent licenses) which would deny
the freedoms that the GPL itself gives you.  If the software license
does nothing to prevent this, you can find yourself in a situation
where the program's license appears to give you freedom, but this
freedom has been taken away by restrictions not stated there.</p>

<p>
For example, suppose the W3 obtains patent licenses for a standard
describing certain functionality in a web server.  One of the things
you should be able to do with a Free Software implementation of that
standard is to merge it into a web browser or a non-interactive web
client, so as to provide the same functionality there.  However, in
this new context, the code would not be implementing the specific
standard for which the patent was licensed, so the restriction that
the patent is licensed only &ldquo;in order to implement the
standard&rdquo; would not be met.  Even reusing the exact same code in
the new context would face possible claims of patent infringement.</p>

<p>
Freedom to modify software can always be limited by third-party
patents in ways that the software copyright license doesn't disclose.
This is why software patents are <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">so
dangerous to software freedom</a>.  The W3C, by allowing members of
W3C working groups that help to frame standards to impose restrictions
on the modifiability of code that implements those standards, is
missing an opportunity to help solve that problem, and may in specific
cases even be helping to make the problem worse.</p>

<p>
By allowing &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions, the proposed
policy falls short of protecting the rights of the Free Software
community to fully participate in the implementation and extension of
web standards.  The goal of our participation in the policy making
process at W3C, to make sure web standards can be implemented in free
software, has only been partially achieved.</p>

<p>The FSF plans to continue to participate in the implementation
process.  We will try to convince patent-holders not to impose
&ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions, and we encourage all those
who care about the right of Free Software developers to implement all
future web standards to do the same.</p>

<h3>Interaction with the GPL</h3>

<p>
The problem of &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions comes
from <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20030520.html#sec-Requirements">
Section 3 of the W3C's proposed patent policy</a>.  Item 3 of that
section says that the royalty-free license &ldquo;may be limited to
implementations of the Recommendation, and to what is required by the
Recommendation&rdquo;.  Here's how such &ldquo;field of use&rdquo;
restrictions interact with the GNU GPL.
</p>

<p>
The problem is the interaction of such a &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction with
<a href="/licenses/gpl.html#TOC3">Section 7 of GPL</a>.  Under Section
7, the &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction is a &ldquo;conditions
are imposed on you [the distributor of GPL'ed software] that
contradict the conditions of this License&rdquo;.  The
&ldquo;conditions of this license&rdquo; require, for example, that
those receiving distributions of GPL'ed software have the right to run
the program for any purpose (Section 0), the right to modify it for
any purpose (Section 2), etc.  Any of these &ldquo;purposes&rdquo;
could easily practice the teachings of the patent beyond what the
&ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction allows.
</p>
<p>
Here's a detailed step-by-step example that shows how this problem could
play out:</p>

<ol>
<li>
  Programmer <em>P</em> downloads the Konqueror web browser, receiving it
  under terms of GPL.</li>

<li><em>P</em> learns of a new web standard that requires exercising a
  technique for parsing URLs that is patented by Corporation <em>C</em>.
  <em>C</em> has licensed the patent under an RF, non-exclusive
  license, but with a &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction that says
  the license can be used to &ldquo;implement the standard&rdquo;.
  The standard, as it turns out, covers only what browsers must do
  with URLs, and says nothing about the server side or clients that
  aren't user browsers.</li>

<li><em>P</em> implements this technique in Konqueror, and seeks to
  redistribute the modified version on his website so that other users
  can benefit from Konqueror now complying with the standard.  If he
  does, he is bound by the GPL under copyright law, because he is
  redistributing a modified version.</li>

<li>However, he knows full well of a condition on that code that
   contradicts the GPL (violating Section 7) &mdash; namely, he knows
   that <em>C</em>'s patent license prohibits folks from taking his
   URL parsing code and putting it into, say, a search engine.
   Therefore, under GPL Section 7, he is prohibited from
   redistribution.</li>

<li>You might think that <em>P</em> can simply assign his copyright to
  the existing copyright holder of Konqueror and let distribution
  happen from that source.  They could distribute under the GPL, but
  they would be granting a self-contradicting license.  Nothing
  prohibits someone from distributing copyrighted works under licenses
  that make no sense and are self-contradictory, but that is not free
  software.  Those who receive distribution of those works are stuck,
  and can't undertake further distribution or modification
  themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Regardless of who makes the changes, the result either shuts down
distribution or forces the original developer to abandon the GPL (and
the program won't really be free even though its license looks free).
Both outcomes are very unfortunate.  This is why we urge the community
to pressure patentholders not to use &ldquo;field of use&rdquo;
restrictions.
