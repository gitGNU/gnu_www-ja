"I'm sorry, but I was unable to read the Microsoft Word document you sent "
"me. Microsoft has been steadily changing the .doc format over the releases "
"of Microsoft Word (4.0, 95, 97, 2000, and now XP). Microsoft has also "
"intentionally refused to release the specification of the .doc format to the "
"community, making Microsoft Word the only application that can reliably open "
"this format. There is the Microsoft Word Viewer application, but it only "
"runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems and does not allow one to edit "
"the document."

"The development team that designed the software I choose to use "
"(OpenOffice.org), has tried hard to figure out how the .doc format is "
"created and interpreted, in order to make it available to more people.  They "
"believe that all people should be able to exchange information "
"electronically, and .doc is one of the most common formats. So, they tried "
"to make OpenOffice.org, the main competitor to Microsoft's own Office suite, "
"as compatible as possible with Microsoft's own formats.  But Microsoft did "
"not like this, because it would mean that people that have not bought "
"Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office would be able to read and write .doc "
"documents."

"Unfortunately, it seems that Microsoft is sometimes successful. My "

"PPS: When I tried to open the document you sent to me, my word processor "
"crashed, obviously unable to properly interpret the .doc format. My word "
"processor was handling 4 other documents at the time. Two of them were "
"assignments, and all changes I had not saved were lost. On aggregate, about "
"two hours of my work were lost because the OpenOffice.org developers were "
"unable to overcome the barriers Microsoft put in place, and render the "
"document properly. I believe they are the last to blame for this failure."
