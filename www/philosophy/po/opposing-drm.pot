"In 1989, in a very different world, I wrote the first version of the GNU "
"General Public License, a license that gives computer users freedom. The GNU "
"GPL, of all the free software licenses, is the one that most fully embodies "
"the values and aims of the free software movement, by ensuring the four "
"fundamental freedoms for every user. These are freedoms to 0)  run the "
"program as you wish; 1) study the source code and change it to do what you "
"wish; 2) make and distribute copies, when you wish; 3) and distribute "
"modified versions, when you wish."

"Any license that grants these freedoms is a free software license. The GNU "
"GPL goes further: it protects these freedoms for all users of all versions "
"of the program by forbidding middlemen from stripping them off.  Most "
"components of the GNU/Linux operating system, including the Linux component "
"that was made free software in 1992, are licensed under GPL version 2, "
"released in 1991. Now, with legal advice from Professor Eben Moglen, I am "
"designing version 3 of the GNU GPL."

"GPLv3 must cope with threats to freedom that we did not imagine in 1989.  "
"The coming generation of computers, and many products with increasingly "
"powerful embedded computers, are being turned against us by their "
"manufacturers before we buy them&mdash;they are designed to restrict what we "
"can use them to do."

"First, there was the TiVo. People may think of it as an appliance to record "
"TV programs, but it contains a real computer running a GNU/Linux system. As "
"required by the GPL, you can get the source code for the system. You can "
"change the code, recompile and install it. But once you install a changed "
"version, the TiVo won't run at all, because of a special mechanism designed "
"to sabotage you. Freedom No. 1, the freedom to change the software to do "
"what you wish, has become a sham."

"Then came Treacherous Computing, promoted as &ldquo;Trusted "
"Computing,&rdquo; meaning that companies can &ldquo;trust&rdquo; your "
"computer to obey them instead of you. It enables network sites to tell which "
"program you are running; if you change the program, or write your own, they "
"will refuse to talk to you. Once again, freedom No. 1 becomes a sham."

"Microsoft has a scheme, originally called Palladium, that enables an "
"application program to &ldquo;seal&rdquo; data so that no other program can "
"access it. If Disney distributes movies this way, you'll be unable to "
"exercise your legal rights of fair use and de minimis use. If an application "
"records your data this way, it will be the ultimate in vendor lock-in. This "
"too destroys freedom No. 1 &mdash; if modified versions of a program cannot "
"access the same data, you can't really change the program to do what you "
"wish. Something like Palladium is planned for a coming version of Windows."

"AACS, the &ldquo;Advanced Access Content System,&rdquo; promoted by Disney, "
"IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and others, aims to restrict use of HDTV "
"recordings&mdash;and software&mdash;so they can't be used except as these "
"companies permit. Sony was caught last year installing a "
"&ldquo;rootkit&rdquo; into millions of people's computers, and not telling "
"them how to remove it. Sony has learned its lesson: it will install the "
"&ldquo;rootkit&rdquo; in your computer before you get it, and you won't be "
"able to remove it.  This plan explicitly requires devices to be "
"&ldquo;robust&rdquo;&mdash;meaning you cannot change them. Its implementors "
"will surely want to include GPL-covered software, trampling freedom "
"No. 1. This scheme should get &ldquo;AACSed,&rdquo; and a boycott of HD DVD "
"and Blu-ray has already been announced (<a "

"Allowing a few businesses to organize a scheme to deny our freedoms for "
"their profit is a failure of government, but so far most of the world's "
"governments, led by the U.S., have acted as paid accomplices rather than "
"policemen for these schemes. The copyright industry has promulgated its "
"peculiar ideas of right and wrong so vigorously that some readers may find "
"it hard to entertain the idea that individual freedom can trump their "
"profits."

"Facing these threats to our freedom, what should the free software community "
"do? Some say we should give in and accept the distribution of our software "
"in ways that don't allow modified versions to function, because this will "
"make our software more popular. Some refer to free software as &ldquo;open "
"source,&rdquo; that being the slogan of an amoral approach to the matter, "
"which cites powerful and reliable software as the highest goals.  If we "
"allow companies to use our software to restrict us, this &ldquo;open source "
"DRM&rdquo; could help them restrict us more powerfully and reliably.  Those "
"who wield the power could benefit by sharing and improving the source code "
"of the software they use to do so. We too could read that source "
"code&mdash;read it and weep, if we can't make a changed version run. For the "
"goals of freedom and community&mdash;the goals of the free software "
"movement&mdash;this concession would amount to failure."

"We developed the GNU operating system so that we could control our own "
"computers, and cooperate freely in using them in freedom. To seek popularity "
"for our software by ceding this freedom would defeat the purpose; at best, "
"we might flatter our egos. Therefore we have designed version 3 of the GNU "
"GPL to uphold the user's freedom to modify the source code and put modified "
"versions to real use."

"The debate about the GPL v3 is part of a broader debate about DRM versus "
"your rights. The motive for DRM schemes is to increase profits for those who "
"impose them, but their profit is a side issue when millions of people's "
"freedom is at stake; desire for profit, though not wrong in itself, cannot "
"justify denying the public control over its technology.  Defending freedom "
"means thwarting DRM."
