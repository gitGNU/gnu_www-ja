"In the 1980s, proprietary software users discovered the problem of <em>the "
"bug that nobody is allowed to understand</em>. When a problem occurs in the "
"interaction of multiple proprietary software packages with different "
"developers, none of them is allowed to study the source code of all the "
"pertinent programs. As a result, none of them can understand the bad "
"interaction between them, and the bug is never fixed except by accident."
