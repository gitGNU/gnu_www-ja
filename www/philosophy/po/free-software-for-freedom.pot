"In 1998, some of the people in the free software community began using the "
"term <a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">&ldquo;open source "
"software&rdquo;</a> instead of <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">&ldquo;free software&rdquo;</a> to "
"describe what they do.  The term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; quickly became "
"associated with a different approach, a different philosophy, different "
"values, and even a different criterion for which licenses are acceptable.  "
"The Free Software movement and the Open Source movement are today <a "
"href=\"#relationship\"> separate movements</a> with different views and "
"goals, although we can and do work together on some practical projects."

"The fundamental difference between the two movements is in their values, "
"their ways of looking at the world.  For the Open Source movement, the issue "
"of whether software should be open source is a practical question, not an "
"ethical one.  As one person put it, &ldquo;Open source is a development "
"methodology; free software is a social movement.&rdquo; For the Open Source "
"movement, non-free software is a suboptimal solution.  For the Free Software "
"movement, non-free software is a social problem and free software is the "

"Radical groups in the 1960s developed a reputation for factionalism: "

"The relationship between the Free Software movement and the Open Source "

"The term &ldquo;free software&rdquo; has an ambiguity problem: an unintended "

"just as well as the intended meaning, &ldquo;software which gives the user "
"certain freedoms.&rdquo; We address this problem by publishing a <a "

"Unfortunately, all the alternatives in English have problems of their own.  "

"The official definition of &ldquo;open source software,&rdquo; as published "
"by the Open Source Initiative, is very close to our definition of free "
"software; however, it is a little looser in some respects, and they have "
"accepted a few licenses that we consider unacceptably restrictive of the "
"users.  However, the obvious meaning for the expression &ldquo;open source "
"software&rdquo; is &ldquo;You can look at the source code.&rdquo; This is a "
"much weaker criterion than free software; it includes free software, but "
"also some <a href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware\"> "
"proprietary</a> programs, including Xv, and Qt under its original license "
"(before the QPL)."

"That obvious meaning for &ldquo;open source&rdquo; is not the meaning that "

msgid "Fear of Freedom"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The main argument for the term &ldquo;open source software&rdquo; is that "
"&ldquo;free software&rdquo; makes some people uneasy.  That's true: talking "
"about freedom, about ethical issues, about responsibilities as well as "
"convenience, is asking people to think about things they might rather "
"ignore.  This can trigger discomfort, and some people may reject the idea "
"for that.  It does not follow that society would be better off if we stop "
"talking about these things."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Years ago, free software developers noticed this discomfort reaction, and "
"some started exploring an approach for avoiding it.  They figured that by "
"keeping quiet about ethics and freedom, and talking only about the immediate "
"practical benefits of certain free software, they might be able to "
"&ldquo;sell&rdquo; the software more effectively to certain users, "
"especially business.  The term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; is offered as a way "
"of doing more of this&mdash;a way to be &ldquo;more acceptable to "
"business.&rdquo; The views and values of the Open Source movement stem from "
"this decision."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This approach has proved effective, in its own terms.  Today many people are "
"switching to free software for purely practical reasons.  That is good, as "
"far as it goes, but that isn't all we need to do! Attracting users to free "
"software is not the whole job, just the first step."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Sooner or later these users will be invited to switch back to proprietary "
"software for some practical advantage.  Countless companies seek to offer "
"such temptation, and why would users decline? Only if they have learned to "
"<em>value the freedom</em> free software gives them, for its own sake.  It "
"is up to us to spread this idea&mdash;and in order to do that, we have to "
"talk about freedom.  A certain amount of the &ldquo;keep quiet&rdquo; "
"approach to business can be useful for the community, but we must have "
"plenty of freedom talk too."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"At present, we have plenty of &ldquo;keep quiet&rdquo;, but not enough "
"freedom talk.  Most people involved with free software say little about "
"freedom&mdash;usually because they seek to be &ldquo;more acceptable to "
"business.&rdquo; Software distributors especially show this pattern.  Some "
"<a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux</a> operating system "
"distributions add proprietary packages to the basic free system, and they "
"invite users to consider this an advantage, rather than a step backwards "
"from freedom."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"We are failing to keep up with the influx of free software users, failing to "
"teach people about freedom and our community as fast as they enter it.  This "
"is why non-free software (which Qt was when it first became popular), and "
"partially non-free operating system distributions, find such fertile "
"ground.  To stop using the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; now would be a mistake; "
"we need more, not less, talk about freedom."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"If those using the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; draw more users into our "
"community, that is a contribution, but the rest of us will have to work even "
"harder to bring the issue of freedom to those users' attention.  We have to "
"say, &ldquo;It's free software and it gives you freedom!&rdquo;&mdash;more "

"The advocates of &ldquo;open source software&rdquo; tried to make it a "

"At the &ldquo;Open Source Developers Day&rdquo; meeting in August 1998, "
