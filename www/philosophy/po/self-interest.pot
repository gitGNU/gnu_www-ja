"The quick answer is, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And few of the better-known "
"theoreticians of the free-market have ever thought that self-interest was, "
"or even could be, sufficient to organize, or long maintain, a free economy.  "
"Among those theoreticians, Adam Smith is often regarded as having been the "
"primary philosopher of self-interest. In a book written to correct a number "
"of misunderstandings of Smith's teachings, we find the following summaries "
"of Smith's view about self-interest:"

"Far from being an individualist, Smith believed it is the influence of "
"society that transforms people into moral beings. He thought that people "
"often misjudge their own self-interest."

"As Adam Smith certainly realized, self-interest will be one of the principal "
"forces organizing economic activities in any society, but that is as true of "
"the most repressive or brutal society as it is of a relatively free and open "
"society. Most of us will not like the results of self-interest untempered by "
"a respect for other creatures.  As a recent example, in running their "
"country to the disadvantage of most Soviet citizens, the leaders of the "
"Communist Party and of the Soviet military and intelligence services were "
"advancing their own self-interests, at least as they understood or "
"misunderstood those interests."

"The advantages enjoyed by Americans over citizens of the Soviet countries, "
"and the advantages we still enjoy over the nominally free citizens of Russia "
"and other eastern European countries, are those of a society organized to "
"allow a high percentage of Americans to act in such a way as to serve both "
"their self-interest and some substantial stock of moral principles. Not only "
"our habits and customs, but also our positive laws &mdash; such as those of "
"copyright &mdash; enter into that organization of our society, for good or "
"bad, but not in a morally neutral manner."

"Self-interest is not necessarily evil, though it can lead people to act in "
"morally reprehensible ways. The love of self, and the consequent development "
"of self-interest, is one aspect of a creature who is also a social, and "
"hence moral, being. Self-interest itself can serve moral interests in a free "
"society so long as that society has the proper foundations. The elements of "
"those foundations include not only a populace sharing a substantial body of "
"moral beliefs and habits but also the formal political structures, positive "
"laws, and accepted court decisions capable of supporting both social order "
"and personal freedom. Once those are in place, and once they have been "
"internalized by the bulk of the citizens, then self-interest will provide a "
"fuel of sorts to keep an economy functioning effectively without leading to "
"immoral results on the whole. The question is always: Is our society "
"organized properly, in its positive laws and in the habits we teach our "
"children and reinforce in ourselves, so that self-interest and moral "
"principles do not generally come into conflict?"

"Those people aware of modern mathematics or of programming techniques should "
"appreciate the recursive, and inherently unstable, interactions between "
"individual morality and social structure. To oversimplify in a useful "
"manner: People with substantial moral beliefs organize societies along those "
"beliefs and those societies then begin to form the habits and beliefs of "
"children, immigrants, etc. according to those same beliefs. Always, it is a "
"messy historical process which can be destroyed or rerouted into less "
"desirable paths. There is inevitably a question as to whether we are "
"straying from a proper path and also a question as to how robust the society "
"is, i.e., how much of a disturbance it would take to destroy much of what is "
"good about that society."

"Sometimes, good people will decide that something has gone wrong and it is "
"time to fight for a moral principle even if it becomes necessary to "
"sacrifice, or at least qualify, their own self-interest. In the words of "
"Thomas Sowell, a free-market theorist of our time:"

"There are, of course, noneconomic values.  Indeed, there are <em>only</em> "
"noneconomic values. Economics is not a value itself but merely a method of "
"trading off one value against another.  If statements about "
"&lsquo;noneconomic values&rsquo; (or, more specifically, &lsquo;social "
"values&rsquo; or &lsquo;human values&rsquo;) are meant to deny the inherent "
"reality of trade-offs, or to exempt some particular value from the trade-off "
"process, then such selfless ideals can be no more effectively demonstrated "
"than by trading off financial gains in the interest of such ideals. This is "
"an economic trade-off. <tt>[from page 79 of &ldquo;Knowledge &amp; "
"Decisions&rdquo;, Thomas Sowell, New York: Basic Books, 1980.]</tt>"

"In context, Professor Sowell was not arguing against those imputing some "
"sort of moral power to self-interest; he was instead arguing against those "
"who think there should be an easy path to the reform of a society which may "
"have a particular moral defect. Those are two sides to the same coin &mdash; "
"serving self-interest may put a person in conflict with moral values and the "
"attempt to serve moral values may lead to some sacrifice of one's "
"self-interest."

"Self-interest can be a powerful fuel for a society, at least when the "
"citizens of that society are well-formed individuals, but there is no "
"mystical or magical aspect to self-interest that guarantees moral "
"results. Self-interest will lead to generally moral results to the extent "
"that moral constraints, external but mostly internal, guide the actions of "
"the self-interested parties. A society with the proper constraints does not "
"come into existence by some act of magic, but rather by the acts of people "
"who are aiming at a higher purpose, whether the preservation of liberty in "
"the society as a whole or the preservation of a cooperative spirit within "
"communities of programmers, or maybe both of those at the same time."
