<h2>Reject IP Enforcement Directive</h2>

<p>
A coalition of civil liberties and consumer groups opposes a new
proposed directive for stricter punishment for copyright and patent
infringement:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://ipjustice.org/wp/2008/03/25/ipj-white-paper-acta-2008/">http://ipjustice.org/wp/2008/03/25/ipj-white-paper-acta-2008/</a>
</p>

<p>
The FSF also opposes this directive, but we did not sign that
statement because it accepts too much of what ought to be opposed.  EU
law is already too restrictive, and simply to prevent further changes
is not enough.  It is wrong to stop people from sharing music and
other published works, and only draconian laws could possibly do the
job, so it's no surprise to see they are being proposed.  But opposing
this directive without criticizing its unjust motivation is
insufficient.  Even using the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;
is a point of weakness, because this is
a <a href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty">
propaganda term</a> for those who aim to restrict the public.
