<h2>Proprietary Software</h2>

<p>Proprietary software, nonfree software, is software that doesn't
respect users' freedom and community.  The developer or owner has
power over its users.  That in itself is an injustice, but it leads to
more injustice.  Power corrupts, so the program's owner often takes
advantage of it to do further nasty things to the users.</p>

    Management</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The way to avoid these forms of abuse is by insisting on
<a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free (freedom-respecting) software.</a>  Since
free software is controlled by its users, they have a chance to defend
themselves and each other against malicious software functions.</p>
