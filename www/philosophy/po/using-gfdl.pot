"If you know someone who is writing a manual about free software, and looking "
"towards commercial publication, you have a chance to help the Free Software "
"Movement a great deal with a small amount of work: by suggesting the idea of "
"publishing the manual under the <a href=\"/copyleft/fdl.html\">GNU Free "
"Documentation License</a>."

"Until recently, commercial book publication almost always implied a nonfree "
"book.  But just as free commercial software has been increasing for a while, "
"now free commercial documentation is starting to take off as well.  Some of "
"the major commercial publishers of documentation about the <a href= "
"\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux system</a>, and about free software in "
"general, are now willing to publish books under the GNU FDL, and pay the "
"authors in the usual way&mdash;IF the authors are firm about this."

"But publishers are likely to first propose an ordinary proprietary book. And "
"if the authors agree, that's what it will be.  So it is essential for "
"authors to take the lead; to say, &ldquo;We want to use the GNU FDL for this "
"book&rdquo;.  So when your friend mentions writing a manual, you can "
"influence the course of events simply by pointing out this possibility."

"There are <a href=\"/licenses/license-list.html#DocumentationLicenses\"> "
"other</a> legitimate free documentation licenses, but sometimes using them "
"requires care. For example, one license is equipped with two optional "
"clauses that can be enabled; the license is free if neither optional clause "
"is used, but enabling either of them makes the book nonfree.  (See <a "
"href=\"/licenses/license-list.html\"> "
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html.</a>) Authors that want to "
"publish free documentation, but using a license other than the GNU FDL, can "
"contact us so we can check that the license really qualifies for free "
"documentation."

"When a commercial manual is free and relates to the GNU system, the GNU "
"Project can recommend it to the public.  So if the authors or publisher set "
"up a web page to describe it and/or sell copies, we can make a link to that "
"page from <a "
"href=\"/doc/other-free-books.html\">www.gnu.org/doc/other-free-books.html</a>, "
"provided the page meets our usual criteria (for instance, it should not link "
"to other pages about nonfree software or documentation, and should not be "
"obnoxious about trying to persuade people to buy).  Please inform <a "
"href=\"mailto:webmasters@gnu.org\"> &lt;webmasters@gnu.org&gt;</a> about "
