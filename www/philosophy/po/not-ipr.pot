"It has become fashionable to toss copyright, patents, and "
"trademarks&mdash;three separate and different entities involving three "
"separate and different sets of laws&mdash;plus a dozen other laws into one "
"pot and call it &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;.  The distorting and "
"confusing term did not become common by accident.  Companies that gain from "
"the confusion promoted it.  The clearest way out of the confusion is to "
"reject the term entirely."

"According to Professor Mark Lemley, now of the Stanford Law School, the "
"widespread use of the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; is a fashion "
"that followed the 1967 founding of the World &ldquo;Intellectual "
"Property&rdquo; Organization (WIPO), and only became really common in recent "
"years. (WIPO is formally a UN organization, but in fact represents the "
"interests of the holders of copyrights, patents, and trademarks.) Wide use "
"dates from <a "

"The term carries a bias that is not hard to see: it suggests thinking about "
"copyright, patents and trademarks by analogy with property rights for "
"physical objects. (This analogy is at odds with the legal philosophies of "
"copyright law, of patent law, and of trademark law, but only specialists "
"know that.) These laws are in fact not much like physical property law, but "
"use of this term leads legislators to change them to be more so.  Since that "
"is the change desired by the companies that exercise copyright, patent and "
"trademark powers, the bias introduced by the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo; suits them."

"The bias is reason enough to reject the term, and people have often asked me "
"to propose some other name for the overall category&mdash;or have proposed "
"their own alternatives (often humorous).  Suggestions include IMPs, for "
"Imposed Monopoly Privileges, and GOLEMs, for Government-Originated Legally "
"Enforced Monopolies.  Some speak of &ldquo;exclusive rights regimes&rdquo;, "
"but referring to restrictions as &ldquo;rights&rdquo; is doublethink too."

"Some of these alternative names would be an improvement, but it is a mistake "
"to replace &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; with any other term.  A "
"different name will not address the term's deeper problem: "
"overgeneralization.  There is no such unified thing as &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo;&mdash;it is a mirage.  The only reason people think it makes "
"sense as a coherent category is that widespread use of the term has misled "
"them."

"The term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; is at best a catch-all to lump "
"together disparate laws.  Nonlawyers who hear one term applied to these "
"various laws tend to assume they are based on a common principle and "
"function similarly."

"Nothing could be further from the case.  These laws originated separately, "
"evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and "
"raise different public policy issues."

"Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the "
"details of expression of a work.  Patent law was intended to promote the "
"publication of useful ideas, at the price of giving the one who publishes an "
"idea a temporary monopoly over it&mdash;a price that may be worth paying in "
"some fields and not in others."

"Trademark law, by contrast, was not intended to promote any particular way "
"of acting, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.  "
"Legislators under the influence of the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo;, however, have turned it into a scheme that provides "
"incentives for advertising."

"Since these laws developed independently, they are different in every "
"detail, as well as in their basic purposes and methods.  Thus, if you learn "
"some fact about copyright law, you'd be wise to assume that patent law is "
"different.  You'll rarely go wrong!"

"People often say &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; when they really mean "
"some larger or smaller category.  For instance, rich countries often impose "
"unjust laws on poor countries to squeeze money out of them.  Some of these "
"laws are &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; laws, and others are not; "
"nonetheless, critics of the practice often grab for that label because it "
"has become familiar to them.  By using it, they misrepresent the nature of "
"the issue.  It would be better to use an accurate term, such as "
"&ldquo;legislative colonization&rdquo;, that gets to the heart of the "
"matter."

"Laymen are not alone in being confused by this term.  Even law professors "
"who teach these laws are lured and distracted by the seductiveness of the "
"term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;, and make general statements that "
"conflict with facts they know.  For example, one professor wrote in 2006:"
msgstr ""

"Unlike their descendants who now work the floor at WIPO, the framers of the "
"US constitution had a principled, procompetitive attitude to intellectual "
"property.  They knew rights might be necessary, but&hellip;they tied "
"congress's hands, restricting its power in multiple ways."
msgstr ""

"That statement refers to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the US "
"Constitution, which authorizes copyright law and patent law.  That clause, "
"though, has nothing to do with trademark law or various others.  The term "
"&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; led that professor to make false "
"generalization."

"The term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; also leads to simplistic "
"thinking.  It leads people to focus on the meager commonality in form that "
"these disparate laws have&mdash;that they create artificial privileges for "
"certain parties&mdash;and to disregard the details which form their "
"substance: the specific restrictions each law places on the public, and the "
"consequences that result.  This simplistic focus on the form encourages an "
"&ldquo;economistic&rdquo; approach to all these issues."
msgstr ""

"Economics operates here, as it often does, as a vehicle for unexamined "
"assumptions.  These include assumptions about values, such as that amount of "
"production matters while freedom and way of life do not, and factual "
"assumptions which are mostly false, such as that copyrights on music "
"supports musicians, or that patents on drugs support life-saving research."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Another problem is that, at the broad scale implicit in the term "
"&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;, the specific issues raised by the "
"various laws become nearly invisible.  These issues arise from the specifics "
"of each law&mdash;precisely what the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo; encourages people to ignore.  For instance, one issue "
"relating to copyright law is whether music sharing should be allowed; patent "
"law has nothing to do with this.  Patent law raises issues such as whether "
"poor countries should be allowed to produce life-saving drugs and sell them "
"cheaply to save lives; copyright law has nothing to do with such matters."

"Neither of these issues is solely economic in nature, and their noneconomic "
"aspects are very different; using the shallow economic overgeneralization as "
"the basis for considering them means ignoring the differences.  Putting the "
"two laws in the &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; pot obstructs clear "
"thinking about each one."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Thus, any opinions about &ldquo;the issue of intellectual property&rdquo; "
"and any generalizations about this supposed category are almost surely "
"foolish.  If you think all those laws are one issue, you will tend to choose "
"your opinions from a selection of sweeping overgeneralizations, none of "
"which is any good."

"If you want to think clearly about the issues raised by patents, or "
"copyrights, or trademarks, or various other different laws, the first step "
"is to forget the idea of lumping them together, and treat them as separate "
"topics.  The second step is to reject the narrow perspectives and simplistic "
"picture the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; suggests.  Consider "
"each of these issues separately, in its fullness, and you have a chance of "
"considering them well."
