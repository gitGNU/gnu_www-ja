"It is a mistake to focus our criticism <a "

"Microsoft is evil, since it makes non-free software.  Even worse, it "

"Management</a> in that software.  But many other companies do one or both of "
"these."

"If you write free software, it is often an opportunity to dramatically "

"Free software projects, and policies that affect software development (such "
