<h2>A Response Letter to the Word Attachments</h2>

<p>
This is an automatic message:
</p>
<p>
The document you have sent is not an Internet mail format.  It is a
proprietary format that is unreadable on several types of computers,
including those used by visually-impaired readers and older computers
used in foreign countries. In most cases, the size of the file is
substantially larger than a plain-text file containing the same
information.  (Even if it LOOKS like plain-text to you, chances are it
is not, and contains a considerable amount of unnecessary formatting
codes, printer information, etc.) In addition, Microsoft Word
documents are often infected with viruses.  Excel, Access, and Power
Point files are also vulnerable to infection.
</p>
<p>
Please &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; DOS Text, HTML or Portable Document
Format (PDF) and send the resulting file as an attachment.  Another
option is to simply type your message directly into mail (not
Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Word) then you won't need to use an
attachment at all.
</p>
<p>
In the highly unlikely event that your document cannot be converted to
an open, non-proprietary format, consider posting it on a web page,
and sending e-mail with the URL which points to the file.
</p>
<p>
Thank you.
