"Geofrey Yu, Assistant Director General in charge of Copyright at WIPO, said "
"this in a paper &ldquo;Public Awareness of Copyright&rdquo;, in June 2002.  "
"It is interesting that WIPO is starting to find that the hypocrisy of "
"describing a system of restricting the public as a matter of "
"&ldquo;rights&rdquo; is starting to backfire on them."

"First the message.  For it to go over well, I recommend downplaying the "
"reference to &lsquo;rights&rsquo;.  the term itself is perfectly acceptable, "
"but in daily usage, it has a negative connotation of rights without "
"corresponding obligations and has a [sic] &lsquo;us&rsquo; against "
"&lsquo;them&rsquo; implication.  This won't do, therefore, as we want to win "
"the public and consumer to our side.  Unfortunately, we cannot turn the "
"clock back and find a new term in place of &lsquo;copyright&rsquo; but we "
"can at least down-play the term &lsquo;rights&rsquo;.  The WIPO Performance "
"and the Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) is about the protection of performers and "
"phonogram producers.  The word &lsquo;right&rsquo; is happily missing in "
"their titles.  And we should take out cure from them."

"Within the copyright community such as we are today in this room, it is fine "
"to refer to artists, composers, performers and enterprises as &lsquo;rights "
"holders&rsquo;.  But it is poor public relations to employ the same terms "
"when speaking to politicians, consumers users and the public.  With them, we "
"must use the terms devoid of legal jargon, terms, which are at least as "
"neutral or better still, inclusive,conveying meanings with which the public "
"can identify.  So &lsquo;rights holders&rsquo; should become painters, "
"writers, sculptors, musicians."

"What goes down well today with general audiences are terms like "
"&lsquo;culture&rsquo;, &lsquo;creativity&rsquo;, &lsquo;information&rsquo; , "
"&lsquo;entertainment&rsquo;, &lsquo;cultural diversity&rsquo;, "
"&lsquo;cultural heritage&rsquo;, &lsquo;reward for creativity&rsquo;, "
"&lsquo;cultural enrichment&rsquo;.  And when we talk to youngsters, terms "
"like &lsquo;fun&rsquo;, &lsquo;hip&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cool&rsquo; will find "
"an echo.  We must find the right slogans too.  At WIPO we coined a slogan "
"for a Geneva cultural festival that we sponsored which went &ldquo;Soutenons "
"les artistes et respectons leurs creations.&rdquo;"

"In the same way, in our public outreach messages, it is better to avoid "
"terms like &ldquo;copyright industries&rdquo;. To call music making and "
"movie-making &ldquo;copyright industries&rdquo; is to cast a business which "
"is about people, imagination, fun, and creative energy in a money-centred, "
"legalistic light.  It is like calling car-making a patent industry.  If we "
"must use the term &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; for brevity's sake, let us call "
"the industries &ldquo;copyright-based industries&rdquo;."

"To sum up, what I would suggest is we down-play business and economics when "
"speaking to the public and stress more the human, creative, inspirational "
"angle."

"What can we see here? First, look how openly WIPO admits (among friends) "
"that it takes the side of the copyright holders.  There isn't even a fig "
"leaf for the interests of anyone else, or even for the idea that copyright "
"must be required to benefit the public (by promoting progress at a "
"reasonable social cost)."

"Another is that the irony that the term &ldquo;Intellectual Property "
"Rights&rdquo; was adopted by the monopoly holders, precisely so that they "
"could present their privileges as rights that could not be denied.  The idea "
"that they might have obligations as well as rights, or that their power "
"might be limited, is supposed to be unthinkable.  And who would ever believe "
"that the music and movie factories were &ldquo;money-centred and "
"legalistic&rdquo;?"

"If the hypocrisy of &ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; is starting "
"to backfire on WIPO, this does not mean we should use that term ourselves.  "
"If we did, we would be spreading WIPO-style hypocrisy, whether we intended "
"to or not."
