"In the GNU Project we usually recommend people use <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/copyleft.html\">copyleft</a> licenses like GNU GPL, rather "
"than permissive non-copyleft free software licenses.  We don't argue harshly "
"against the non-copyleft licenses&mdash;in fact, we occasionally recommend "
"them in special circumstances&mdash;but the advocates of those licenses show "
"a pattern of arguing harshly against the <acronym title=\"General Public "
"License\">GPL</acronym>."

"In one such argument, a person stated that his use of one of the BSD "
"licenses was an &ldquo;act of humility&rdquo;: &ldquo;I ask nothing of those "
"who use my code, except to credit me.&rdquo; It is rather a stretch to "
"describe a legal demand for credit as &ldquo;humility&rdquo;, but there is a "
"deeper point to be considered here."

"Humility is abnegating your own self interest, but you and the one who uses "
"your code are not the only ones affected by your choice of which free "
"software license to use for your code.  Someone who uses your code in a "
"nonfree program is trying to deny freedom to others, and if you let him do "
"it, you're failing to defend their freedom.  When it comes to defending the "
"freedom of others, to lie down and do nothing is an act of weakness, not "
"humility."

"Releasing your code under one of the BSD licenses, or some other permissive "
"non-copyleft license, is not doing wrong; the program is still free "
"software, and still a contribution to our community.  But it is weak, and in "
"most cases it is not the best way to promote users' freedom to share and "
"change software."
