"&ldquo;Twenty-five years ago <a href=\"/gnu/initial-announcement.html\">on "
"September 27, 1983, I announced a plan</a> to create a completely free "
"operating system called GNU&mdash;for &lsquo;GNU's Not Unix&rsquo;.  As part "
"of the 25th anniversary of the GNU system, I have written this article on "
"how our community can avoid ruinous compromises.  In addition to avoiding "
"such compromises, there are many ways you can <a "
"href=\"/help/help.html\">help GNU</a> and free software.  One basic way is "
"to <a "
"href=\"https://www.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom/join_fsf?referrer=4052\"> "
"join the Free Software Foundation</a> as an Associate "
"Member.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>Richard Stallman</b>"

"The free software movement aims for a social change: <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">to make all software free</a> so that all "
"software users are free and can be part of a community of cooperation.  "
"Every nonfree program gives its developer unjust power over the users.  Our "
"goal is to put an end to that injustice."

"The road to freedom is <a "
"href=\"http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/\"> "
"a long road</a>.  It will take many steps and many years to reach a world in "
"which it is normal for software users to have freedom.  Some of these steps "
"are hard, and require sacrifice.  Some of them become easier if we make "
"compromises with people that have different goals."

"Thus, the <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/\">Free Software Foundation</a> makes "
"compromises&mdash;even major ones.  For instance, we made compromises in the "
"patent provisions of version 3 of the <a href=\"/licenses/gpl.html\">GNU "
"General Public License</a> (GNU GPL) so that major companies would "
"contribute to and distribute GPLv3-covered software and thus bring some "
"patents under the effect of these provisions."

"<a href=\"/licenses/lgpl.html\">The Lesser GPL</a>'s purpose is a "
"compromise: we use it on certain chosen free libraries to permit their use "
"in nonfree programs because we think that legally prohibiting this would "
"only drive developers to proprietary libraries instead.  We accept and "
"install code in GNU programs to make them work together with common nonfree "
"programs, and we document and publicize this in ways that encourage users of "
"the latter to install the former, but not vice versa.  We support specific "
"campaigns we agree with, even when we don't fully agree with the groups "
"behind them."

"But we reject certain compromises even though many others in our community "
"are willing to make them.  For instance, we <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html\"> endorse only "
"the GNU/Linux distributions</a> that have policies not to include nonfree "
"software or lead users to install it.  To endorse nonfree distributions "
"would be a <acronym title=\"ruinous (r&#363;'&#601;-n&#601;s) "

"Compromises are ruinous if they would work against our aims in the long "

"At the level of ideas, ruinous compromises are those that reinforce the "
"premises we seek to change.  Our goal is a world in which software users are "
"free, but as yet most computer users do not even recognize freedom as an "
"issue.  They have taken up &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; values, which means they "
"judge any program only on practical characteristics such as price and "
"convenience."

"Dale Carnegie's classic self-help book, <cite>How to Win Friends and "
"Influence People</cite>, advises that the most effective way to persuade "
"someone to do something is to present arguments that appeal to his values.  "
"There are ways we can appeal to the consumer values typical in our society.  "
"For instance, free software obtained gratis can save the user money.  Many "
"free programs are convenient and reliable, too.  Citing those practical "
"benefits has succeeded in persuading many users to adopt various free "
"programs, some of which are now quite successful."

"If getting more people to use some free programs is as far as you aim to go, "
"you might decide to keep quiet about the concept of freedom, and focus only "
"on the practical advantages that make sense in terms of consumer values.  "
"That's what the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; and its associated rhetoric "
"do."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"That approach can get us only part way to the goal of freedom.  People who "
"use free software only because it is convenient will stick with it only as "
"long as it is convenient.  And they will see no reason not to use convenient "
"proprietary programs along with it."

"To establish a free community fully and lastingly, we need to do more than "
"get people to use some free software.  We need to spread the idea of judging "
"software (and other things) on &ldquo;citizen values&rdquo;, based on "
"whether it respects users' freedom and community, not just in terms of "
"convenience.  Then people will not fall into the trap of a proprietary "
"program baited by an attractive, convenient feature."

"To promote citizen values, we have to talk about them and show how they are "

"This is not to say we cannot cite practical advantage at all&mdash;we can "
"and we do.  It becomes a problem only when the practical advantage steals "
"the scene and pushes freedom into the background.  Therefore, when we cite "
"the practical advantages of free software, we reiterate frequently that "
"those are just <em>additional, secondary</em> reasons to prefer it."

"It's not enough to make our words accord with our ideals; our actions have "

"For instance, experience shows that you can attract some users to <a "
"href=\"/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html\">GNU/Linux</a> if you include some nonfree "
"programs.  This could mean a cute nonfree application that will catch some "
"user's eye, or a nonfree programming platform such as <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/java-trap.html\">Java</a> (formerly) or the Flash runtime "

"These compromises are tempting, but they undermine the goal.  If you "
"distribute nonfree software, or steer people towards it, you will find it "
"hard to say, &ldquo;Nonfree software is an injustice, a social problem, and "
"we must put an end to it.&rdquo; And even if you do continue to say those "
"words, your actions will undermine them."

"The issue here is not whether people should be <em>able</em> or "
"<em>allowed</em> to install nonfree software; a general-purpose system "
"enables and allows users to do whatever they wish.  The issue is whether we "
"guide users towards nonfree software.  What they do on their own is their "
"responsibility; what we do for them, and what we direct them towards, is "
"ours.  We must not direct the users towards proprietary software as if it "
"were a solution, because proprietary software is the problem."

"A ruinous compromise is not just a bad influence on others.  It can distort "
"your own values, too, through cognitive dissonance.  If you have certain "
"values, but your actions imply other, conflicting values, you are likely to "
"change your values or your actions so as to resolve the contradiction.  "
"Thus, projects that argue only from practical advantages, or direct people "
"toward some nonfree software, nearly always shy away from even "
"<em>suggesting</em> that nonfree software is unethical.  For their "
"participants, as well as for the public, they reinforce consumer values.  We "
"must reject these compromises if we wish to keep our values straight."

"If you want to move to free software without compromising the goal of "
"freedom, look at <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/resources\">the FSF's "

"to install, and <a href=\"http://directory.fsf.org/\"> thousands of free "
"software packages</a> that work in a 100 percent free software environment.  "
"If you want to help the community stay on the road to freedom, one important "
"way is to publicly uphold citizen values.  When people are discussing what "
"is good or bad, or what to do, cite the values of freedom and community and "
"argue from them."
