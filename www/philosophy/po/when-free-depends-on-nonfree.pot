"When a program is free software (free as in freedom), that means it gives "
"users the four freedoms (<a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>)  so "
"that they control what the program does. In most cases, that is sufficient "
"for the program's distribution to be ethical; but not always. There are "
"additional problems that can arise in specific circumstances. This article "
"describes a subtle problem, where upgrading the free program requires using "
"a nonfree program."

"If the free program's use depends unavoidably on another program which is "
"nonfree, we say that the free program is &ldquo;trapped.&rdquo; Its code is "
"free software, and you may be able to copy pieces of its code into other "
"free programs with good, ethical results. But you shouldn't <em>run</em> the "
"trapped program, because that entails surrendering your freedom to the other "
"nonfree program."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Someone who upholds the principles of free software would not knowingly make "
"a program that is trapped. However, many free programs are developed by "
"people or companies that don't particularly support these principles, or "
"don't understand the problem."

"Dependence on a nonfree program can take various forms. The most basic form "
"is when the programming language used has no free implementation. The first "
"programs I wrote for the GNU system in the 1980s, including GNU Emacs, GDB "
"and GNU Make, had to be compiled with AT&amp;T's nonfree C compiler, because "
"there was no free C compiler until I wrote GCC. Fortunately, this kind of "
"problem is mostly a thing of the past; we now have free compilers and "
"platforms for just about all the languages anyone uses for writing free "
"software."

"We can release the program from this kind of trap by translating it to "
"another language, or by releasing a free implementation of the language it's "
"written in. Thus, when a full free Java implementation became available, "
"that released all the free Java programs from the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/java-trap.html\">Java Trap</a>."

"This kind of dependence is conceptually simple because it stems from the "
"situation at one given instant in time. At time T, free program P won't run "
"without nonfree programming platform Q. To borrow a term from linguistics, "
"this relationship is &ldquo;synchronic.&rdquo;"

"More recently, we have seen another kind of dependence in database programs, "
"where you can build and run any given version of the program in the free "
"world, but upgrading from version N to version N+1 requires a nonfree "
"program."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This happens because the internal format of the database changes from "
"version N to version N+1. If you have been seriously using version N, you "
"probably have a large existing database in the version N format.  To upgrade "
"to version N+1 of the database software, you need to reformat that database."

"If the way you are supposed to do this is by running a proprietary database "
"reformat program, or using the developer's service which is SaaSS, the "
"database software is trapped&mdash;but in a more subtle way. Any single "
"version of the database program can be used without nonfree software or "
"SaaSS. The problem arises when you try to keep using the program for the "
"long term, which entails upgrading it from time to time; you can't use it "
"this way without some nonfree software or equivalent. This database program "
"is trapped across time&mdash;we could call it &ldquo;diachronically "
"trapped,&rdquo; borrowing another term from linguistics."

"For example, the program OpenERP, though free, is diachronically trapped. <a "
"href=\"/software/health/\">GNU Health</a>, our free package for running a "
"medical clinic, initially used OpenERP. In 2011, GNU Health developer Luis "
"Falcón discovered that upgrading to the next version of OpenERP required "
"sending the database (full of patients' medical data) to OpenERP's server "
"for reformatting. This is SaaSS (<a "
"href=\"/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html\">Service as a "
"Software Substitute</a>): it requires the user of GNU Health (a clinic) to "
"entrust its own computing and its data to the company developer of "
"OpenERP. Rather than bow down, Falcón rewrote GNU Health to use <a "
"href=\"http://www.tryton.org\">Tryton</a> instead."

"Using SaaSS is inherently equivalent to running a proprietary program with "
"snooping functionality and a universal back door. The service could keep a "
"copy of the databases that users reformat. Even if we can trust the company "
"that runs the service never to intentionally show any form of the data to "
"anyone, we can't be sure that it won't be accessed by <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html\">the intelligence "
"agencies of various countries</a> or security-breaking crackers <a "

"When a program is diachronically trapped, releasing it from the trap "
"requires more than a one-time job of programming. Rather, the job has to be "
"done continually, each time there is a change in the data format. Launching "
"a project with a long-term commitment to continue doing this is not easy. It "
"may be easier to pressure the company to stop trying to trap users&mdash;by "
"rejecting the trapped program until it does so. Given how difficult it is to "
"free the program, you had better stay away from it."

"It is possible to try out a diachronically trapped free program without "
"nonfree software, but if you're going to do more than dabble, you must steer "
"clear of really using it. Both businesses and individuals will find fine "
"free alternatives that don't have such a problem; all it takes to avoid the "
"trap is to recognize it."
