"I grew up in a community whose other members sometimes committed crimes as "
"serious as murder. The city of New York, with its 8 million inhabitants, had "
"hundreds of murders each year, mostly committed by people who lived in the "
"city. Violent assaults and robberies were even more common."

"Other evils involving information rather than physical violence were common "
"also. For instance, some New York police regularly lied on the witness "
"stand, and even made up a word for it: instead of &ldquo;testifying&rdquo;, "
"they described court appearances as &ldquo;testilying&rdquo;. Some New York "
"programmers fell into the lawful but socially destructive practice of "
"proprietary software: they offered other people attractive software packages "
"without source code, and exacted a promise not to share them with anyone "
"else."

"Despite these prevalent evils, never in my life have I seen anyone try to "
"condemn all New Yorkers on the basis of the wrongs that only some have "
"committed. I have not seen anyone assume that all the citizens of New York "
"are guilty of murder, violence, robbery, perjury, or writing proprietary "
"software. People are aware that the mere fact that some New Yorkers were "
"known to have done these things is no justification for treating all of us "
"as guilty. That would be &ldquo;guilt by association,&rdquo; and people know "
"that is unjust."

"I now live in the smaller city of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Murder and "
"robbery occur here, too; I do not know if Cambridge police regularly lie in "
"court, but proprietary software is rife.  Nonetheless, I have never seen "
"anyone try to condemn the whole city of Cambridge for this. Here, too, "
"people recognize that guilt by association is an injustice."

"However, people don't always remember to apply the principle. My virtual "
"community, the free software community which I have helped to build since "
"1984 by developing the GNU operating system, is now the victim of a campaign "
"of guilt by association. A number of articles&mdash;I have seen "
"some&mdash;have tried to hold our entire community guilty for the "
"development of the MyDoom virus."

"We can be pretty sure that some New Yorkers have committed murder, because "
"they have been tried and convicted for it. We do not know whether anyone in "
"the free software community participated in the development of MyDoom. The "
"developers have not been identified; they know who they are, but you and I "
"can only speculate. We could speculate that users of GNU/Linux developed the "
"virus to attack SCO.  We could speculate that Microsoft developed the virus "
"so it would be blamed on us. We could speculate that disgruntled former SCO "
"employees developed the virus to get even. But there is no evidence for any "
"of these speculations."

"If some day we find out that those who developed the virus were free "
"software users, then my virtual community will be in the same situation as "

"This should not surprise anyone. The free software community numbers in the "
"tens of millions, larger than New York or even Shanghai. It is hardly to be "
"expected that so many people would all be ethical. Our community is "
"self-selected for at least partial rejection of one unethical practice, "
"proprietary software, but even that doesn't guarantee perfection. The "
"presence of a few wrongdoers among many millions is no surprise&mdash;and no "
"excuse for guilt by association."

"I am confident that nearly all readers of this article have nothing to do "
"with developing the MyDoom virus. So if someone is accusing you, don't act "
"defensive. You have no more to do with the virus than your accuser, so stand "
"tall and say so."

"If anyone has knowledge or evidence about who developed the virus, I hope he "
"or she will come forth and make an accusation against specific people based "
"on specific proof. But nobody should make accusations without proof, and "
"there is no excuse for guilt by association.  Not in New York, not in "
"Cambridge, and not in the Free World."
