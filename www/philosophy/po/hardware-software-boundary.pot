"What is the boundary, in digital devices, between hardware and software? We "
"can find it by applying the definitions: software is the operational part of "
"a device that can be copied and changed in a computer; hardware is the "
"operational part that can't be.  This is the right way to make the "
"distinction because it relates to the practical consequences."

"Between hardware and software there is a gray area consisting of firmware "
"that <em>can</em> be upgraded or replaced, but is not meant to be upgraded "
"or replaced once the product is sold.  In conceptual terms, the gray area is "
"rather narrow.  In practice, it is important because many products fall in "
"it.  We can treat that firmware as hardware with a small stretch."

"Some have said that preinstalled firmware programs and Field-Programmable "
"Gate Array chips (FPGAs) &ldquo;blur the boundary between hardware and "
"software,&rdquo; but I think that is a misinterpretation of the facts.  "
"Firmware that is installed during use is software; firmware that is "
"delivered inside the device and can't be changed is software by nature, but "
"we can treat it as if it were a circuit.  As for FPGAs, the FPGA itself is "
"hardware, but the gate pattern that is loaded into the FPGA is a kind of "
"firmware."

"Running free gate patterns on FPGAs could potentially be a useful method for "
"making digital devices that are free at the circuit level.  However, to make "
"FPGAs usable in the free world, we need free development tools for them.  "
"The obstacle is that the format of the gate pattern file that gets loaded "
"into the FPGA is secret.  Until recently there was <em>no</em> model of FPGA "
"for which those files could be produced without nonfree (proprietary) tools."

"Thanks to a reverse-engineering effort, it is now possible to compile C "
"programs and run them on the Xilinx Spartan 6 LX9 FPGA.  The tools do not "
"yet support HDL (hardware definition language) code, though, so this does "
"not offer a usable substitute for real digital chips.  Meanwhile, that model "
"of FPGA is starting to get old.  These tools constitute a tremendous advance "
"over the situation a few years ago, but there's a long way to go before "
"FPGAs are fully usable in freedom."

"As for the HDL code itself, it can act as software (when it is run on an "
"emulator or loaded into an FPGA) or as a hardware design (when it is "
"realized in immutable silicon or a circuit board)."
