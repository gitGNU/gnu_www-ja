"Many <a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux</a> users think of the "
"system as competition for Microsoft.  But the Free Software Movement aims to "
"solve a problem that is much bigger than Microsoft: proprietary, nonfree "
"software, designed to keep users helpless and prohibit cooperation.  "
"Microsoft is the largest developer of such software, but many other "
"companies treat the users' freedom just as badly; if they have not shackled "
"as many users as Microsoft, it is not for lack of trying."

"Since Microsoft is just a part of the problem, its defeat in the anti-trust "
"lawsuit is not necessarily a victory for free software.  Whether the outcome "
"of this suit helps free software and promotes users' freedom depends of the "
"specific remedies imposed on Microsoft by the judge."

"If the remedies are designed to enable other companies compete in offering "
"proprietary, nonfree software, that will do the Free World no particular "
"good.  Alternative possible masters is not freedom.  And competition could "
"lead them to do a &ldquo;better&rdquo; job, better in a narrow technical "
"sense; then it could be harder for us to &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with them "
"technically.  We will continue to offer the user one thing those companies "
"do not&mdash;freedom&mdash;and users who value freedom will continue to "
"choose free software for that reason.  But users who do not value freedom, "
"and choose a system based on mere convenience, might be enticed away to "
"&ldquo;improved&rdquo; proprietary systems."

"Splitting Microsoft into separate companies could also endanger free "
"software, because these smaller companies, no longer held in check by the "
"public readiness to condemn Microsoft, might see fit to attack free software "
"more harshly than the present unified Microsoft does."

"I've <a href=\"/philosophy/microsoft-antitrust.html\">proposed remedies</a> "
"for this case that would help free software compete with Microsoft: for "
"example, requiring Microsoft to publish documentation for all interfaces, "
"and to use patents only for defense, not for aggression.  These remedies "
"would block the use of the weapons that Microsoft plans to use against us "
"(according to the &ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo; leaked from within "
"Microsoft which spelled out how they plan to impede development of the "
"GNU/Linux system)."
