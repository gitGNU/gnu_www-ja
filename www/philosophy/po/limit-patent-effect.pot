"Patents threaten every software developer, and the patent wars we have long "

"The patents that threaten us are often called &ldquo;software "
"patents&rdquo;, but that term is misleading.  Such patents are not about any "
"specific program.  Rather, each patent describes some practical idea, and "
"says that anyone carrying out the idea can be sued.  So it is clearer to "
"call them &ldquo;computational idea patents&rdquo;."

"The US patent system doesn't label patents to say this one's a "
"&ldquo;software patent&rdquo; and that one isn't.  Software developers are "
"the ones who make a distinction between the patents that threaten "
"us&mdash;those that cover ideas that can be implemented in "
"software&mdash;and the rest.  For example, if the patented idea is the shape "
"of a physical structure or a chemical reaction, no program can implement "
"that idea; that patent doesn't threaten the software field.  But if the idea "
"that's patented is a computation, that patent's barrel points at software "
"developers and users."

"This is not to say that computational idea patents prohibit only software.  "
"These ideas can also be implemented in hardware&mdash;and many of them have "
"been.  Each patent typically covers both hardware <em>and</em> software "
"implementations of the idea."

"Still, software is where computational idea patents cause a special "
"problem.  In software, it's easy to implement thousands of ideas together in "
"one program.  If 10% are patented, that means hundreds of patents threaten "

"When Dan Ravicher of the Public Patent Foundation studied one large program "
"(Linux, which is the kernel of the <a href=\"/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html\"> "
"GNU/Linux</a> operating system) in 2004, he found 283 US patents that "
"appeared to cover computing ideas implemented in the source code of that "
"program.  That same year, a magazine estimated that Linux was .25% of the "
"whole GNU/Linux system.  Multiplying 300 by 400 we get the "
"order-of-magnitude estimate that the system as a whole was <em>threatened by "
"around 100,000 patents</em>."

"If half of those patents were eliminated as &ldquo;bad "
"quality&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., mistakes of the patent system that is&mdash;it "
"would not really change things.  Whether 100,000 patents or 50,000, it's the "
"same disaster.  This is why it's a mistake to limit our criticism of "
"software patents to just &ldquo;patent trolls&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad "
"quality&rdquo; patents.  The worst patent aggressor today is Apple, which "
"isn't a &ldquo;troll&rdquo; by the usual definition; I don't know whether "
"Apple's patents are &ldquo;good quality&rdquo;, but the better the patent's "
"&ldquo;quality&rdquo; the more dangerous its threat."

"The usual suggestions for correcting this problem legislatively involve "
"changing the criteria for granting patents&mdash;for instance, to ban "
"issuance of patents on computational practices and systems to perform them.  "
"This approach has two drawbacks."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"First, patent lawyers are clever at reformulating patents to fit whatever "
"rules may apply; they transform any attempt at limiting the substance of "
"patents into a requirement of mere form.  For instance, many US "
"computational idea patents describe a system including an arithmetic unit, "
"an instruction sequencer, a memory, plus controls to carry out a particular "
"computation.  This is a peculiar way of describing a computer running a "
"program that does a certain computation; it was designed to make the patent "
"application satisfy criteria that the US patent system was believed for a "
"time to require."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Second, the US already has many thousands of computational idea patents, and "
"changing the criteria to prevent issuing more would not get rid of the "
"existing ones.  We would have to wait almost 20 years for the problem to be "
"entirely corrected through the expiration of these patents.  We could "
"envision legislating the abolition of these existing patents, but that is "
"probably unconstitutional.  (The Supreme Court has perversely insisted that "
"Congress can extend private privileges at the expense of the public's rights "
"but that it can't go in the other direction.)"

"My suggestion is to change the <em>effect</em> of patents.  We should "
"legislate that developing, distributing, or running a program on generally "
"used computing hardware does not constitute patent infringement.  This "
"approach has several advantages:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li>

"It does not require classifying patents or patent applications as "
"&ldquo;software&rdquo; or &ldquo;not software&rdquo;."
msgstr ""

"It provides developers and users with protection from both existing and "
"potential future computational idea patents."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li>
msgid ""
"Patent lawyers cannot defeat the intended effect by writing applications "
"differently."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This approach doesn't entirely invalidate existing computational idea "
"patents, because they would continue to apply to implementations using "
"special-purpose hardware.  This is an advantage because it eliminates an "
"argument against the legal validity of the plan.  The US passed a law some "
"years ago shielding surgeons from patent lawsuits, so that even if surgical "
"procedures are patented, surgeons are safe.  That provides a precedent for "
"this solution."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Software developers and software users need protection from patents.  This "
"is the only legislative solution that would provide full protection for "
"all.  We could then go back to competing or cooperating&hellip; without the "
"fear that some stranger will wipe away our work."
