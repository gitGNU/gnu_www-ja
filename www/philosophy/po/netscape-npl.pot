"(The <a href=\"/philosophy/netscape-npl-old.html\"> original version</a> of "
"this article was written in March 1998 about a draft of the NPL.  Our first "

"The Netscape Public License, or NPL, as it was ultimately designed in 1998, "
"is a free software license&mdash;but it has three major flaws.  One flaw "
"sends a bad philosophical message, another puts the free software community "
"in a weak position, while the third creates a major practical problem within "
"the free software community.  Two of the flaws apply to the Mozilla Public "
"License as well.  Because of these flaws, we urge that you not use the NPL "
"or the MPL for your free software."

msgid ""
"The first problem I noticed in the NPL was that it does not give Netscape "
"and the rest of us equal rights, as the GNU GPL does.  Under the NPL, we can "
"use Netscape's code only as specified in the NPL, but Netscape can use our "
"changes in any way at all&mdash;even in proprietary licensed versions of the "
"software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The problem here is subtle, because this does not make the program "
"non-free.  It does not stop us from redistributing the program, or from "
"changing it; it does not deny us any particular freedom.  Considered from a "
"purely pragmatic viewpoint, it may not look like a problem at all."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The problem lies in the deeper message embodied in this condition.  It "
"denies the idea of cooperation among equals that our community rests on, and "
"says that working on a free program means contributing to a proprietary "
"software product.  Those who accept this condition are likely to be changed "
"by it, and the change will not strengthen our community."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One proposed solution for this asymmetry is to put a time limit on "
"it&mdash;perhaps three or five years.  That would be a big improvement, "
"because the time limit would deny the problematical deeper message."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The practical effects of this condition are minimized by another drawback of "
"the NPL: it is not designed as a thorough copyleft.  In other words, it does "
"not try very hard to ensure that modifications made by users are available "
"as free software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The MPL (Mozilla Public License) does <em>not</em> have this problem.  That "
"is the principal difference between the MPL and the NPL."

msgid "2. Not a copyleft"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The NPL has the form of a copyleft; it explicitly says that all "
"modifications made by users must be released under the NPL.  But this "
"applies only to modifications to the existing code&mdash;not to added "
"subroutines, if they are put in separate files.  As a practical matter, this "
"means it is easy to make proprietary changes if you want to: just put the "
"bulk of your code into a separate file, and call the collection a Larger "
"Work.  Only the subroutine calls added to the old files will have to be "
"released under the NPL, and they will not be very useful on their own."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The lack of real copyleft is not a catastrophe; it does not make the "
"software non-free.  For example, the X.org distribution terms do not try to "
"use copyleft at all, yet X.org is free software nonetheless.  BSD is also "
"non-copylefted free software (although the older BSD terms have a <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/bsd.html\">serious drawback</a> and should not be "
"imitated&mdash;if you want to release non-copylefted free software, please "
"use the X.org terms instead).  NPL-covered software is also <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/categories.html\">free software</a> without being "
"copylefted, and this by itself does not make the NPL worse than other "
"non-copyleft free software license."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"However, while this is not catastrophic, it is nonetheless a drawback.  And "
"because the NPL looks like a copyleft, some users may be confused about it, "
"and might adopt the NPL, thinking that they are obtaining the benefits of "
"copyleft for their software, when that is not the case.  To avoid this "
"outcome, we will need to work hard to educate people about an issue that is "
"not easy to explain in a few words."

msgid "3. Not compatible with the GPL"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The most serious practical problem in the NPL is that it is incompatible "
"with the GNU GPL.  It is impossible to combine NPL-covered code and GNU "
"GPL-covered code together in one program, not even by linking separate "
"object files or libraries; no matter how this is done, it has to violate one "
"license or the other."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This conflict occurs because the GPL is serious about copyleft: it was "
"designed to ensure that all changes and extensions to a free program must be "
"free.  So it does not leave a loophole for making changes proprietary by "
"putting them into a separate file.  To close this loophole, the GPL does not "
"allow linking the copylefted program with code that has other restrictions "
"or conditions&mdash;such as the NPL."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Being incompatible with the GPL does not make a program non-free; it does "
"not raise a fundamental ethical issue.  But it is likely to create a serious "
"problem for the free software community, dividing the code base into two "
"collections that cannot be mixed.  As a practical matter, this problem is "
"very important."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Solving this by changing the GPL is possible, but that would entail "
"abandoning copyleft&mdash;which would do more harm than good.  But it is "
"possible to solve this problem with a small change in the NPL.  (See below "
"for a specific way of doing this.)"

"When people take advantage of A.2, their changes will be released only under "

"However, the NPL gives proprietary software developers an easy way to make "
"their changes entirely unavailable to Netscape&mdash;by putting their code "
"into separate files and calling the combination a Larger Work.  In fact, "
"this is easier, for them, than A.2 is for GPL users."

"If Netscape feels it can live with the trouble of (effectively)  proprietary "
"modifications, surely the trouble of GPL-covered modifications is a small by "
"comparison.  If Netscape believes that practical considerations will "
"encourage most of the proprietary software world to release its changes back "
"to Netscape, without being compelled to, the same reasons ought to apply in "
"the free software world as well.  Netscape should recognize that this change "
"is acceptable, and adopt it, to avoid confronting free software developers "
"with a serious dilemma."
