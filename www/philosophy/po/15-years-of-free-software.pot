"In 1984, it was impossible to use a modern computer without installing a "
"proprietary operating system, which you would have to obtain under a "
"restrictive license. No one was allowed to share software freely with fellow "
"computer users, and hardly anyone could change software to fit his or her "
"own needs. The owners of software had erected walls to divide us from each "
"other."

"The GNU Project was founded to change all that. Its first goal: to develop a "
"Unix-compatible portable operating system that would be 100% free "
"software. Not 95% free, not 99.5%, but 100%&mdash;so that users would be "
"free to redistribute the whole system, and free to change and contribute to "
"any part of it. The name of the system, GNU, is a recursive acronym meaning "
"&ldquo;GNU's Not Unix&rdquo;&mdash;a way of paying tribute to the technical "
"ideas of Unix, while at the same time saying that GNU is something "
"different. Technically, GNU is like Unix. But unlike Unix, GNU gives its "
"users freedom."

"It took many years of work, by hundreds of programmers, to develop this "
"operating system. Some were paid by the Free Software Foundation and by free "
"software companies; most were volunteers. A few have become famous; most are "
"known mainly within their profession, by other hackers who use or work on "
"their code. All together have helped to liberate the potential of the "
"computer network for all humanity."

"In 1991, the last major essential component of a Unix-like system was "
"developed: Linux, the free kernel written by Linus Torvalds. Today, the "
"combination of GNU and Linux is used by millions of people around the world, "
"and its popularity is growing. This month, we announced release 1.0 of "
"<acronym title=\"GNU Network Object Model Environment\">GNOME</acronym>, the "
"GNU graphical desktop, which we hope will make the GNU/Linux system as easy "
"to use as any other operating system."

"But our freedom is not permanently assured. The world does not stand still, "
"and we cannot count on having freedom five years from now, just because we "
"have it today. Free software faces difficult challenges and dangers. It will "
"take determined efforts to preserve our freedom, just as it took to obtain "
"freedom in the first place. Meanwhile, the operating system is just the "
"beginning&mdash;now we need to add free applications to handle the whole "
"range of jobs that users want to do."
