"Almost two decades have passed since the combination of GNU and Linux first "
"made it possible to use a PC in freedom.  We have come a long way since "
"then.  Now you can even buy a laptop with GNU/Linux preinstalled from more "
"than one hardware vendor&mdash;although the systems they ship are not "
"entirely free software.  So what holds us back from total success?"

"The main obstacle to the triumph of software freedom is social inertia.  It "
"exists in many forms, and you have surely seen some of them.  Examples "
"include devices that only work on Windows, commercial web sites accessible "
"only with Windows, and the BBC's iPlayer handcuffware, which runs only on "
"Windows.  If you value short-term convenience instead of freedom, you might "
"consider these reason enough to use Windows.  Most companies currently run "
"Windows, so students who think short-term want to learn how to use it and "
"ask their schools to teach it.  Schools teach Windows, produce graduates "
"that are used to using Windows, and this encourages businesses to use "
"Windows."

"Microsoft actively nurtures this inertia: it encourages schools to inculcate "
"dependency on Windows, and contracts to set up web sites that then turn out "
"to work only with Internet Explorer."

"A few years ago, Microsoft ads argued that Windows was cheaper to run than "
"GNU/Linux.  Their comparisons were debunked, but it is worth noting the "
"deeper flaw in their argument, the implicit premise which cites a form of "
"social inertia: &ldquo;Currently, more technical people know Windows than "
"GNU/Linux.&rdquo; People who value their freedom would not give it up to "
"save money, but many business executives believe ideologically that "
"everything they possess, even their freedom, should be for sale."

"Social inertia consists of people who have given in to social inertia.  When "
"you surrender to social inertia, you become part of the pressure it exerts "
"on others; when you resist it, you reduce it.  We conquer social inertia by "
"identifying it, and resolving not to be part of it."

"Here a weakness holds our community back: most GNU/Linux users have never "
"even heard the ideas of freedom that motivated the development of GNU, so "
"they still judge matters based on short-term convenience rather than on "
"their freedom.  This makes them vulnerable to being led by the nose by "
"social inertia, so that they become part of the inertia."

"To build our community's strength to resist, we need to talk about free "
"software and freedom&mdash;not merely about the practical benefits that open "
"source supporters cite.  As more people recognize what they need to do to "
"overcome the inertia, we will make more progress."
