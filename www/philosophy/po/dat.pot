#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The record industry presents its proposal as a way to "
"&ldquo;compensate&rdquo; musicians, assuming that they are entitled to be "
"paid for any copy made.  Many Americans believe that copyright law reflects "
"a natural right of authors or musicians&mdash;that these are entitled to "
"special consideration from public policy.  However, any lawyer specializing "
"in the field knows this is a misunderstanding, a view rejected by the "
"American legal system."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The stated purpose of copyright, given in the U.S. Constitution, is to "
"&ldquo;promote the progress of science and the useful arts&rdquo;.  Progress "
"in music means new and varied music for the public to enjoy: copyright is "
"supposed to promote a public good, not a private one."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Yet copyright is often thought of as a natural right by laymen and "
"politicians, which often leads to wrong decisions about copyright policy.  "
"Even courts, defining the details of the copyright system, often let this "
"thought creep back implicitly even though it is supposed to be excluded.  "
"This is a conceptual error because it mistakes a means (copyright) to a "
"larger end (progress) for an end in itself."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Promoting progress in the arts does not inherently justify the idea that "
"authors are entitled to any particular sort of copyright, or even that "
"copyright should exist at all.  Copyright is justified if the benefits of "
"progress exceeds the burden that copyright imposes on everyone except the "
"copyright holder."

"How do we make this cost/benefit comparison? It depends partly on facts (how "

"our value judgements about those results."

msgid ""
"Let's assume that it is worth paying a DAT tax if the result is a "
"significant increase in musical activity, and investigate how we should "
"arrange the details of this tax in order to maximize the benefit.  But "

"inquiry."

msgid "Diminishing returns"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The law of diminishing returns is a general principle of economics.  It "
"states that each additional increment of efforts or funds spent on a given "
"goal typically produces a smaller and smaller increment in the results.  "
"There are exceptions to this law, but they are local; if you keep on "
"increasing the inputs, you eventually leave the exceptions behind."

"For example, you can make traffic flow more smoothly by improving roads.  "
"Adding one lane to 20 miles of congested roads in a city might increase the "
"average traffic speed by 15 miles an hour.  Adding a second lane to those "
"roads will not give the same improvement; this might increase the average "
"speed by only 5 more miles an hour.  The next additional lane might make no "
"noticeable difference if the traffic jams are already gone.  Yet each "
"successive lane will cause greater dislocation as more and more buildings "
"must be torn down to make room."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"When applied to the activities of musicians, diminishing returns tells us "
"that each successive increase in the income of musicians will have a smaller "
"effect on the amount of creativity in music."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Diminishing returns is the first reason to reject the idea that any use of "
"music &ldquo;should&rdquo; be covered by copyright.  There is nothing to "
"gain by trying to guarantee owners control of every possible aspect of the "
"use of music or to give them a financial stake in every possible "
"aftermarket.  Extending copyright can only &ldquo;promote progress&rdquo; up "
"to a certain point.  Further extensions merely increase what the public pays "
"to the owners for what they will do anyway.  Extending copyright beyond that "
"point is certainly undesirable."

msgid "Trade-offs"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Those with a vested interest in extending copyright start the discussion by "
"claiming that copyright &ldquo;should&rdquo; be extended as far as it can "
"go.  But the principle of diminishing returns renders this claim "
"implausible.  So they fall back on the position that copyright should be "
"extended to maximize the rate of progress.  But this too is wrong, because "
"it ignores the existence of other trade-offs.  Copyright imposes costs and "
"burdens on the public, like any other government project.  The benefit may "
"not be worth the price."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Government fills many important functions, but few would say that any one of "
"these functions should be expanded to maximize output.  For example, "
"governments build roads, and this is very useful.  But few leaders would "
"advocate building every road that could be built.  Road construction is "
"expensive, and citizens have other uses for their money.  Too much "
"concentration on building roads means that other social and individual needs "
"will be unmet."
msgstr ""

"The same considerations apply to individual decisions.  By spending more "
"money, you can buy a bigger and fancier house.  Most people would prefer the "
"more expensive house, all else being equal.  But given finite resources, at "
"some point spending more on a house becomes a poor allocation of them."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Copyright does not directly spend public funds, but it does impose a "
"cost&mdash;a loss of freedom&mdash;on every citizen.  The wider the scope of "
"copyright, the more freedom we pay.  We might prefer to exercise some of our "
"freedoms rather than trade them away.  We must judge any decision in "
"copyright policy by comparing the benefits with the costs."

msgid "&ldquo;Incentive&rdquo; is the wrong concept"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The idea of providing a monetary incentive for making music is based on a "
"misunderstanding.  Musicians hope primarily for other kinds of reward; they "
"must.  Very few musicians get rich from their music; a talented person whose "
"primary goal is wealth would seek it in other ways."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In fact, psychological studies show that the desire for an extrinsic reward "
"(such as profit) generally hampers creative activities such as writing "
"music.  The people who can do them well are usually those who do them mostly "
"for their own sake."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This is not to say that musicians don't care about being paid.  Most hope to "
"make a living from music so they will be free to devote their time to it.  "
"As long as they earn enough to live, they will make music as best they can.  "
"We might wish them to earn somewhat more than just enough, so they can live "
"as well as most Americans.  But to offer them wealth beyond this gains the "
"public little&mdash;it is a matter of diminishing returns."

"Record companies do provide a useful service: they distribute prerecorded "
"copies of music, usually of high quality.  This service is widely used, and "
"will probably remain so.  And it is right that the purchasers of prerecorded "

"themselves or their friends do not consume this service; they use only the "

msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"It makes sense to distribute the funds based on how much that musician's "
"work is copied, more or less.  But strict proportionality is not the best "
"apportionment.  If each musician gets a share in strict proportion to the "
"amount of copying of his or her music, then a large share will go to make a "
"few superstars even richer than they are now.  This won't do much to promote "
"musical culture or diversity."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"We can promote music more effectively by making any one musician's share of "
"the tax revenues taper off as copies increase.  For example, we could "
"calculate an &ldquo;adjusted number of copies&rdquo; which, beyond a certain "
"point, increases more slowly than the actual number."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"The effect of tapering off will be to spread the money more widely, "

"dislike the work, and sometimes because hardly anyone particularly likes "
"it.  Spreading out DAT tax revenues will also have the effect of supporting "
"less popular musicians.  However, it will not support musicians whose work "
"nobody likes.  In addition, since it involves no discretion, no arbitrary "

msgid ""
"The record company proposal includes a requirement to make it difficult for "
"home listeners to make copies.  Specifically, it requires that consumer DAT "
"machines refuse to copy a copy that was made on a consumer DAT machine.  The "
"argument for this requirement is based on the assumption that home copying "
"is somehow unfair."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"In the past, many people have considered it unfair, because it reduced the "
"income of musicians.  The DAT tax makes this reason obsolete.  Once home "
"copying does contribute to the income of musicians, through the DAT tax, the "
"reason to discourage home copying disappears."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Therefore, if a DAT tax is adopted, the ability to copy DAT tapes should not "
"be restricted.  Home copying is more efficient than record companies and "

msgid "Measuring the use of each piece of music"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Today, nearly all the recorded music in the United States is purchased in "
"record stores; home copying is but a small fraction.  This will probably "
"remain true for a long time, because record stores offer a place where a "
"person can go to find a particular piece or to browse a wide selection.  "
"While this remains true, we can usually estimate the audience of a given "
"piece fairly well by counting record sales."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Eventually, home copying may become so widespread that estimating its extent "
"from sales figures may be unsatisfactory.  This is already unsatisfactory "
"for musicians who distribute independently without the help of record "
"companies; and if any musicians need additional support, these are the "
"ones.  We need another way to estimate usage of any given piece, in order to "
"distribute the tax funds."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"We can make these estimates by survey.  From time to time, survey staff "
"would ask randomly chosen members of the public to show what copies they "
"have made of copyrighted music.  The citizens asked would not be required to "
"answer.  But no penalty and no guilt would attach to having made copies, so "
"most people will be glad to participate.  Fans will hope to be chosen so "
"that they can contribute to the count for their favorite musical groups."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"To make the survey more efficient and broader-based (and thus more "
"accurate), it could be automated.  The survey bureau could mail read-write "
"memory cards to the chosen participants, who would connect them momentarily "
"to their DAT units and then mail them back.  With proper design, the survey "
"bureau would have no way of knowing who had sent in any particular card, and "
"thus no information about who had copied what, but they would still have an "
