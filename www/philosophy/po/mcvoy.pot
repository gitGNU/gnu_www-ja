"For the first time in my life, I want to thank Larry McVoy.  He recently "
"eliminated a major weakness of the free software community, by announcing "
"the end of his campaign to entice free software projects to use and promote "
"his nonfree software.  Soon, Linux development will no longer use this "
"program, and no longer spread the message that nonfree software is a good "
"thing if it's convenient."

"My gratitude is limited, since it was McVoy that created the problem in the "
"first place.  But I still appreciate his decision to clear it up."

"There are thousands of nonfree programs, and most merit no special "
"attention, other than developing a free replacement.  What made this "
"program, BitKeeper, infamous and dangerous was its marketing approach: "
"inviting high-profile free software projects to use it, so as to attract "
"other paying users."

"McVoy made the program available gratis to free software developers.  This "
"did not mean it was free software for them: they were privileged not to part "
"with their money, but they still had to part with their freedom.  They gave "
"up the fundamental freedoms that define free software: freedom to run the "
"program as you wish for any purpose, freedom to study and change the source "
"code as you wish, freedom to make and redistribute copies, and freedom to "
"publish modified versions."

"The free software movement has said, &ldquo;Think of &lsquo;free "
"speech,&rsquo; not &lsquo;free beer&rsquo;&rdquo; since 1990.  McVoy said "
"the opposite; he invited developers to focus on the lack of monetary price, "
"instead of on freedom.  A free software activist would dismiss this "
"suggestion, but those in our community who value technical advantage above "
"freedom and community were susceptible to it."

"McVoy's great triumph was the adoption of this program for Linux "
"development.  No free software project is more visible than Linux.  It is "
"the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system, an essential component, and "
"users often mistake it for the entire system.  As McVoy surely planned, the "
"use of his program in Linux development was powerful publicity for it."

"It was also, whether intentionally or not, a powerful political PR campaign, "
"telling the free software community that freedom-denying software is "
"acceptable as long as it's convenient.  If we had taken that attitude "
"towards Unix in 1984, where would we be today? Nowhere.  If we had accepted "
"using Unix, instead of setting out to replace it, nothing like the GNU/Linux "
"system would exist."

"Of course, the Linux developers had practical reasons for what they did.  I "
"won't argue with those reasons; they surely know what's convenient for "
"them.  But they did not count, or did not value, how this would affect their "
"freedom&mdash;or the rest of the community's efforts."

"A free kernel, even a whole free operating system, is not sufficient to use "
"your computer in freedom; we need free software for everything else, too.  "
"Free applications, free drivers, free <abbr title=\"Basic Input/Output "
"System\">BIOS</abbr>: some of those projects face large obstacles&mdash;the "
"need to reverse engineer formats or protocols or pressure companies to "
"document them, or to work around or face down patent threats, or to compete "
"with a network effect.  Success will require firmness and determination.  A "
"better kernel is desirable, to be sure, but not at the expense of weakening "
"the impetus to liberate the rest of the software world."

"When the use of his program became controversial, McVoy responded with "
"distraction.  For instance, he promised to release it as free software if "
"the company went out of business.  Alas, that does no good as long as the "
"company remains in business.  Linux developers responded by saying, "
"&ldquo;We'll switch to a free program when you develop a better one.&rdquo; "
"This was an indirect way of saying, &ldquo;We made the mess, but we won't "
"clean it up.&rdquo;"

"Fortunately, not everyone in Linux development considered a nonfree program "
"acceptable, and there was continuing pressure for a free alternative.  "
"Finally Andrew Tridgell developed an interoperating free program, so Linux "
"developers would no longer need to use a nonfree program."

"McVoy first blustered and threatened, but ultimately chose to go home and "
"take his ball with him: he withdrew permission for gratis use by free "
"software projects, and Linux developers will move to other software.  The "
"program they no longer use will remain unethical as long as it is nonfree, "
"but they will no longer promote it, nor by using it teach others to give "
"freedom low priority.  We can begin to forget about that program."

"We should not forget the lesson we have learned from it: Nonfree programs "
"are dangerous to you and to your community.  Don't let them get a place in "
"your life."
