"I go out of my way to call nasty things by names that criticize them. I call "
"Apple's user-subjugating computers the &ldquo;iThings,&rdquo; and Amazon's "
"abusive e-reader the &ldquo;Swindle.&rdquo; Sometimes I refer to Microsoft's "
"operating system as &ldquo;Losedows&rdquo;; I referred to Microsoft's first "
"operating system as &ldquo;MS-Dog.&rdquo;[<a href=\"#f1\">1</a>] Of course, "
"I do this to vent my feelings and have fun. But this fun is more than "
"personal; it serves an important purpose. Mocking our enemies recruits the "
"power of humor into our cause."

"Twisting a name is disrespectful. If we respected the makers of these "
"products, we would use the names that they chose &hellip; and that's exactly "
"the point. These noxious products deserve our contempt, not our "
"respect. Every proprietary program subjects its users to some entity's "
"power, but nowadays most widely used ones go beyond that to spy on users, "
"restrict them and even push them around: the trend is for products to get "
"nastier. These products deserve to be wiped out. Those with DRM ought to be "
"illegal."

"When we mention them, we should show that we condemn them, and what easier "
"way than by twisting their names? If we don't do that, it is all too easy to "
"mention them and fail to present the condemnation.  When the product comes "
"up in the middle of some other topic, for instance, explaining at greater "
"length that the product is bad might seem like a long digression."

"Companies choose names for products as part of a marketing plan.  They "
"choose names they think people will be likely to repeat, then invest "
"millions of dollars in marketing campaigns to make people repeat and think "
"about those names.  Usually these marketing campaigns are intended to "
"convince people to admire the products based on their superficial "
"attractions and overlook the harm they do."

"Every time we call these products by the names the companies use, we "

"Other terminology besides product names can raise a similar issue.  For "
"instance, DRM refers to building technology products to restrict their users "
"for the benefit of someone else. This inexcusable practice deserves our "
"burning hatred until we wipe it out. Naturally, those responsible gave it a "
"name that frames the issue from their point of view: &ldquo;Digital Rights "
"Management.&rdquo; This name is the basis of a public relations campaign "
"that aims to win support from entities ranging from governments to the "
"W3C.[<a href=\"#f2\">2</a>]"

"We take the users' side, and from the users' point of view, what these "

"Once, a man in the audience at my speech claimed that the name "
"&ldquo;Digital Rights Management&rdquo; was the official name of "
"&ldquo;DRM,&rdquo; the only possible correct name, because it was the first "
"name. He argued that as a consequence it was wrong for us to say "
"&ldquo;Digital Restrictions Management.&rdquo;"

"Those who make a product or carry out a business practice typically choose a "
"name for it before we even know it exists. If their temporal precedence "
"obligated us to use their name, they would have an additional automatic "
"advantage, on top of their money, their media influence and their "
"technological position. We would have to fight them with our mouths tied "
"behind our backs."

"Some people feel a distaste for twisting names and say it sounds "
"&ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; or &ldquo;unprofessional.&rdquo; What they mean is, "
"it doesn't sound humorless and stodgy&mdash;and that's a good thing, because "
"we would not have laughter on our side if we tried to sound "
"&ldquo;professional.&rdquo; Fighting oppression is far more serious than "
"professional work, so we've got to add comic relief.  It calls for real "
"maturity, which includes some childishness, not &ldquo;acting like an "
"adult.&rdquo;"

"If you don't like our choice of name parodies, you can invent your own. The "
"more, the merrier. Of course, there are other ways to express "
"condemnation. If you want to sound &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; you can show "
"it in other ways.  They can get the point across, but they require more time "
"and effort, especially if you don't make use of mockery. Take care this does "
"not this lead you to skimp; don't let the pressure against such "
"&ldquo;digression&rdquo; push you into insufficiently criticizing the nasty "
"things you mention, because that would have the effect of legitimizing them."
