"The World Summit on the Information Society is supposed to formulate plans "
"to end the &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo; and make the internet accessible to "
"everyone on Earth.  The negotiations were completed in November, so the big "
"official meeting in Geneva last week was more of a trade show and conference "
"than a real summit meeting."

"The summit procedures were designed so that non-governmental organizations "
"(mainly those that promote human rights and equality, and work to reduce "
"poverty) could attend, see the discussions, and comment.  However, the "
"actual declaration paid little attention to the comments and recommendations "
"that these organizations made. In effect, civil society was offered the "
"chance to speak to a dead mike."

"The summit's declaration includes little that is bold or new. When it comes "
"to the question of what people will be free to <em>do</em> with the "
"internet, it responds to demands made by various governments to impose "
"restrictions on citizens of cyberspace."

"Part of the digital divide comes from artificial obstacles to the sharing of "
"information.  This includes the licenses of non-free software, and harmfully "
"restrictive copyright laws.  The Brazilian declaration sought measures to "
"promote free software, but the US delegation was firmly against it (remember "
"that the Bush campaign got money from Microsoft).  The outcome was a sort of "
"draw, with the final declaration presenting free software, open source, and "
"proprietary software as equally legitimate.  The US also insisted on "
"praising so-called &ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo;.  (That biased "
"term <a href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty\"> "
"promotes simplistic over-generalization</a>; for the sake of clear thinking "
"about the issues of copyright law, and about the very different issues of "
"patent law, that term should always be avoided.)"

"Human rights were given lip service, but the proposal for a &ldquo;right to "
"communicate&rdquo; (not merely to access information)  using the internet "
"was shot down by many of the countries.  The summit has been criticized for "
"situating its 2005 meeting in Tunisia, which is a prime example of what the "
"information society must not do.  People have been <a "
"href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2777389.stm\"> imprisoned in "
"Tunisia for using the internet to criticize the government</a>."

"Suppression of criticism has been evident here at the summit too.  A "
"counter-summit, actually a series of talks and discussions, was planned for "
"last Tuesday, but it was shut down by the Geneva police who clearly were "
"searching for an excuse to do so.  First they claimed that the landlord did "
"not approve use of the space, but the tenant who has a long-term lease for "
"the space then arrived and said he had authorized the event.  So the police "
"cited a fire code violation which I'm told is applicable to most buildings "
"in Geneva&mdash;in effect, an all-purpose excuse to shut down anything.  "
"Press coverage of this maneuver eventually forced the city to allow the "
"counter-summit to proceed on Wednesday in a different location."

"In a more minor act of suppression, the moderator of the official round "
"table in which I spoke told me &ldquo;your time is up&rdquo; well before the "
"three minutes each participant was supposed to have.  She later did the same "
"thing to the EPIC representative.  I later learned that she works for the "
"International Chamber of Commerce&mdash;no wonder she silenced us.  And how "
"telling that the summit would put a representative of the ICC at the "
"throttle when we spoke."

"Suppression was also visible in the exclusion of certain NGOs from the "
"summit because their focus on human rights might embarrass the governments "
"that trample them.  For instance, the summit <a "
"href=\"http://iso.hrichina.org/public/contents/13710\"> refused to accredit "
"Human Rights In China</a>, a group that criticizes the Chinese government "
"for (among other things) censorship of the internet."

"Reporters Without Borders was also excluded from the summit.  To raise "
"awareness of their exclusion, and of the censorship of the internet in "
"various countries, they set up an unauthorized radio station in nearby "
"France and handed out mini-radios, so that summit attendees could hear what "
"the organization had been blocked from saying at the summit itself."

"The summit may have a few useful side effects.  For instance, several people "
"came together to plan an organization to help organizations in Africa switch "
"to GNU/Linux.  But the summit did nothing to support this activity beyond "
"providing an occasion for us to meet.  Nor, I believe, was it intended to "
"support any such thing.  The overall attitude of the summit can be seen in "
"its having invited Microsoft to speak alongside, and before, most of the "
"various participating governments&mdash;as if to accord that criminal "
"corporation the standing of a state."
