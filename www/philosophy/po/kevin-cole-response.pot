"The document you have sent is not an Internet mail format.  It is a "
"proprietary format that is unreadable on several types of computers, "
"including those used by visually-impaired readers and older computers used "
"in foreign countries. In most cases, the size of the file is substantially "
"larger than a plain-text file containing the same information.  (Even if it "
"LOOKS like plain-text to you, chances are it is not, and contains a "
"considerable amount of unnecessary formatting codes, printer information, "
"etc.) In addition, Microsoft Word documents are often infected with "
"viruses.  Excel, Access, and Power Point files are also vulnerable to "
"infection."
