<h2>A Response Letter to the Word Attachments</h2>

<p>From: The Reverend Father Martin Sylvester</p>
<p>
Sorry I was unable to read your attachment.  I hope the following is
useful!
</p>
<p>
You sent me an email with an attachment in Microsoft Word format,
which is not a standard Internet format, but a proprietary one owned
by Microsoft, and protected by them so people can't be sure of reading
it properly unless they buy expensive Microsoft software.  If you had
sent me your text inside a plain email (instead of as an attachment to
an email), or as a plain text, rich text, HTML, or PDF attachment,
then I would have been able to read it.
</p>
<p>
Distributing documents in Word format is not good for you or for
others.  You can't be sure what they will look like if someone views
them with a different version of Word; some people may not be able to
read them at all.
</p>
<p>
Receiving Word attachments is not good for you because they can carry
viruses: see
<a href="http://www.viruslist.com/en/virusesdescribed?chapter=153313603">
http://www.viruslist.com/en/virusesdescribed?chapter=153313603</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sending Word attachments is not good for you, because a Word document
normally includes hidden information about the author, enabling those
with the know-how to pry into the life of the person who wrote it.
Text that you think you deleted may still be embarrassingly present in
the file, but simply hidden from you when you view it using Word.  The
person who reads your Word document with a different program might be
able to see it all.  Your attachments might even contain fragments of
documents you were working on prior to sending your email, in text
that's invisible to you, but visible to some of the people who receive
your Word attachments.  See
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3154479.stm">
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3154479.stm</a> for more
information.
</p>
<p>
If someone is using a slow connection, or reading their email through
their mobile (cellphone) or their handheld computer, your message
might not be accessible to them at all if you send it as a Word
attachment; if it is, it will take many, many times longer for them to
download than if you send a plain email, and this could be very
expensive for them on a wireless connection.
</p>
<p>
Worse still, sending people Word documents is a discourtesy because it
implies that if they don't own the programs that you use, you're not
interested in whether or not they can read what you've written.
Imagine sending a document in Latin to someone else without knowing
whether or not they read Latin!  If you send someone a Word document,
the only way they can be sure of reading it properly is to go out and
buy Microsoft Word.  Not everyone can afford to do this, and millions
of individuals and organizations use other word processing programs
because they prefer them, or because they're cheaper or even free.
</p>
<p>
Even some people who do own Word don't like to receive Word
attachments because they don't want to get viruses.
</p>
<p>
I hope it's clear that I'm not in any way trying to tell you off, but
just to share with you some information that you might not have had an
opportunity to consider, and which might be helpful to you.
</p>
<p>
In case you do choose to reconsider using Word attachments as a method
of communication, here's some information about ways of sending emails
and attachments that anyone can read.
</p>
<p>
If what's important in your email is the words, it's always, always
best to send it as a plain text email.  This won't allow you to use
italics or underlining, but will be readable on any email program on
any device anywhere in the world.  To do this type your message right
into a blank email in your email program, and check that it will be
sent as a plain text mail (not HTML or RTF) &mdash; the
&lsquo;Help&rsquo; function of your email program should explain how
you can set it up to send plain text emails.  There are accepted
conventions for emphasizing words or distinguishing titles of books.
Emphasize words like this: it's *very* easy.  Cite references like
this: Joseph Heller, _Catch 22_.
</p>
<p>
Another way that might work is to compose your message in Word, then
select and copy all of it.  Open your email program and create a new
email, and paste the text into the area where you would type your
message.  This is not entirely reliable, since different versions of
Word work slightly differently, and it might add a whole load of
invisible formatting codes to your email (invisible to you, using
Word: a lengthy jumble of meaningless characters to someone who tries
to read it using something else).
</p>
<p>
If you have a very long document you want to send as an attachment, or
a document which people won't be able to understand by means of the
words alone (perhaps you have complicated formulae or tables in it, or
you *must* use bold and italic), then there are still ways of doing
this without appearing to show contempt for people who don't own
Microsoft Word.
</p>
<p>
To convert the file to HTML using Word is simple. Open the document,
click on File, then Save As, and in the Save As Type strip box at the
bottom of the box, choose HTML Document or Web Page.  Then choose
Save.  You can then attach the new HTML document instead of your Word
document.  Note that Word changes in inconsistent ways &mdash; if you
see slightly different menu item names, please try them.
</p>
<p>
To convert to plain text (or RTF, rich text) is almost the same
&mdash; instead of HTML Document, choose Text Only or Text Document
(or RTF or Rich text Format) as the Save As Type.
</p>
<p>
Your computer may also have a program to convert to the PDF (or Adobe
Acrobat) format, which was designed to make sure that when someone
else views your document, it looks exactly the same on their computer
as it did on yours.  Select File => Print.  Scroll through available
printers and select the pdf converter.  Click on the Print button and
enter a name for the pdf file when requested, then attach that file to
your email.  There are some cheap or even free programs to make PDF
files: use the search function at
<a href="http://www.download.com/">http://www.download.com/</a> or
<a href="http://www.tucows.com/">http://www.tucows.com/</a>
to find them.
</p>
<p>
I hope I haven't offended you by offering you this advice.  It can be
a bit alarming to learn that the way we've been communicating has
implied disrespect to some of the people who receive our
communications. I thought &mdash; I hope I'm right &mdash; that you'd
prefer to be told about it.
