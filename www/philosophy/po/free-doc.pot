"The biggest deficiency in free operating systems is not in the "
"software&mdash;it is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in "
"these systems.  Many of our most important programs do not come with full "
"manuals.  Documentation is an essential part of any software package; when "
"an important free software package does not come with a free manual, that is "
"a major gap.  We have many such gaps today."

"Once upon a time, many years ago, I thought I would learn Perl.  I got a "
"copy of a free manual, but I found it hard to read.  When I asked Perl users "
"about alternatives, they told me that there were better introductory "
"manuals&mdash;but those were not free."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Why was this? The authors of the good manuals had written them for O'Reilly "
"Associates, which published them with restrictive terms&mdash;no copying, no "
"modification, source files not available&mdash;which exclude them from the "
"free software community."

"That wasn't the first time this sort of thing has happened, and (to our "
"community's great loss) it was far from the last.  Proprietary manual "
"publishers have enticed a great many authors to restrict their manuals since "
"then.  Many times I have heard a GNU user eagerly tell me about a manual "
"that he is writing, with which he expects to help the GNU Project&mdash;and "
"then had my hopes dashed, as he proceeded to explain that he had signed a "
"contract with a publisher that would restrict it so that we cannot use it."

"Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not price.  "
"The problem with these manuals was not that O'Reilly Associates charged a "
"price for printed copies&mdash;that in itself is fine.  (The Free Software "
"Foundation <a href=\"http://shop.fsf.org/category/books/\">sells printed "
"copies</a> of free <a href=\"/doc/doc.html\">GNU manuals</a>, too.)  But GNU "
"manuals are available in source code form, while these manuals are available "
"only on paper.  GNU manuals come with permission to copy and modify; the "
"Perl manuals do not.  These restrictions are the problems."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free "
"software: it is a matter of giving all users certain freedoms.  "
"Redistribution (including commercial redistribution) must be permitted, so "
"that the manual can accompany every copy of the program, on line or on "
"paper.  Permission for modification is crucial too."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"As a general rule, I don't believe that it is essential for people to have "
"permission to modify all sorts of articles and books.  The issues for "
"writings are not necessarily the same as those for software.  For example, I "
"don't think you or I are obliged to give permission to modify articles like "
"this one, which describe our actions and our views."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial for "
"documentation for free software.  When people exercise their right to modify "
"the software, and add or change its features, if they are conscientious they "
"will change the manual too&mdash;so they can provide accurate and usable "
"documentation with the modified program.  A manual which forbids programmers "
"from being conscientious and finishing the job, or more precisely requires "
"them to write a new manual from scratch if they change the program, does not "
"fill our community's needs."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"While a blanket prohibition on modification is unacceptable, some kinds of "
"limits on the method of modification pose no problem.  For example, "
"requirements to preserve the original author's copyright notice, the "
"distribution terms, or the list of authors, are OK.  It is also no problem "
"to require modified versions to include notice that they were modified, even "
"to have entire sections that may not be deleted or changed, as long as these "
"sections deal with nontechnical topics.  (Some GNU manuals have them.)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"These kinds of restrictions are not a problem because, as a practical "
"matter, they don't stop the conscientious programmer from adapting the "
"manual to fit the modified program.  In other words, they don't block the "
"free software community from making full use of the manual."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"However, it must be possible to modify all the <em>technical</em> content of "
"the manual, and then distribute the result through all the usual media, "
"through all the usual channels; otherwise, the restrictions do block the "
"community, the manual is not free, and so we need another manual."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Unfortunately, it is often hard to find someone to write another manual when "
"a proprietary manual exists.  The obstacle is that many users think that a "
"proprietary manual is good enough&mdash;so they don't see the need to write "
"a free manual.  They do not see that the free operating system has a gap "
"that needs filling."

"Why do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough? Some have not "

"Other users consider proprietary manuals acceptable for the same reason so "
"many people consider proprietary software acceptable: they judge in purely "
"practical terms, not using freedom as a criterion.  These people are "
"entitled to their opinions, but since those opinions spring from values "
"which do not include freedom, they are no guide for those of us who do value "
"freedom."

"Please spread the word about this issue.  We continue to lose manuals to "
"proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that proprietary manuals are "
"not sufficient, perhaps the next person who wants to help GNU by writing "
"documentation will realize, before it is too late, that he must above all "
"make it free."

"We can also encourage commercial publishers to sell free, copylefted manuals "
"instead of proprietary ones.  One way you can help this is to check the "
"distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and prefer copylefted "
