"Free software is a matter of freedom.  From our point of view, precisely "
"which legal mechanism is used to deny software users their freedom is just "
"an implemementation detail.  Whether it is done with copyright, with "
"contracts, or in some other way, it is wrong to deny the public the freedoms "
"necessary to form a community and cooperate.  This is why it is inaccurate "
"to understand the Free Software Movement as specifically a matter of "
"opposition to copyright on software.  It is both more and less than that."

"However, you will often hear people of right-wing ideological persuasion "
"argue in vague way that some general moral principle of property rights "
"compels us to cede our freedom to a system of copyright, regardless of how "
"this affects our way of life.  The right-wing Libertarian counterargument, "
"coming as it does from a group that regards property rights as the highest "
"moral principle, is useful as a refutation.  It shows that even if you adore "
"property rights for physical objects, you are not compelled to accept "
"copyright."
