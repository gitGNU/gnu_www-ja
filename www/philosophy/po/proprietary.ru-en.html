<h2>Proprietary Software</h2>

<p>Proprietary software, nonfree software, is software that doesn't
respect users' freedom and community.  The developer or owner has
power over its users.  That in itself is an injustice, but it often
leads to further injustice.</p>

<p>Power corrupts, so the program's owner is tempted to put malicious
functionality into the program &mdash; that is, to make
it <em>malware</em>.  Malware means software whose functioning
mistreats the user.  This page gives examples of widely used
proprietary programs that are known to be malware.</p>

    doors</a></li>
<li><a href="/philosophy/proprietary-insecurity.html">Proprietary
    insecurity</a></li>
<li><a href="/philosophy/proprietary-sabotage.html">Proprietary
    sabotage</a></li>
<li><a href="/philosophy/proprietary-surveillance.html">Proprietary
    surveillance</a></li>
<li><a href="/philosophy/proprietary-jails.html">Jails</a> &mdash; systems
    that impose censorship on application programs.</li>
<li><a href="/philosophy/proprietary-tyrants.html">Tyrants</a> &mdash; systems
    that reject any operating system not &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; by
    the manufacturer.</li>
<li><a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org/">Digital Restrictions
    Management</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The way to avoid these forms of abuse is by insisting on
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">free
(freedom-respecting) software.</a>  Since free software is controlled
by its users, they have a pretty good defense against malicious
software functionality.  Users of proprietary software are
defenseless.</p>
