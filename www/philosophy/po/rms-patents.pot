"So, why are software patents bad? Or, &ldquo;computational idea "
"patents&rdquo; as I think we should really call them, because each one is a "
"monopoly on a computational idea.  Most people, when you say &ldquo;software "
"patents,&rdquo; they think it's a question of patenting a specific program.  "
"I'm sure all of you know that that's not what those patents do, but most "
"people don't know that, so, to try to avoid misleading people, I call them "
"&ldquo;computational idea patents.&rdquo;"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"So, anyway, the reason these are bad is that they deny people the freedom to "
"use their computers as they wish and do their computing as they wish, "
"freedom that everyone must have.  These patents put all software developers "
"in danger, and their users as well.  A danger that there is no reason we "
"should stand for.  So: we should protect software from patents.  Software "
"needs patent protection: protection from patents."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"But most people don't know enough about what patents do to appreciate why "
"patents that can restrict software are so harmful.  Most people think that "
"patents are like copyrights, which is not true at all.  The sum total of "
"what they have in common is one sentence in the Constitution, and that "
"similarity is so little and abstract it has nothing to do with the practical "
"effects."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"So, the last thing we should ever do is use the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo; that confuses not just these two laws, but a bunch of other "
"unrelated, disparate laws, that don't even share one sentence in the "
"Constitution with those two.  So that term spreads confusion whenever it's "
"used and about eight years ago I decided I should never use it and I have "
"never used it since then.  It's surprisingly easy to avoid, because in "
"general there's no reason whatsoever to use it except that it's chic.  And "
"once you learn to resist that, it's as easy as pie, just talk about one law, "
"and then you call that law by its name, and you're making a coherent, clear "
"statement."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"So, I have to explain to people what patents do, and show them that it's not "
"at all like what copyrights do.  An analogy is a good way to do this.  What "
"can you say about programs? Well, they're large works, full of details that "
"all have to work together to get the desired result.  Well, what else is "
"there like that? A novel, or a symphony.  So, imagine if the governments of "
"Europe in the 1700s had had the cockeyed idea of promoting the progress of "
"symphonic music with a system of &ldquo;musical idea patents.&rdquo; So, any "
"musical idea statable in words could have been patented.  A melodic motif "
"could have been patented, or a series of chords, or a rhythmic pattern, or a "
"pattern of repetitions in a movement, or the use of certain instruments "
"while the rest of the orchestra is silent and a bunch of other musical ideas "
"that I can't think of, but maybe a composer would."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"So, now imagine it's 1800 and you're Beethoven and you want to write a "
"symphony.  You're going to find that it's harder to write a symphony that "
"you don't get sued for than to write a good symphony.  Now, you'd probably "
"have complained, and the patent holders would have said &ldquo;Oh, "
"Beethoven, you're just jealous because we had these ideas before you.  Why "
"don't you go think of some ideas of your own?&rdquo; Of course, Beethoven is "
"considered a great composer because he had lots of new ideas, and not only "
"that, he knew how to use them effectively.  And that is: combined with lots "
"of familiar ideas, so that his pieces were merely shocking for a while, but "
"people could get used to them.  They were not so alien and incomprehensible "
"that they got rejected.  They shocked people for a while, people got used to "
"them, and now we don't see what's shocking any more, because we're used to "
"those ideas.  Well, that's the proof that he used those ideas well."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"So, the idea that anyone could, or should have to, reinvent music from zero, "
"is absurd.  Not even a Beethoven could do that, and it would be silly to ask "
"someone to try.  It's the same with computing.  Just as a symphony "
"implements many musical ideas together, but the hard part is not picking a "
"bunch of ideas.  The hard part is implementing them together with notes.  "
"It's the same with software.  A large program will implement thousands of "
"ideas together.  But the hard part is not picking some ideas.  It's easy to "
"pick some ideas.  What's hard is to implement them all together and make it "
"work well."

"So &ldquo;computational idea patents&rdquo; obstruct the hard and big job by "
"promoting resources that we get plenty of anyways.  So it's a misconceived "
"system.  Designed to give us help we don't want at the cost of tremendous "
"problems."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"So what we need is to get rid of the problem.  What is the problem? The "
"problem is: software developers and their users are threatened by patents.  "
"They are in danger.  How can you prevent that? Well, one way is: don't issue "
"patents that could affect software.  That solution works if you apply it "
"from the beginning.  If a country never issues such patents, then its patent "
"system doesn't attack software.  OK, it's a good solution.  But it's not "
"applicable if a country has already issued hundreds of thousands of software "
"patents."

"Now, I've proposed that constitutions should explicitly say that patent "
"privileges can be reduced just as they can be increased.  That they are not "
"in any sense somebody's property; they are privileges given out by the "
"government which can be changed at will.  After all, if you allow the "
"government by legislation to increase them, it's absurd to make this a "
"one-way ratchet.  But that's not in the US Constitution."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"So, what can we do? Well, we can ask courts to rule that all those patents "
"that restrict software were invalid from the beginning and always have been "
"invalid, and that gets rid of them all.  However, that's not something that "
"people can lobby for.  It's not something we can say to officials, &ldquo;do "
"this because we want you to.&rdquo;"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"So, if we're going to look for a solution that we can get implemented, what "
"is there? Well, the only way I can see is to legislate that software is a "
"safe harbor.  If it's software, then you're safe.  Circuits to do the same "
"computation would be covered by a patent, but if it's software, then you're "
"safe.  But what does that mean? What does it mean for something to be "
"software? Well, it runs on a general purpose, universal machine.  So first "
"you make a universal machine and then you put in the program to say what it "
"should do.  Well, if the machine's only function is to be universal, then "
"the program is all that implements any specific, patented idea."

"So, that's the case I want to get at, and I'm trying to separate it from a "
"case like that in <cite>Diamond vs. Diehr</cite> where there was a patent "
"for a system, a method of curing rubber.  The implementation involved a "
"computer, but it also involved special purpose hardware, not a general "
"purpose universal machine, and that special purpose hardware was crucial to "
"carrying out the patented technique.  It wasn't actually a software "
"technique.  And, actually, I read an article by Pamela Samuelson arguing "
"that the CAFC twisted that decision and basically got the quantifiers in the "
"wrong order.  That the Supreme Court said, &ldquo;the fact that there's a "
"computer in there somewhere doesn't automatically make it "
"non-patentable,&rdquo; and the CAFC twisted that into &ldquo;the computer "
"makes it patentable.&rdquo;"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Anyway, we might have some hope with the courts, but I'm proposing a method "
"that will separate the cases that we must protect from non-computational "
"idea patents that affect systems that might be implemented with a computer "
"in there somewhere.  The precise words to use? Well, the best I could come "
"up with was: &ldquo;software running on generally used computing "
"hardware.&rdquo; We certainly want things like smartphones to be covered; we "
"don't want it to exclude anything that has any kind of special-purpose "
"hardware in there.  The portable phone obviously has specialised hardware to "
"talk to the phone network, but that shouldn't automatically mean that if "
"it's running on a portable phone, it's vulnerable to patents.  Because that "
"is a general purpose computer and people use it for all sorts of things.  "
"But my words, &ldquo;generally used computing hardware,&rdquo; they may not "
"be the best possible words.  This is a subject that I think calls for study, "
"because we've got to look at each possible wording that might be used and "
"see which cases would be protected from patents and which would be exposed "
"to come up with the right method."

"Now, every time I suggest a method to solve this problem, the first thing "
"people try to look for is how to half solve it instead.  The idea of really "
"solving the problem shocks people because it strikes them as radical.  They "
"think &ldquo;I can't advocate something so radical as to really solve this "
"whole problem.  I've got to look for some partial solution that will only "
"protect some software developers.&rdquo; Well, that's a mistake.  It's a "
"mistake a) because it wouldn't do the whole job, but b) because it would be "
"harder to get it passed.  There are lots of software developers and they are "
"all threatened and if we propose to protect them all, they will all have a "
"reason to support it.  But if we propose to only protect some of them, the "
"rest will say &ldquo;well, this doesn't do me any good, why should I "
"care?&rdquo;"

#. type: Content of: <p>

"So, let's propose a real solution.  And, besides, partial solutions tend to "
"be vulnerable to the problem that Boldrin and Levine have written about very "
"effectively, that it's easy for the pressures for patents to stretch the "
"boundaries if you give them any kind of boundary that they can stretch.  And "
"this, by the way, is another advantage of applying a change to suing people, "
"rather than to what's patentable.  Because there, the criteria are just "
"&ldquo;what kind of situation is this?&rdquo; It's harder to stretch those, "
"and if they tried, it would always be in a case against somebody who's going "
"to be fighting not to stretch it.  So it's less vulnerable to being "
"distorted from an intended restriction of substance into an actual "
"requirement of form of patent applications, which tends to happen to any "
"kind of requirement about what patent applications have to look like."
