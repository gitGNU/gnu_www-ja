"I couldn't do that with most commercial e-books. It's &ldquo;not "

"malicious features called Digital Restrictions Management (DRM, for short) "
"to restrict reading, so it simply won't work. The e-books are encrypted so "

"Many other habits that we readers are accustomed to are &ldquo;not "
"allowed&rdquo; for e-books. With the Amazon &ldquo;Kindle&rdquo; (for which "
"<a "
"href=\"/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html\">&ldquo;Swindle&rdquo;</a> "
"is a more fitting name), to take one example, users can't buy a book "
"anonymously with cash. &ldquo;Kindle&rdquo; books are typically available "
"from Amazon only, and Amazon makes users identify themselves. Thus, Amazon "
"knows exactly which books each user has read. In a country such as the UK, "
"where you can be <a "
"href=\"http://www.stallman.org/archives/2012-mar-jun.html#07_April_2012_%28Wrong_book%29\">prosecuted "

"Furthermore, you can't sell the e-book after you read it (if Amazon has its "
"way, the used book stores where I have passed many an afternoon will be "
"history). You can't give it to a friend either, because according to Amazon "
"you never really owned it. Amazon requires users to sign an End-User License "

"You can't even be sure it will still be in your machine tomorrow.  People "
"reading 1984 in the &ldquo;Kindle&rdquo; had an Orwellian experience: their "
"e-books vanished right before their eyes, as Amazon used a malicious "
"software feature called a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; to remotely delete them "
"(virtual book-burning; is that what &ldquo;Kindle&rdquo; means?). But don't "
"worry; Amazon promised never to do this again, except by order of the state."

"With software, either the users control the program (making such software <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">Libre or Free</a>)  or the program "
"controls its users (non-Libre). Amazon's e-book policies imitate the "
"distribution policies of non-Libre software, but that's not the only "
"relationship between the two. The <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/proprietary/proprietary.html\">malicious software "
"features</a> described above are imposed on users via software that's not "
"Libre. If a Libre program had malicious features like those, some users "
"skilled at programming would remove them, then provide the corrected version "
"to all the other users. Users can't change non-Libre software, which makes "
"it <a "

"What worries me most is the prospect of losing the option of printed "
"books. The Guardian has announced &ldquo;digital-only reads&rdquo;: in other "
"words, books available only at the price of freedom. I will not read any "
"book at that price. Five years from now, will unauthorized copies be the "
"only ethically acceptable copies for most books?"

"It doesn't have to be that way. With anonymous payment on the Internet, "
"paying for downloads of non-DRM non-EULA e-books would respect our "
"freedom. Physical stores could sell such e-books for cash, like digital "
"music on CDs&mdash;still available even though the music industry is "
"aggressively pushing DRM-restrictive services such as Spotify. Physical CD "
"stores face the burden of an expensive inventory, but physical e-book stores "
"could write copies onto your USB memory stick, the only inventory being "
"memory sticks to sell if you need."

"The reason publishers give for their restrictive e-books practices is to "
"stop people from sharing copies. They say this is for the sake of the "
"authors; but even if it did serve the authors' interests (which for quite "
"famous authors it may), it could not justify DRM, EULAs or the Digital "
"Economy Act which persecutes readers for sharing.  In practice, the "
"copyright system does a bad job of supporting authors aside from the most "
"popular ones. Other authors' principal interest is to be better known, so "
"sharing their work benefits them as well as readers. Why not switch to a "
"system that does the job better and is compatible with sharing?"

"A tax on memories and Internet connectivity, along the general lines of what "
"most EU countries do, could do the job well if three points are got "
"right. The money should be collected by the state and distributed according "
"to law, not given to a private collecting society; it should be divided "
"among all authors, and we mustnâ€™t let companies take any of it from them; "
"and the distribution of money should be based on a sliding scale, not in "
"linear proportion to popularity. I suggest using the cube root of each "
"author's popularity: if A is eight times as popular as B, A gets twice B's "
"amount (not eight times B's amount). This would support many fairly popular "
"writers adequately instead of making a few stars richer."

"Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy. (I mean "
"non-commercial redistribution of exact copies.) So sharing ought to be "
"legal, and preventing sharing is no excuse to make e-books into handcuffs "
"for readers. If e-books mean that readers' freedom must either increase or "
"decrease, we must demand the increase."
