"The United States Postal Service has submitted a rule to Congress proposing "
"that all Commercial Mail Recieving Agencies (CMRAs) must, as of June 24, "
"1999, collect significant personal information from all clients using their "
"services. This would certainly affect anonymous mail transactions, and could "
"put millions of CMRA customers in danger.  Any CMRA or CMRA customer who "
"refuses to comply with this regulation would effectively lose their right to "
"recieve mail."

"The proposed regulation (published in the Federal Register on March 25, "
"1999) requires that CMRAs collect names, home addresses, telephone numbers, "
"and photo ID information about each customer.  If the CMRA customer "
"classifies themselves as a business, they must surrender the information on "
"that box holder to anyone who asks for it.  CMRAs are widely used by "
"survivors of domestic violence, undercover law enforcement officials, and "
"stalking victims in order to conceal their locations and identities from "
"people who could cause them harm."

"The USPS proposal was intended to help cut down on mail fraud, a practice "
"that costs consumers millions of dollars every year.  However, experts state "
"that the Postal Service's proposal will not serve as a deterrent to "
"criminals.  &ldquo;It will be a simple process for those with financial "
"means to rent homes, apartments, office space, or the executive suites "
"available in most major metropolitan areas&rdquo;, says Postal Watch's "
"website."

"Congressman Ron Paul has introduced House Joint Resolution 55, which would "
