"The League is a grass-roots organization of professors, students, business "
"people, programmers, users, and even software companies dedicated to "
"bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League isn't opposed to "
"the legal system that Congress intended&mdash;copyright on individual "
"programs.  The League aims to reverse recent changes made by judges in "
"response to special interests."

"<strong>The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation, and "
"is not concerned with the issue of free software.</strong> The FSF supports "
"the League because, like any software developer smaller than Microsoft, it "
"is endangered by software patents, and interface copyrights.  You are in "
"danger, too! It would be easy to ignore the problem until you or your "
"employer is sued, but it is more prudent to organize before that happens."
