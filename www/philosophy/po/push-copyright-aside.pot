"<em>Many points that lead to a conclusion that software freedom must be "
"universal often apply to other forms of expressive works, albeit in "
"different ways. This essay concerns the application of principles related to "
"software freedom to the area of literature.  Generally, such issues are "
"orthogonal to software freedom, but we include essays like this here since "
"many people interested in Free Software want to know more about how the "
"principles can be applied to areas other than software.</em>"

"It should be a truism that the scientific literature exists to disseminate "
"scientific knowledge, and that scientific journals exist to facilitate the "
"process.  It therefore follows that rules for use of the scientific "
"literature should be designed to help achieve that goal."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"The rules we have now, known as copyright, were established in the age of "
"the printing press, an inherently centralized method of mass-production "
"copying.  In a print environment, copyright on journal articles restricted "
"only journal publishers&mdash;requiring them to obtain permission to publish "
"an article&mdash;and would-be plagiarists. It helped journals to operate and "
"disseminate knowledge, without interfering with the useful work of "
"scientists or students, either as writers or readers of articles. These "
"rules fit that system well."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The modern technology for scientific publishing, however, is the World Wide "
"Web.  What rules would best ensure the maximum dissemination of scientific "
"articles, and knowledge, on the web? Articles should be distributed in "
"nonproprietary formats, with open access for all. And everyone should have "
"the right to &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; articles&mdash;that is, to republish them "
"verbatim with proper attribution."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"These rules should apply to past as well as future articles, when they are "
"distributed in electronic form. But there is no crucial need to change the "
"present copyright system as it applies to paper publication of journals "
"because the problem is not in that domain."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, it seems that not everyone agrees with the truisms that began "
"this article. Many journal publishers appear to believe that the purpose of "
"scientific literature is to enable them to publish journals so as to collect "
"subscriptions from scientists and students. Such thinking is known as "
"&ldquo;confusion of the means with the ends&rdquo;."
msgstr ""

"Their approach has been to restrict access even to read the scientific "
"literature to those who can and will pay for it. They use copyright law, "
"which is still in force despite its inappropriateness for computer networks, "
"as an excuse to stop scientists from choosing new rules."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"For the sake of scientific cooperation and humanity's future, we must reject "
"that approach at its root&mdash;not merely the obstructive systems that have "
"been instituted, but the mistaken priorities that inspired them."

"Journal publishers sometimes claim that online access requires expensive "
"high-powered server machines, and that they must charge access fees to pay "
"for these servers. This &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is a consequence of its own "
"&ldquo;solution.&rdquo; Give everyone the freedom to mirror, and libraries "
"around the world will set up mirror sites to meet the demand. This "
"decentralized solution will reduce network bandwidth needs and provide "
"faster access, all the while protecting the scholarly record against "
"accidental loss."

"Publishers also argue that paying the editors requires charging for access.  "
"Let us accept the assumption that editors must be paid; this tail need not "
"wag the dog. The cost of editing for a typical paper is between 1 percent "
"and 3 percent of the cost of funding the research to produce it. Such a "
"small percentage of the cost can hardly justify obstructing the use of the "
"results."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Instead, the cost of editing could be recovered, for example, through page "
"charges to the authors, who can pass these on to the research sponsors.  The "
"sponsors should not mind, given that they currently pay for publication in a "
"more cumbersome way, through overhead fees for the university library's "
"subscription to the journal. By changing the economic model to charge "
"editing costs to the research sponsors, we can eliminate the apparent need "
"to restrict access. The occasional author who is not affiliated with an "
"institution or company, and who has no research sponsor, could be exempted "
"from page charges, with costs levied on institution-based authors."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Another justification for access fees to online publications is to fund "
"conversion of the print archives of a journal into online form. That work "
"needs to be done, but we should seek alternative ways of funding it that do "
"not involve obstructing access to the result. The work itself will not be "
"any more difficult, or cost any more. It is self-defeating to digitize the "
"archives and waste the results by restricting access."

"The US government has imposed a requirement known as \"public access\" on "

"Curiously, the concept of \"open access\" in the 2002 Budapest Open Access "
