"With the Microsoft antitrust trial moving toward a conclusion, the question "
"of what to demand of Microsoft if it loses is coming to the fore.  Ralph "
"Nader is even [when this was written, in March 1999] organizing a conference "
"about the question (see <a "
"href=\"http://www.appraising-microsoft.org/\">http://www.appraising-microsoft.org/</a>)."

"The obvious answers&mdash;to restrict contracts between Microsoft and "
"computer manufacturers, or to break up the company&mdash;will not make a "
"crucial difference.  The former might encourage the availability of "
"computers with the GNU/Linux system preinstalled, but that is happening "
"anyway.  The latter would mainly help other proprietary application "
"developers compete, which would only offer users alternative ways to let go "
"of their freedom."

"So I propose three remedies that would help enable <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a> operating systems such "
"as GNU/Linux compete technically while respecting users' freedom.  These "
"three remedies directly address the three biggest obstacles to development "
"of free operating systems, and to giving them the capability of running "
"programs written for Windows.  They also directly address the methods "
"Microsoft has said (in the &ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo;) it will use to "
"obstruct free software.  It would be most effective to use all three of "
"these remedies together."

"Require Microsoft to publish complete documentation of all interfaces "
"between software components, all communications protocols, and all file "
"formats.  This would block one of Microsoft's favorite tactics: secret and "
"incompatible interfaces."

"To make this requirement really stick, Microsoft should not be allowed to "
"use a nondisclosure agreement with some other organization to excuse "
"implementing a secret interface.  The rule must be: if they cannot publish "
"the interface, they cannot release an implementation of it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li><p>
msgid ""
"It would, however, be acceptable to permit Microsoft to begin implementation "
"of an interface before the publication of the interface specifications, "
"provided that they release the specifications simultaneously with the "
"implementation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li><p>
msgid ""
"Enforcement of this requirement would not be difficult.  If other software "
"developers complain that the published documentation fails to describe some "
"aspect of the interface, or how to do a certain job, the court would direct "
"Microsoft to answer questions about it.  Any questions about interfaces (as "
"distinguished from implementation techniques) would have to be answered."

"Similar terms were included in an agreement between IBM and the European "
"Community in 1984, settling another antitrust dispute.  See <a "

"Require Microsoft to use its patents for defense only, in the field of "
"software.  (If they happen to own patents that apply to other fields, those "
"other fields could be included in this requirement, or they could be "
"exempt.)  This would block the other tactic Microsoft mentioned in the "
"Halloween documents: using patents to block development of free software."

"We should give Microsoft the option of using either self-defense or mutual "
"defense.  Self defense means offering to cross-license all patents at no "
"charge with anyone who wishes to do so.  Mutual defense means licensing all "
"patents to a pool which anyone can join&mdash;even people who have no "
"patents of their own.  The pool would license all members' patents to all "
"members."

"It is crucial to address the issue of patents, because it does no good to "
"have Microsoft publish an interface, if they have managed to work some "
"patented wrinkle into it (or into the functionality it gives access to), "
"such that the rest of us are not allowed to implement it."

"Require Microsoft not to certify any hardware as working with Microsoft "
"software, unless the hardware's complete specifications have been published, "
"so that any programmer can implement software to support the same hardware."

"Secret hardware specifications are not in general Microsoft's doing, but "
"they are a significant obstacle for the development of the free operating "
"systems that can provide competition for Windows.  To remove this obstacle "
"would be a great help.  If a settlement is negotiated with Microsoft, "
"including this sort of provision in it is not impossible&mdash;it would be a "
"matter of negotiation."

"This April, Microsoft's Ballmer announced a possible plan to release source "
"code for some part of Windows.  It is not clear whether that would imply "
"making it free software, or which part of Windows it might be.  But if "
"Microsoft does make some important part of Windows free software, it could "
"solve these problems as regards that part.  (It could also be a contribution "
"to the free software community, if the software in question could be useful "
"for purposes other than running other proprietary Microsoft software.)"

"However, having the use as free software of a part of Windows is less "
"crucial than being <em>permitted</em> to implement all parts.  The remedies "
"proposed above are what we really need.  They will clear the way for us to "
"develop a truly superior alternative to Microsoft Windows, in whatever area "
"Microsoft does not make Windows free software."
