<h2>Proprietary Sabotage</h2>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary software that does nasty things
beyond spying on users and restricting them.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>Oracle's nonfree Java plug-in for browsers <a
href="http://www.zdnet.com/a-close-look-at-how-oracle-installs-deceptive-software-with-java-updates-7000010038/?s_cid=e539">
sneakily installs other annoying proprietary software</a>.</p>

<p>That article disregards all other bad things about proprietary
software.  For instance, it regards the inclusion of proprietary Flash
Player (which has a <a
href="http://www.imasuper.com/66/technology/flash-cookies-the-silent-privacy-killer/">
surveillance feature </a> and DRM) in Chrome as a good thing.  Chrome
is a proprietary browser with a universal back door.</p>

<p>We don't agree with the article's views on those issues, but we
present it as a factual reference.</p>
</li>
