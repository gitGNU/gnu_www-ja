<h2>Viral Code and Vaccination</h2>

<p>by <a href="http://www.rattlesnake.com/"><strong>Robert
J. Chassell</strong></a></p>

<p>When others hurt me, I try to defend myself.  But some tell me that
this makes them sick.  They tell me that I should permit people to rob
me of my work.  They tell me that I should never try to defend
myself.</p>

<p>They tell me that I should stop using the GNU General Public
License, a license that vaccinates me against hurt.  Instead, I should
adopt a license that permits other people to rob me with impunity.
They want me to adopt a license that forbids me from fighting back.
They want me to give up my right to benefit from a derivative of my
own work, a right I possess under current copyright law.</p>

<p>Of course, the language is a little less feverish than this.
Usually, I myself am not called &ldquo;infectious&rdquo;.  Rather, the
legal defense that I use is called &ldquo;infectious&rdquo;.  The
license I choose is called &ldquo;viral&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In every day language, words such as &ldquo;infect&rdquo; and
&ldquo;virus&rdquo; describe disease.  The rhetoric is metaphorical.
A legal tool is not a disease organism; but it is popular to think of
the law as an illness, so the metaphor has impact.</p>

<p>The people who want to rob me use language that says I make them
sick when I stop them from robbing me.  They do not want to draw
attention to the so-called &ldquo;disease&rdquo; that makes them ill:
my health and my rights, and the health and rights of other people.
Instead, they choose metaphor to twist people's thinking.  They do not
want anyone to think that I am a good citizen for stopping crime.
They want the metaphor to fool others into thinking that I am a
disease agent.</p>

<p>The GNU General Public License protects me.  The connotation of
&ldquo;virus&rdquo; and &ldquo;infect&rdquo; is that my choice of
defense gives an illness to those who want to rob me.  I want freedom
from their robbery; but they want the power to hurt me.  They get sick
when they cannot hurt me.</p>

<p>To use another health and illness-related metaphor, the GNU General
Public License <em>vaccinates</em> me; it protects me from theft.</p>

<p>Note that the theft about which I am talking is entirely legal in
some situations: if you license your work under a modified BSD
license, or a similar license, then others may legally take your work,
make fixes or improvements to it, and forbid you from using that
code. I personally dislike this arrangement, but it exists.</p>
