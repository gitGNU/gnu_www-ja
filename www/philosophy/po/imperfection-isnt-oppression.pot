"When a free program lacks capabilities that users want, that is unfortunate; "
"we urge people to add what is missing. Some would go further and claim that "
"a program is not even free software if it lacks certain functionality "
"&mdash; that it denies freedom 0 (the freedom to run the program as you "
"wish) to users or uses that it does not support. This argument is misguided "
"because it is based on identifying capacity with freedom, and imperfection "
"with oppression."

"Each program inevitably has certain functionalities and lacks others that "
"might be desirable. There are some jobs it can do, and others it can't do "
"without further work. This is the nature of software."

"The absence of key functionality can mean certain users find the program "
"totally unusable. For instance, if you only understand graphical interfaces, "
"a command line program may be impossible for you to use. If you can't see "
"the screen, a program without a screen reader may be impossible for you to "
"use. If you speak only Greek, a program with menus and messages in English "
"may be impossible for you to use. If your programs are written in Ada, a C "
"compiler is impossible for you to use. To overcome these barriers yourself "
"is unreasonable to demand of you. Free software really ought to provide the "
"functionality you need."

"Free software really ought to provide it, but the lack of that feature does "
"not make the program nonfree, because it is an imperfection, not oppression."

"Making a program nonfree is an injustice committed by the developer that "
"denies freedom to whoever uses it. The developer deserves condemnation for "
"this. It is crucial to condemn that developer, because nobody else can undo "
"the injustice as long as the developer continues to do it. We can, and do, "
"try to rescue the victims by developing a free replacement, but we can't "
"make the nonfree program free."

"Developing a free program without adding a certain important feature is not "
"doing wrong to anyone. Rather, it's doing some good but not all the good "
"that people need. Nobody in particular deserves condemnation for not "
"developing the missing feature, since any capable person could do it. It "
"would be ungrateful, as well as self-defeating, to single out the free "
"program's authors for blame for not having done some additional work."

"What we can do is state that completing the job calls for doing some "
"additional work. That is constructive because it helps us convince someone "

"If you think a certain extension in a free program is important, please push "
"for it in the way that respects our contributors. Don't criticize the people "
"who contributed the useful code we have. Rather, look for a way to complete "
"the job. You can urge the program's developers to turn their attention to "
"the missing feature when they have time for more work. You can offer to help "
"them. You can recruit people or raise funds to support the work."
