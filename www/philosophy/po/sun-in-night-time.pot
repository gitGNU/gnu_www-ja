"<i>We leave this web page in place for the sake of history, but as of "
"December 2006, Sun is in the middle of <a "
"href=\"http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-welcomes-gpl-java.html\">rereleasing its "
"Java platform under the GNU GPL</a>.  When this license change is completed, "
"we expect Sun's Java will be free software.</i>"

"Our community has been abuzz with the rumor that Sun has made its "
"implementation Java free software (or &ldquo;open source&rdquo;).  Community "
"leaders even publicly thanked Sun for its contribution. What is Sun's new "
"contribution to the FLOSS community?"

"Nothing.  Absolutely nothing&mdash;and that's what makes the response to "

"Sun's Java implementation remains proprietary software, just as before.  It "
"doesn't come close to meeting the criteria for <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a>, or the similar but "
"slightly looser criteria for open source.  Its source code is available only "
"under an NDA."

"So what did Sun actually do? It allowed more convenient redistribution of "
"the binaries of its Java platform.  With this change, GNU/Linux distros can "
"include the nonfree Sun Java platform, just as some now include the nonfree "
"nVidia driver.  But they do so only at the cost of being nonfree."

"The Sun license has one restriction that may ironically reduce the tendency "
"for users to accept nonfree software without thinking twice: it insists that "
"the operating system distributor get the user's explicit agreement to the "
"license before letting the user install the code. This means the system "
"cannot silently install Sun's Java platform without warning users they have "
"nonfree software, as some GNU/Linux systems silently install the nVidia "
"driver."

"If you look closely at Sun's announcement, you will see that it accurately "
"represents these facts. It does not say that Sun's Java platform is free "
"software, or even open source. It only predicts that the platform will be "
"&ldquo;widely available&rdquo; on &ldquo;leading open source "
"platforms&rdquo;.  Available, that is, as proprietary software, on terms "
"that deny your freedom."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Why did this non-incident generate a large and confused reaction? Perhaps "
"because people do not read these announcements carefully.  Ever since the "
"term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; was coined, we have seen companies find ways "
"to use it and their product name in the same sentence. (They don't seem to "
"do this with &ldquo;free software&rdquo;, though they could if they wanted "
"to.)  The careless reader may note the two terms in proximity and falsely "
"assume that one talks about the other."

"Some believe that this non-incident represents Sun's exploratory steps "
"towards eventually releasing its Java platform as free software.  Let's hope "
"Sun does that some day.  We would welcome that, but we should save our "
"appreciation for the day that actually occurs.  In the mean time, the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/java-trap.html\">Java Trap</a> still lies in wait for the "
"work of programmers who don't take precautions to avoid it."

"We in the GNU Project continue developing the <a "
"href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/java/\">GNU Compiler for Java and GNU "
"Classpath</a>; we made great progress in the past year, so our free platform "
"for Java is included in many major GNU/Linux distros.  If you want to run "
"Java and have freedom, please join in and help."
