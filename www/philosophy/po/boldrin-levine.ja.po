"levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/intellectual.pdf</a> contains a paper by "
"Boldrin and Levine entitled &ldquo;The case against intellectual "
"property&rdquo;.  It argues on economic grounds that authors can make money "
"by selling their work even in a world where everyone can copy."

"You've probably heard the superficial argument that &ldquo;If the program is "
"free, you will only sell one copy&rdquo;.  The obvious response is that "
"today there are companies that sell thousands of copies a month.  But this "
"paper provides another response: it shows why people who are fully aware of "
"the economic consequences of the freedom to copy would pay a high price for "
"&ldquo;the first copy&rdquo;."

"<a href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty\">The term "
"&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; is biased and spreads confusion.</a> The "
"bias is easy to see&mdash;by calling copyright and patents and trademarks "
"&ldquo;property&rdquo;, it leads people to think that criticizing them is "
"&ldquo;opposing property rights&rdquo;.  The confusion is less evident: by "
"lumping copyright and patents and trademarks together, it leads people to "
"treat them as one thing, to ignore their large differences and consider them "
"as a single issue in terms of their meager similarities."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This usually means ignoring social and ethical aspects of copyrights, and "
"the different social and ethical aspects of patents, and considering both "
"copyrights and patents as a single issue in narrow economic terms.  The "
"proponents of harshly restrictive copyrights and patents then present an "
"economic argument that is so simple that it gives an appearance of being "
"irrefutable."

"I normally respond by showing the aspects of the situation that have been "
"ignored by treating the issue as a purely economic one.  Boldrin and "
"Levine's paper takes on that simple economic argument on its own terms, and "
"shows the gaps in it, gaps that the apparent simplicity tends to hide."

msgid ""
"I believe we should continue to reject the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo;.  We need to call attention to the non-economic aspects of "
"copyrights and the different non-economic aspects of patents.  However, "
"Boldrin and Levine's arguments will be useful for responding to people who "
"insist on narrowing their values to economics."

"The paper is addressed to economists and somewhat mathematical.  "
