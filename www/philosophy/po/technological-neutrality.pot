"Technological neutrality is the principle that the state should not impose "
"preferences for or against specific kinds of technology.  For example, there "
"should not be a rule that specifies whether state agencies should use solid "
"state memory or magnetic disks, or whether they should use GNU/Linux or "
"BSD.  Rather, the agency should let bidders propose any acceptable "
"technology as part of their solutions, and choose the best/cheapest offer by "
"the usual rules."

"The principle of technological neutrality is valid, but it has limits.  Some "
"kinds of technology are harmful; they may pollute air or water, encourage "
"antibiotic resistance, abuse their users, abuse the workers that make them, "
"or cause massive unemployment.  These should be taxed, regulated, "
"discouraged, or even banned."

"The principle of technological neutrality applies only to purely technical "
"decisions.  It is not &ldquo;ethical neutrality&rdquo; or &ldquo;social "
"neutrality&rdquo;; it does not apply to decisions about ethical and social "
"issues&mdash;such as the choice between free software and proprietary "
"software."

"For instance, when the state adopts a policy of migrating to free software "
"in order to restore the computing sovereignty of the country and lead the "
"people towards freedom and cooperation, this isn't a technical preference.  "
"This is an ethical, social and political policy, not a technological "
"policy.  The state is not supposed to be neutral about maintaining the "
"people's freedom or encouraging cooperation.  It is not supposed to be "
"neutral about maintaining or recovering its sovereignty."

"It is the state's duty to insist that the software in its public agencies "
"respect the computing sovereignty of the country, and that the software "
"taught in its schools educate its students in freedom and cooperation.  The "
"state must insist on free software, exclusively, in <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/government-free-software.html\">public agencies</a> and "
"in <a href=\"/education/edu-schools.html\"> education</a>.  The state has "
"the responsibility to maintain control of its computing, so it must not "
"surrender that control to <a "

"Software Substitute</a>.  In addition, the <a "
