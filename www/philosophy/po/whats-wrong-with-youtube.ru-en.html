<h2>What's Wrong with YouTube</h2>

<p>Please
cite <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org/">audio-video.gnu.org</a> as
the site for videos of my speeches &mdash; not YouTube.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why YouTube is a bad choice for where to post
videos or refer to videos.</p>

<ul>
<li>Normal use of YouTube involves use of nonfree software.

  <ul>
   <li>In the HTML5 mode, it involves running
   a <a href="/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree JavaScript
   program</a>.</li>

   <li>In the (non-HTML5) mode, it involves use of Flash Player, which
   is nonfree.  It even tells users to install Flash Player. (This
   mode is deprecated as of January 2015.)</li>
  </ul>

   <p>There are ways to access YouTube without running that nonfree
   software &mdash; Users who are in the know can avoid that problem. For
   instance, you can access the non-HTML5 videos with 
   <a href="/software/gnash/">Gnash</a>, and you can get any of them with 
   <a href="http://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a>.</p>

   <p>However, most users don't use these methods, so putting a video
   on YouTube directs them towards nonfree software.</p>
</li>

<li>YouTube tries to stop people from downloading copies.

 <p>The developers of youtube-dl need to keep changing it as the site
   changes. The mere <em>attempt</em> to stop you from downloading a
   file is mistreating you wrong even if you can overcome it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing about YouTube that is <em>not</em> a moral strike against it
is nonfree software on YouTube servers &mdash; if there is any.
We as outsiders can't tell, because it wouldn't affect us, which is
why it is not an injustice towards us.</p>

<p>If there are any nonfree programs running on YouTube servers, they
mistreat Google by denying Google control of that aspect of its
computing. We hope that Google will reclaim its freedom by ceasing to
use those nonfree programs, if any. But they do not mistreat
the <em>users</em> of that service, so they are not a reason to refuse
to <em>use</em> YouTube.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Dailymotion and Vimeo have the same problem as YouTube's HTML5
option: viewing their videos requires nonfree JavaScript code. If
there is any commercial video-hosting platform that doesn't have this
problem, please inform us.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To post a video without requiring nonfree software to view it, you
can place the video as an Ogg or Webm file on an ordinary web
site.</p>

<p>Another way to publish videos to the web using free software is
<a href="http://mediagoblin.org/">GNU MediaGoblin</a>.  Ideally
you will set up
<a href="http://docs.mediagoblin.org/">your own server</a>, or run
one for your family and friends, but you can also post on
<a href="https://wiki.mediagoblin.org/Live_instances">public
servers</a>.</p>

<p>Please
<a href="https://wiki.mediagoblin.org/HackingHowto">contribute to
GNU MediaGoblin</a> if you can.</p>
