&lt;h2&gt;Measures Governments Can Use to Promote Free Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href="http://www.stallman.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard
Stallman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article suggests policies for a strong and firm effort to promote
free software within the state, and to lead the rest of the country
towards software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of the state is to organize society for the freedom and
well-being of the people.  One aspect of this mission, in the
computing field, is to encourage users to adopt free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state needs to insist on free software in its own computing for
the sake of its computational sovereignty (the state's control over
its own computing).  All users deserve control over their computing,
but the state has a responsibility to the people to maintain control
over the computing it does on their behalf.  Most government
activities now depend on computing, and its control over those
activities depends on its control over that computing.  Losing this
control in an agency whose mission is critical undermines national
security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving state agencies to free software can also provide secondary
benefits, such as saving money and encouraging local software support
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this text, &ldquo;state entities&rdquo; refers to all levels of government, and
means public agencies including schools, public-private partnerships,
largely state-funded activities such as charter schools, and &ldquo;private&rdquo;
corporations controlled by the state or established with special
privileges or functions by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important policy concerns education, since that shapes
the future of the country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educational activities, or at least those of state entities, must
teach only free software (thus, they should never lead students to use
a nonfree program), and should teach the civic reasons for insisting
on free software.  To teach a nonfree program is to teach dependence,
which is contrary to the mission of the school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also crucial are state policies that influence what software
individuals and organizations use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laws and public sector practices must be changed so that they never
require or pressure individuals or organizations to use a nonfree
program.  They should also discourage communication and publication
practices that imply such consequences (including
&lt;a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm"&gt;Digital
Restrictions Management&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever a state entity distributes software to the public,
including programs included in or specified by its web pages, it must
be distributed as free software, and must be capable of running on a
<span class="removed"><del><strong>100%</strong></del></span>
<span class="inserted"><ins><em>platform containing exclusively</em></ins></span> free <span class="removed"><del><strong>environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</strong></del></span> <span class="inserted"><ins><em>software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</em></ins></span>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;State entity web sites and <span class="removed"><del><strong>servers</strong></del></span> <span class="inserted"><ins><em>network services</em></ins></span> must be designed <span class="removed"><del><strong>to function fully
with 100%</strong></del></span> <span class="inserted"><ins><em>so
that users can use them, without disadvantage, by means of</em></ins></span> free <span class="removed"><del><strong>environments on the user's computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</strong></del></span>
<span class="inserted"><ins><em>software exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</em></ins></span>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;State entities must use only file formats and communication
protocols that are well supported by free software, preferably with
published specifications.  (We do not state this in terms of
&ldquo;standards&rdquo; because it should apply to nonstandardized interfaces as
well as standardized ones.)  For example, they must not distribute
audio or video recordings in formats that require Flash or nonfree
codecs, and public libraries must not distribute works with Digital
Restrictions Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several policies affect the computational sovereignty of the state.
State entities must maintain control over their computing, not cede
control to private hands.  These points apply to all computers,
including smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;State entities must migrate to free software, and must not install,
or continue using, any nonfree software except under a temporary
exception.  Only one agency should have the authority to grant these
temporary exceptions, and only when shown compelling reasons.  This
agency's goal should be to reduce the number of exceptions to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a state entity pays for development of a computing solution,
the contract must require it be delivered as free software and be
capable of running on a 100% free environment.  All contracts must
require this, so that if the developer does not comply with this
requirement, the work cannot be paid for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a state entity buys or leases computers, it must choose among
the models that come closest, in their class, to being capable of
running without any proprietary software.  The state should maintain,
for each class of computers, a list of the models authorized based on
this criterion.  Models available to both the public and the state
should be preferred to models available only to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state should negotiate actively with manufacturers to bring
about the availability in the market (to the state and the public) of
suitable hardware products, in all pertinent product areas, that
require no proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state should invite other states to negotiate collectively with
manufacturers about suitable hardware products.  Together they will
have more clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computational sovereignty (and security) of the state includes
control over the computers that do the state's work.  This requires
avoiding &lt;a href="/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html"&gt;
Software as a Service&lt;/a&gt;, unless the service is run by a state
agency under the same branch of government, as well as other practices
that diminish the state control over its computing.  Therefore,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every computer that the state uses must belong to or be leased by
the same branch of government that uses it, and that branch must not
cede to outsiders the right to decide who has physical access to the
computer, who can do maintenance (hardware or software) on it, or
what software should be installed in it.  If the computer is not
portable, then while in use it must be in a physical space of which
the state is the occupant (either as owner or as tenant).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other policy affects free and nonfree software development:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state should encourage developers to create or enhance free
software and who make it available to the public, e.g. by tax breaks
and other financial incentive.  Contrariwise, no such incentives
should be granted for development, distribution or use of nonfree
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, proprietary software developers should not be able to
&ldquo;donate&rdquo; copies to schools and claim a tax write-off for the nominal
value of the software.  Proprietary software is not legitimate in a
school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these measures, the state can recover control over its computing,
and lead the country's citizens, businesses and organizations towards
control over their computing.&lt;/p&gt;
