"And in an ideal world, this would be fine.  Audio formats would be like the "
"conventions of laying out a book, or like pitches and other building-blocks "
"of music: containers of meaning, available for anyone to use, free of "
"restrictions.  You wouldn't have to worry about the consequences of "
"distributing your material in MP3 format, any more than you would worry "
"about putting a page number at the top of a page, or starting a book with a "

"Unfortunately, that is not the world we live in.  MP3 is a patented format.  "
"What this means is that various companies have government-granted monopolies "
"over certain aspects of the MP3 standard, such that whenever someone creates "
"or listens to an MP3 file, <em>even with software not written by one of "
"those companies</em>, the companies have the right to decide whether or not "
"to permit that use of MP3.  Typically what they do is demand money, of "
"course.  But the terms are entirely up to them: they can forbid you from "
"using MP3 at all, if they want.  If you've been using MP3 files and didn't "
"know about this situation, then either a) someone else, usually a software "
"maker, has been paying the royalties for you, or b)  you've been unknowingly "
"infringing on patents, and in theory could be sued for it."

"The harm here goes deeper than just the danger to you.  A software patent "
"grants one party the exclusive right to use a certain mathematical fact.  "
"This right can then be bought and sold, even litigated over like a piece of "
"property, and you can never predict what a new owner might do with it.  This "
"is not just an abstract possibility: MP3 patents have been the subject of "
"multiple lawsuits, with damages totalling more than a billion dollars."

"The most important issue here is not about the fees, it's about the freedom "
"to communicate and to develop communications tools.  Distribution formats "
"such as MP3 are the containers of information exchange on the Internet.  "
"Imagine for a moment that someone had a patent on the modulated vibration of "
"air molecules: you would need a license just to hold a conversation or play "
"guitar for an audience.  Fortunately, our government has long held that old, "
"familiar methods of communication, like vibrating air molecules or writing "
"symbols on pieces of paper, are not patentable: no one can own them, they "
"are free for everyone to use.  But until those same liberties are extended "
"to newer, less familiar methods (like particular standards for representing "
"sounds via digital encoding), we who generate audio works must take care "
"what format we use&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and require our listeners to use."

"Ogg Vorbis is an alternative to MP3.  It gets high sound quality, can "
"compress down to a smaller size than MP3 while still sounding good (thus "
"saving you time and bandwidth costs), and best of all, is designed to be "
"completely free of patents."

"You won't sacrifice any technical quality by encoding your audio in Ogg "
"Vorbis.  The files sound fine, and most players know how to play them.  But "
"you will increase the total number of people who can listen to your tracks, "

"formats."

"The Ogg Vorbis home page, <a href=\"http://www.vorbis.com/\" "
">www.vorbis.com</a>, has all the information you need to both listen to and "
"produce Vorbis-encoded files.  The safest thing, for you and your listeners, "
"would be to offer Ogg Vorbis files exclusively.  But since there are still "
"some players that can only handle MP3, and you don't want to lose audience, "
"a first step is to offer both Ogg Vorbis and MP3, while explaining to your "
"downloaders (perhaps by linking to this article) exactly why you support Ogg "
"Vorbis."

"Up till now, the MP3 patent owners have been clever enough not to harass "
"individual users with demands for payment.  They know that would stimulate "
"popular awareness of (and eventually opposition to)  the patents.  Instead, "
"they go after the makers of products that implement the MP3 format.  The "
"victims of these shakedowns shrug wearily and pay up, viewing it as just "
"another cost of doing business, which is then passed on invisibly to users.  "
"However, not everyone is in a position to pay: some of your listeners use "
"free software programs to play audio files.  Because this software is freely "
"copied and downloaded, there is no practical way for either the authors or "
"the users to pay a patent fee&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;that is, to pay for the "
"right to use the mathematical facts that underly the MP3 format.  As a "
"result, these programs cannot legally implement MP3, even though the tracks "
"the users want to listen to may themselves be perfectly free! Because of "
"this situation, some distributors of the GNU/Linux computer operating "
"system&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;which has millions of users "
"worldwide&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;have been unable to include MP3 players in their "
"software distributions."

"Luckily, you don't have to require such users to engage in civil "
"disobedience every time they want to listen to your works.  By offering Ogg "
"Vorbis, you ensure that no listeners have to get involved with a patented "
"distribution format unless they choose to, and that your audio works will "
"never be hampered by unforseen licensing requirements.  Eventually, the "
"growing acceptance of Ogg Vorbis as a standard, coupled with increasingly "
"unpredictable behavior by some of the MP3 patent holders, may make it "
"impractical to offer MP3 files at all.  But even before that day comes, Ogg "
"Vorbis remains the only portable, royalty-free audio format on the Internet, "
"and it's worth a little extra effort to support."
