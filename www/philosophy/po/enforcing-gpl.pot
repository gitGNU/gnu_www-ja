"Microsoft's anti-GPL offensive this summer has sparked renewed speculation "
"about whether the GPL is &ldquo;enforceable.&rdquo; This particular example "
"of &ldquo;FUD&rdquo; (fear, uncertainty and doubt)  is always a little "
"amusing to me.  I'm the only lawyer on earth who can say this, I suppose, "
"but it makes me wonder what everyone's wondering about: Enforcing the <a "
"href=\"/licenses/gpl.html\">GPL</a> is something that I do all the time."

"Because <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a> is an "
"unorthodox concept in contemporary society, people tend to assume that such "
"an atypical goal must be pursued using unusually ingenious, and therefore "
"fragile, legal machinery.  But the assumption is faulty.  The goal of the "
"Free Software Foundation in designing and publishing the GPL, <em>is</em> "
"unfortunately unusual: we're reshaping how programs are made in order to "
"give everyone the right to understand, repair, improve, and redistribute the "
"best-quality software on earth.  This is a transformative enterprise; it "
"shows how in the new, networked society traditional ways of doing business "
"can be displaced by completely different models of production and "
"distribution.  But the GPL, the legal device that makes everything else "
"possible, is a very robust machine precisely because it is made of the "
"simplest working parts."

"The essence of copyright law, like other systems of property rules, is the "
"power to exclude.  The copyright holder is legally empowered to exclude all "
"others from copying, distributing, and making derivative works."

"This right to exclude implies an equally large power to license&mdash;that "
"is, to grant permission to do what would otherwise be forbidden.  Licenses "
"are not contracts: the work's user is obliged to remain within the bounds of "
"the license not because she voluntarily promised, but because she doesn't "
"have any right to act at all except as the license permits."

"But most proprietary software companies want more power than copyright alone "
"gives them.  These companies say their software is &ldquo;licensed&rdquo; to "
"consumers, but the license contains obligations that copyright law knows "
"nothing about.  Software you're not allowed to understand, for example, "
"often requires you to agree not to decompile it.  Copyright law doesn't "
"prohibit decompilation, the prohibition is just a contract term you agree to "
"as a condition of getting the software when you buy the product under shrink "
"wrap in a store, or accept a &ldquo;clickwrap license&rdquo; on line.  "
"Copyright is just leverage for taking even more away from users."

"The GPL, on the other hand, subtracts from copyright rather than adding to "
"it.  The license doesn't have to be complicated, because we try to control "
"users as little as possible.  Copyright grants publishers power to forbid "
"users to exercise rights to copy, modify, and distribute that we believe all "
"users should have; the GPL thus relaxes almost all the restrictions of the "
"copyright system.  The only thing we absolutely require is that anyone "
"distributing GPL'd works or works made from GPL'd works distribute in turn "
"under GPL.  That condition is a very minor restriction, from the copyright "
"point of view.  Much more restrictive licenses are routinely held "
"enforceable: every license involved in every single copyright lawsuit is "
"more restrictive than the GPL."

"Because there's nothing complex or controversial about the license's "
"substantive provisions, I have never even seen a serious argument that the "
"GPL exceeds a licensor's powers.  But it is sometimes said that the GPL "
"can't be enforced because users haven't &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; it."

"This claim is based on a misunderstanding.  The license does not require "
"anyone to accept it in order to acquire, install, use, inspect, or even "
"experimentally modify GPL'd software.  All of those activities are either "
"forbidden or controlled by proprietary software firms, so they require you "
"to accept a license, including contractual provisions outside the reach of "
"copyright, before you can use their works.  The free software movement "
"thinks all those activities are rights, which all users ought to have; we "
"don't even <em>want</em> to cover those activities by license.  Almost "
"everyone who uses GPL'd software from day to day needs no license, and "
"accepts none.  The GPL only obliges you if you distribute software made from "
"GPL'd code, and only needs to be accepted when redistribution occurs.  And "
"because no one can ever redistribute without a license, we can safely "
"presume that anyone redistributing GPL'd software intended to accept the "
"GPL.  After all, the GPL requires each copy of covered software to include "
"the license text, so everyone is fully informed."

"Despite the FUD, as a copyright license the GPL is absolutely solid.  That's "

"Meanwhile, much murmuring has been going on in recent months to the supposed "
"effect that the absence of judicial enforcement, in US or other courts, "
"somehow demonstrates that there is something wrong with the GPL, that its "
"unusual policy goal is implemented in a technically indefensible way, or "
"that the Free Software Foundation, which authors the license, is afraid of "
"testing it in court.  Precisely the reverse is true.  We do not find "
"ourselves taking the GPL to court because no one has yet been willing to "
"risk contesting it with us there."

"So what happens when the GPL is violated? With software for which the Free "
"Software Foundation holds the copyright (either because we wrote the "
"programs in the first place, or because free software authors have assigned "
"us the copyright, in order to take advantage of our expertise in protecting "
"their software's freedom), <a href=\"/licenses/gpl-violation.html\">the "
"first step is a report</a>, usually received by email to <a "
"href=\"mailto:license-violation@gnu.org\">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</a>.  "
"<a href=\"/licenses/gpl-violation.html\">We ask the reporters of violations "
"to help us establish necessary facts</a>, and then we conduct whatever "
"further investigation is required."

"We reach this stage dozens of times a year.  A quiet initial contact is "
"usually sufficient to resolve the problem.  Parties thought they were "
"complying with GPL, and are pleased to follow advice on the correction of an "
"error.  Sometimes, however, we believe that confidence-building measures "
"will be required, because the scale of the violation or its persistence in "
"time makes mere voluntary compliance insufficient.  In such situations we "
"work with organizations to establish GPL-compliance programs within their "
"enterprises, led by senior managers who report to us, and directly to their "
"enterprises' managing boards, regularly.  In particularly complex cases, we "
"have sometimes insisted upon measures that would make subsequent judicial "
"enforcement simple and rapid in the event of future violation."

"In approximately a decade of enforcing the GPL, I have never insisted on "
"payment of damages to the Foundation for violation of the license, and I "
"have rarely required public admission of wrongdoing.  Our position has "
"always been that compliance with the license, and security for future good "
"behavior, are the most important goals.  We have done everything to make it "
"easy for violators to comply, and we have offered oblivion with respect to "
"past faults."

"In the early years of the free software movement, this was probably the only "
"strategy available.  Expensive and burdensome litigation might have "
"destroyed the FSF, or at least prevented it from doing what we knew was "
"necessary to make the free software movement the permanent force in "
"reshaping the software industry that it has now become.  Over time, however, "
"we persisted in our approach to license enforcement not because we had to, "
"but because it worked.  An entire industry grew up around free software, all "
"of whose participants understood the overwhelming importance of the "
"GPL&mdash;no one wanted to be seen as the villain who stole free software, "
"and no one wanted to be the customer, business partner, or even employee of "
"such a bad actor.  Faced with a choice between compliance without publicity "
"or a campaign of bad publicity and a litigation battle they could not win, "
"violators chose not to play it the hard way."

"We have even, once or twice, faced enterprises which, under US copyright "
"law, were engaged in deliberate, criminal copyright infringement: taking the "
"source code of GPL'd software, recompiling it with an attempt to conceal its "
"origin, and offering it for sale as a proprietary product.  I have assisted "
"free software developers other than the FSF to deal with such problems, "
"which we have resolved&mdash;since the criminal infringer would not "
"voluntarily desist and, in the cases I have in mind, legal technicalities "
"prevented actual criminal prosecution of the violators&mdash;by talking to "
"redistributors and potential customers.  &ldquo;Why would you want to pay "
"serious money,&rdquo; we have asked, &ldquo;for software that infringes our "
"license and will bog you down in complex legal problems, when you can have "
"the real thing for free?&rdquo; Customers have never failed to see the "
"pertinence of the question.  The stealing of free software is one place "
"where, indeed, crime doesn't pay."

"But perhaps we have succeeded too well.  If I had used the courts to enforce "
"the GPL years ago, Microsoft's whispering would now be falling on deaf "
"ears.  Just this month I have been working on a couple of moderately sticky "
"situations.  &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;at how many people all over "
"the world are pressuring me to enforce the GPL in court, just to prove I "
"can.  I really need to make an example of someone.  Would you like to "

"Someday someone will.  But that someone's customers are going to go "
"elsewhere, talented technologists who don't want their own reputations "
"associated with such an enterprise will quit, and bad publicity will smother "
"them.  And that's all before we even walk into court.  The first person who "
"tries it will certainly wish he hadn't.  Our way of doing law has been as "
"unusual as our way of doing software, but that's just the point.  Free "
"software matters because it turns out that the different way is the right "
"way after all."
