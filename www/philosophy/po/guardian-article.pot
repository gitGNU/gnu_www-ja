"The European Union software patent directive, which this 2003 article "
"opposed, was ultimately dropped by its own supporters after facing lots of "
"opposition.  However, they later found another way to impose software "
"patents on most of Europe: through fine print in the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/europes-unitary-patent.html\">unitary patent</a>."

"The computer industry is threatened by a Wild West-style land grab. The "
"biggest, richest companies are being assisted by governments to take "
"unassailable exclusive control of the ideas that programmers combine to make "
"a program."

"Our society is becoming more dependent on information technology. At the "
"same time, centralised control over and ownership of the information "
"technology field is increasing, and mega-corporations with law-given "
"dominion over our computers could take away our freedoms and democracy.  "
"With an effective monopoly on modern software, the largest grabbers of the "
"&ldquo;land&rdquo; will have control over what we can ask our computers to "
"do, and control over production and distribution of information on the net, "
"through monopolies that the EU plans to give them."

"The monopolies are patents, each one restricting use of one or several of "
"these software ideas. We call them &ldquo;software patents&rdquo; because "
"they restrict what we programmers can make software do. How do these "
"monopolies work? If you wish to use your computer as a word processor, it "
"must follow instructions that tell it how to act like a word processor. This "
"is analogous to instructions found on a musical score, which tell an "
"orchestra how to play a symphony. The instructions are not simple. They are "
"made up of thousands of smaller instructions, much like sequences of notes "
"and chords. A symphonic score embodies hundreds of musical ideas, and a "
"computer program uses hundreds or thousands of software ideas. Since each "
"idea is abstract, there are often different ways to describe it: thus, some "
"ideas can be patented in multiple ways."

"The US, which has had software patents since the 1980s, shows what this can "
"do to development of everyday software. For example, in the US there are 39 "
"monopoly claims over a standard way of showing video using software "
"techniques (the <abbr title=\"Moving Picture Experts Group\">MPEG</abbr> 2 "
"format)."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Since a single piece of software can embody thousands of ideas together, and "
"those ideas are arbitrary in scope and abstract in nature, writing software "
"will only be worthwhile for those who are rich and have a large software "
"monopoly portfolio: those with the war chest and clout to fight off claims "
"that might otherwise sink a business. In the US, the average cost of "
"defending against an invalid patent claim is $1.5 million. The courts favour "
"the wealthy, so even when a small business gets a few patents, it will find "
"them useless."

"Software patents are being claimed at a tremendous rate in the US. If they "
"become legal in Europe, most of those US patents will be extended to Europe "
"also. This is likely to have a devastating effect on European software "
"development&mdash;leading to job losses, a poorer economy, more expensive "
"computer use, and less choice and less freedom for the end user.  The "
"advocates of software patents in Europe, and the probable beneficiaries of "
"them, are the patent bureaucracy (more influence on more areas of life), "
"patent lawyers (more business from both plaintiffs and defendants), and "
"computer mega-corporations such as IBM and Microsoft."

"Foremost among the software mega-corporations is Microsoft. Even as part of "
"the European commission investigates Microsoft for monopolistic practices, "
"another part is planning to hand it an unending series of overlapping "
"20-year monopolies. Bill Gates wrote in his Challenges and Strategy memo of "
"May 16 1991 that"

"If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's "

"The European commission says its proposed directive on computer-implemented "
"inventions will disallow software patents. But the text was actually written "
"by the Business Software Alliance, which represents the largest software "
"companies. (The commission didn't admit this&mdash;we detected it.) It "
"contains vague words that we suspect are designed to open the door for "
"software patents."

"The text says that computer-related patents must make a &ldquo;technical "
"contribution&rdquo;; the commission says that means &ldquo;no software "
"patents&rdquo;.  But &ldquo;technical&rdquo; can be interpreted in many "
"ways. The European patent office is already registering software patents of "
"dubious legal validity, defying the treaty that governs it and the "
"governments that established it.  Operating under those words, it will "
"stretch them to allow all kinds of software patents."

"Arlene McCarthy, <abbr title=\"Member of the European "

"promoting and acting as rapporteur for this proposed directive. The cosmetic "
"changes she has so far proposed do nothing to solve the problem.  However, "
"the cultural affairs commission's amendment that defines "
"&ldquo;technical&rdquo; will assure British and European software developers "
"that they will not risk a lawsuit simply by writing and distributing a "
"software package."
