"Wikipedia uses the term &ldquo;source model&rdquo; in a confused and "

"distributed, but the text confuses this with the development methodology.  "
"It distinguishes &ldquo;open source&rdquo; and &rdquo;shared source&rdquo; "
"as answers, but they overlap &mdash; Microsoft uses the latter as a "
"marketing term to cover a range of practices, some of which are &ldquo;open "
"source&rdquo;.  Thus, this term really conveys no coherent information, but "
"it provides an opportunity to say &ldquo;open source&rdquo; in pages "
