"Hello Richard,\n"
"\n"
"    It seems that your efforts to build resistance to Amazon's\n"
"ludicrous one-click patent are really paying off!  My father is a\n"
"stock broker, and tonight he showed me a news item which came over his\n"
"company's internal wire service describing (fairly accurately) the\n"
"boycott and your roll in it.  Apparently it has been widely\n"
"distributed among the brokerage firms, and AMZN was down 7 points\n"
"today on the news (at least, there was no other readily-apparent\n"
"reason for the downturn).\n"
"\n"
"    Perhaps now that Amazon is getting hit in the pocketbook, they'll\n"
"pay more attention.\n"
"\n"
"    Congratulations!  Keep it up.\n"
"\n"
"As always, best wishes,\n"
"Nat\n"
