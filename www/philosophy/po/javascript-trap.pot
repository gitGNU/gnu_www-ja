"In the free software community, the idea that nonfree programs mistreat "
"their users is familiar.  Some of us refuse entirely to install proprietary "
"software, and many others consider nonfreedom a strike against the program.  "
"Many users are aware that this issue applies to the plug-ins that browsers "
"offer to install, since they can be free or nonfree."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"But browsers run other nonfree programs which they don't ask you about or "
"even tell you about&mdash;programs that web pages contain or link to.  These "
"programs are most often written in JavaScript, though other languages are "
"also used."

"JavaScript (officially called ECMAScript, but few use that name) was once "
"used for minor frills in web pages, such as cute but inessential navigation "
"and display features.  It was acceptable to consider these as mere "
"extensions of HTML markup, rather than as true software; they did not "
"constitute a significant issue."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Many sites still use JavaScript that way, but some use it for major programs "
"that do large jobs.  For instance, Google Docs downloads into your machine a "
"JavaScript program which measures half a megabyte, in a compacted form that "
"we could call Obfuscript because it has no comments and hardly any "
"whitespace, and the method names are one letter long.  The source code of a "
"program is the preferred form for modifying it; the compacted code is not "
"source code, and the real source code of this program is not available to "
"the user."

"Browsers don't normally tell you when they load JavaScript programs.  Most "
"browsers have a way to turn off JavaScript entirely, but none of them can "
"check for JavaScript programs that are nontrivial and nonfree.  Even if "
"you're aware of this issue, it would take you considerable trouble to "
"identify and then block those programs.  However, even in the free software "
"community most users are not aware of this issue; the browsers' silence "
"tends to conceal it."

"It is possible to release a JavaScript program as free software, by "
"distributing the source code under a free software license.  But even if the "
"program's source is available, there is no easy way to run your modified "
"version instead of the original.  Current free browsers do not offer a "
"facility to run your own modified version instead of the one delivered in "
"the page.  The effect is comparable to tivoization, although not quite so "
"hard to overcome."

"JavaScript is not the only language web sites use for programs sent to the "
"user.  Flash supports programming through an extended variant of "
"JavaScript.  We will need to study the issue of Flash to make suitable "
"recommendations.  Silverlight seems likely to create a problem similar to "
"Flash, except worse, since Microsoft uses it as a platform for nonfree "
"codecs.  A free replacement for Silverlight does not do the job for the free "
"world unless it normally comes with free replacement codecs."

"Java applets also run in the browser, and raise similar issues.  In general, "
"any sort of applet system poses this sort of problem.  Having a free "
"execution environment for an applet only brings us far enough to encounter "
"the problem."

"A strong movement has developed that calls for web sites to communicate only "
"through formats and protocols that are free (some say &quot;open&quot;); "
"that is to say, whose documentation is published and which anyone is free to "
"implement.  With the presence of programs in web pages, that criterion is "
"necessary, but not sufficient.  JavaScript itself, as a format, is free, and "
"use of JavaScript in a web site is not necessarily bad.  However, as we've "
"seen above, it also isn't necessarily OK.  When the site transmits a program "
"to the user, it is not enough for the program to be written in a documented "
"and unencumbered language; that program must be free, too.  &ldquo;Only free "
"programs transmitted to the user&rdquo; must become part of the criterion "
"for proper behavior by web sites."

"Silently loading and running nonfree programs is one among several issues "
"raised by &quot;web applications&quot;.  The term &quot;web "
"application&quot; was designed to disregard the fundamental distinction "
"between software delivered to users and software running on the server.  It "
"can refer to a specialized client program running in a browser; it can refer "
"to specialized server software; it can refer to a specialized client program "
"that works hand in hand with specialized server software.  The client and "
"server sides raise different ethical issues, even if they are so closely "
"integrated that they arguably form parts of a single program.  This article "
"addresses only the issue of the client-side software.  We are addressing the "
"server issue separately."

"How do we tell whether the JavaScript code is free? At the end of this "

"Finally, we need to change free browsers to detect and block nontrivial "
"nonfree JavaScript in web pages.  The program <a "
"href=\"/software/librejs/\">LibreJS</a> detects nonfree, nontrivial "
"JavaScript in pages you visit, and blocks it.  LibreJS is an add-on for "

"Browser users also need a convenient facility to specify JavaScript code to "
"use <em>instead</em> of the JavaScript in a certain page.  (The specified "
"code might be total replacement, or a modified version of the free "
"JavaScript program in that page.)  Greasemonkey comes close to being able to "
"do this, but not quite, since it doesn't guarantee to modify the JavaScript "
"code in a page before that program starts to execute.  Using a local proxy "
"works, but is too inconvenient now to be a real solution.  We need to "
"construct a solution that is reliable and convenient, as well as sites for "
"sharing changes.  The GNU Project would like to recommend sites which are "
"dedicated to free changes only."

"These features will make it possible for a JavaScript program included in a "
"web page to be free in a real and practical sense.  JavaScript will no "
"longer be a particular obstacle to our freedom&mdash;no more than C and Java "
"are now.  We will be able to reject and even replace the nonfree nontrivial "
"JavaScript programs, just as we reject and replace nonfree packages that are "
"offered for installation in the usual way.  Our campaign for web sites to "
"free their JavaScript can then begin."

"In the mean time, there's one case where it is acceptable to run a nonfree "
