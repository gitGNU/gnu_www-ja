"An activity (such as a service) doesn't exist in the form of copies, so it's "

"To use a culinary analogy, my cooking can't be a copy of your cooking, not "
"even if I learned to cook by watching you. I might have and use a copy of "
"the <em>recipe</em> you use to do your cooking, because a recipe, like a "
"program, is a work and exists in copies, but the recipe is not the same as "
"the cooking. (And neither of those is the same as the food produced by the "

"With today's technology, services are often implemented by running programs "
"on computers, but that is not the only way to implement them.  (In fact, "
"there are network services that are implemented by asking human beings to "
"enter responses to questions.) In any case, the implementation is not "
"visible to users of the service, so it has no direct effect on them."

"A network service can raise issues of free vs nonfree software for its users "
"through the client software needed to use it. If the service requires using "
"a nonfree client program, use of the service requires ceding your freedom to "
"that program. With many web services, the nonfree software is <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/javascript-trap.html\"> JavaScript code</a> silently "
"installed in the user's browser. The <a href=\"/software/librejs\">GNU "
"LibreJS</a> program makes it easier to refuse to run this nonfree JavaScript "
"code. But the issue of the client software is logically separate from the "
"service as such."

"There is one case where a service is directly comparable to a program: when "
"using the service is equivalent to having a copy of a hypothetical program "
"and running it yourself. In this case, we call it Software as a Service "
"(<acronym title=\"Software as a Service\">SaaS</acronym>), or Service as a "
"Software Substitute (<acronym title=\"Service as a Software "
"Substitute\">SaaSS</acronym> &mdash; this term explains more clearly what "
"the issue is), and such a service is always a bad thing.  The job it does is "
"the users' own computing, and the users ought to have full control over "
"that.  The way for users to have control over their own computing is to do "
"it by running their own copies of a free program.  Using someone else's "
"server to do that computing implies losing control of it."

"SaaSS is equivalent to using a nonfree program with surveillance features "
"and a universal back door, so <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html\">you should "
"reject it and replace it with a free program</a> that does the same job."
msgstr ""

"However, most services' principal functions are communicating or publishing "
"information; they are nothing like running any program yourself, so they are "
"not SaaSS. They could not be replaced by your copy of a program, either; a "
"program running in your own computers, used solely by you, is not enough by "
"itself to communicate with other people."

"Non-SaaSS services can mistreat their users in other ways. Issues about a "
"service can include whether it misuses the data you send it, and whether it "
"collects other data (surveillance). The <a "
"href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090124084811/http://autonomo.us/2008/07/franklin-street-statement/\">Franklin "
"Street Statement</a> made a stab at addressing these issues, but we don't "
"have a firm position on them as yet. What's clear is that the issues about a "
"service are <em>different</em> from the issues about a program. Thus, for "
"clarity's sake, it is better not to apply the terms &ldquo;free&rdquo; and "
"&ldquo;nonfree&rdquo; to a service."

"Let's suppose a service is implemented using software: the server operator "
"has copies of many programs, and runs them to implement the service. These "
"copies may be free software or not. If the operator developed them and uses "
"them without distributing copies, they are free in a trivial sense since "
"every user (there's only one) has the four freedoms."

"If some of them are nonfree, that usually doesn't directly affect users of "
"the service. They are not running those programs; the service operator is "
"running them. In a special situation, these programs can indirectly affect "
"the users of the service: if the service holds private information, users "
"might be concerned that nonfree programs on the server might have back doors "
"allowing someone else to see their data. In effect, nonfree programs on the "
"server require users to trust those programs' developers as well as the "
"service operator. How significant this is in practice depends on the "
"details, including what jobs the nonfree programs do."

"However, the one party that is <em>certainly</em> mistreated by the nonfree "
"programs implementing the service is the server operator herself. We don't "
"condemn the server operator for being at the mercy of nonfree software, and "
"we certainly don't boycott her for this.  Rather, we are concerned for her "
"freedom, as with any user of nonfree software. Given an opportunity, we try "
"to explain how it curtails her freedom, hoping she will switch to free "
"software."

"Conversely, if the service operator runs GNU/Linux or other free software, "
"that's not a virtue that affects you, but rather a benefit for her.  We "
"don't praise or thank her for this; rather we felicitate her for making the "
"wise choice."

"If she has developed some software for the service, and released it as free "
"software, that's the point at which we have a reason to thank her. We "

"Thus, we don't have a rule that free systems shouldn't use (or shouldn't "
"depend on) services (or sites) implemented with nonfree software. However, "
"they should not depend on, suggest or encourage use of services which are "
"SaaSS; use of SaaSS needs to be replaced by use of free software.  All else "
"being equal, it is good to favor those service providers who contribute to "
"the community by releasing useful free software, and good to favor "
"peer-to-peer communication over server-based centralized communication, for "
"activities that don't inherently require a central hub."
