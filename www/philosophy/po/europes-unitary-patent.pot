"Software patents are dangerous to software developers because they impose "

"nontrivial software if you must thread a maze of patents. See "

"because in 2004 I estimated that the GNU/Linux operating system implemented "
"around 100,000 actually patented ideas. (Linux, the kernel, had been found "
"by Dan Ravicher to contain 283 such ideas, and was estimated to be .25% of "
"the whole system at the time.)"

"The consequences are becoming manifest now in the US, but multinational "
"companies have long lobbied to spread software patents around the world.  In "
"2005, the European Parliament took up the second reading of a directive that "
"had been proposed by the European Commission to authorize software "
"patents. The Parliament had previously amended it to reject them, but the "
"Council of Europe had undone those amendments."

"The Commission's text was written in a sneaky way: when read by laymen, it "
"appeared to forbid patents on pure software ideas, because it required a "
"patent application to have a physical aspect.  However, it did not require "
"the &ldquo;inventive step&rdquo;, the advance that constitutes a patentable "
"&ldquo;invention&rdquo;, to be physical."

"This meant that a patent application could present the required physical "
"aspect just by mentioning the usual physical elements of the computer on "
"which the program would run (processor, memory, display, etc.). It would not "
"have to propose any advance in these physical elements, just cite them as "
"part of the larger system also containing the software.  Any computational "
"idea could be patented this way. Such a patent would only cover software "
"meant for running on a computer, but that was not much of a limitation, "
"since it is not practical to run a large program by hand simulation."

"A massive grass-roots effort&mdash;the first one ever directed at convincing "
"the European Parliament&mdash;resulted in defeat of the directive. But that "
"does not mean we convinced half of Parliament to reject software patents.  "
"Rather, it seems the pro-patent forces decided at the last minute to junk "
"their own proposal."

"The volunteer activists drifted away, thinking the battle won, but the "
"corporate lobbyists for software patents were paid to stay on the job.  Now "
"they have contrived another sneaky method: the &ldquo;unitary patent&rdquo; "
"system proposed for the EU. Under this system, if the European Patent Office "
"issues a patent, it will automatically be valid in every participating "
"country, which in this case means all of the EU except for Spain and Italy."

"How would that affect software patents? Evidently, either the unitary patent "
"system would allow software patents or it wouldn't. If it allows them, no "
"country will be able to escape them on its own. That would be bad, but what "
"if the system rejects software patents? Then it would be good&mdash;right?"

"Right&mdash;except the plan was designed to prevent that. A small but "
"crucial detail in the plan is that appeals against the EPO's decisions would "
"be decided based on the EPO's own rules. The EPO could thus tie European "
"business and computer users in knots to its heart's content."

"The EPO has a vested interest in extending patents into as many areas of "
"life as it can get away with. With external limits (such as national courts) "
"removed, the EPO could impose software patents, or any other controversial "
"kind of patents. For instance, if it chooses to decide that natural genes "
"are patentable, as <a "
"href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110729/16573515324/appeals-court-says-genes-are-patentable-because-theyre-separate-your-dna.shtml\">a "
"US appeals court just did</a>, no one could reverse that decision except "
"perhaps the European Court of Justice."

"In fact, the EPO's decision about software patents has already been made, "
"and can be seen in action. The EPO has issued tens of thousands of software "
"patents, in contempt for the treaty that established it. (See <a "
"href=\"http://webshop.ffii.org/\">&ldquo;Your web shop is "
"patented&rdquo;</a>.) At present, though, each state decides whether those "
"patents are valid. If the unitary patent system is adopted and the EPO gets "
"unchecked power to decide, Europe will get US-style patent wars."

"The European Court of Justice ruled in March that a unitary patent system "
"would have to be subject to its jurisdiction, but it isn't clear whether its "
"jurisdiction would include substantive policy decisions such as &ldquo;can "
"software ideas be patented?&rdquo; That's because it's not clear how the "
"European Patent Convention relates to the ECJ."

"If the ECJ can decide this, the plan would no longer be certain "
"disaster. Instead, the ball would be one bounce away from disaster.  Before "
"adopting such a system, Europe should rewrite the plan to make certain "
"software is safe from patents. If that can't be done, the next best thing is "
"to reject the plan entirely. Minor simplifications are not worth a disaster; "
"harmonization is a misguided goal if it means doing things wrong everywhere."

"The UK government seems to wish for the disaster, since <a "
"href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/commissairebarnier.pdf\">it stated in December "

"You will note that the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; has not been "
"used in this article. That term spreads confusion because it is applied to a "
"dozen unrelated laws. Even if we consider just patent law and copyright law, "
"they are so different in their requirements and effects that generalizing "
"about the two is a mistake. Absolutely nothing in this article pertains to "
"copyright law. To avoid leading people to generalize about disparate laws, I "
"never use the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;, and I never miss it "
"either."
