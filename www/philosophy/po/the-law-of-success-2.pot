"Partly it's because I resent being pushed around. I resent anyone giving me "

"children are taught any of these things any more. Partly because not long "
"before I was born, there was a World War against some horrible dictators and "

"And so I was sensitised to notice the difference between free software, "

"Because the community fell apart in the early 80s and it was no longer "

"Yes. With regard to software. First of all, this is a big question.  In "
"regard to software, proprietary software does not respect users' freedom "
"because the program controls the users. If the users aren't free to change a "
"program and do so either individually or in groups cooperating, then the "
"program controls the users."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Now, with typical proprietary software there is even a licence that says "
"what users are allowed to do with the program and what they're not allowed "
"to do and it can be as restrictive as the developer chooses to make it. For "
"instance, there is a Microsoft program for managing webpages, websites, and "
"its licence says it can't be used to publish anything that criticises "
"Microsoft. So here, nonfree software takes away your freedom of speech."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This is obviously intolerable. If you can't use your copy freely you can't "
"control your computing. You can only do what you're told.  But then the "
"second level of control, through the source, through writing the code of the "
"program; if you use a program whose code was written by somebody else and "
"you can't see it or change it then that somebody controls what you do. He "
"could make the program do nasty things to you, and even if you happen to "
"find out, you still can't change it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Finding out is difficult because you don't have the source code.  Sometimes "
"you will notice some sign that it's doing a nasty thing.  Other times you "
"won't notice. For instance, Windows has spy features which send information "
"about the use of the machine to Microsoft and users can't see that this is "
"happening. It was not easy to find out that these spy features are there, "
"but people found out. They had to be somewhat clever, in some cases, to "
"discover these spy features."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"And then there is a back door in Windows which allows Microsoft to forcibly "
"install software changes. It doesn't have to ask permission, it can just "
"sneak them in. So this is what I mean when I say a program controls the "
"users. But even if there's no back door to allow the developer to install "
"changes, it's still the case that the program does what the developer chose "
"to make it do, and if you don't like that, you can't change it. So you're "
"stuck with it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"So the back door is sort of icing on the cake for his power, because it "
"means that even if he forgot to do something nasty, he can put it in "
"retroactively. Without that kind of back door, he's limited to the nasty "
"things that he thought of in advance."

"There are many proprietary programs that are widely used, that do "
"surveillance; there are many that are specifically designed to restrict what "
"users could do. Those restrictions which limit what users could do on the "
"data in their machines are known as digital restrictions management or DRM, "
"also sometimes referred to as digital handcuffs. So the point is, using "
"those programs is like being handcuffed because you can't just move your "
"hands around anywhere you like, the program is stopping you."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"And these are intentional features. Of course, programs also have bugs, and "
"if you don't have the source code you can't fix the bugs.  So the users, in "
"order to be free, must have the source code, and they must be able to run "
"their own modified versions of the source code in place of the original. And "
"they have to be free also to distribute their modified versions.  Because if "
"you don't have that freedom then you could fix a problem for yourself but "
"you couldn't fix it for anyone else, which means that each individual user "
"would have to fix the problem.  It would have to be fixed over and over and "
"over."

"Also with the freedom to distribute your modified version, the people who "

"So if I'm using the free program and I make a change in it, which I know how "
"to do, then I could publish my modified version and then you.  Perhaps "
"you're not a programmer; you would still be able to get the benefit of the "
"change I make. Not only that, you could pay somebody to change the program "
"for you, or you could join an organisation whose goal is to change a certain "
"program in a certain way, and all the members would put in their money, and "
"that's how they would hire a programmer to change it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"So the definition of free software is the four freedoms that are needed for "
"the users to have control of their computing. Freedom zero is the freedom to "
"run the program. Freedom one is the freedom to study the source code and "
"change it so it does your computing as you wish. Freedom two is the freedom "
"to help others, which is the freedom to redistribute exact copies. And "
"freedom three is the freedom to contribute to your community, which is the "
"freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions. So these four "
"freedoms ensure that the users, both individually and collectively, control "
"the program. If the users don't control the program then the program "
"controls the users. That's proprietary software and that is what makes it "
"evil."

"Creative commons licences grant the users varying amounts of freedom.  Two "

"The other creative commons licences do not go far enough to make the work "
"free. However, I wouldn't say that all published works must be free. I think "
"the published works that must be free are the ones that you use to do "
"practical jobs. So that means software, recipes for cooking&mdash;and "
"recipes for cooking are a good examples because, as I'm sure you know, cooks "
"frequently share and modify recipes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid "Sure, yes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"And it would be a tremendous outrage to stop them. So in effect, cooks treat "
"recipes as free. But let's look at some more works that are used for "
"practical jobs. Educational works are used for practical jobs; to teach "
"yourself or teach others. Reference works are used for practical jobs; to "
"look up some information. And then there are text fonts, which we use to "
"display or print text so it can be read. These are examples of works of "
"practical use. These are not the only examples.  I m sure you can find some "
"more. Anyway, works of practical use are the ones that I believe must be "
"free."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"However there are other kinds of works. For instance, there are essays of "
"opinion and scientific papers and there are artistic works, and their "
"contributions to society are of a different kind. They don't contribute "
"through helping you do practical jobs. They are useful in other ways. So I "
"draw different conclusions about them. I think the crucial conclusion for "
"those other works is the freedom to non-commercially redistribute exact "
"copies, in other words the freedom to share."

"I was rather lucky, in a sense. I was in a position to do something that "
