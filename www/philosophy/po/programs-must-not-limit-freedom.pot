"Free software means software controlled by its users, rather than the "
"reverse. Specifically, it means the software comes with <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\">four essential freedoms "
"that software users deserve</a>. At the head of the list is freedom zero, "
"the freedom to run the program as you wish, in order to do what you wish."

"Some developers propose to place usage restrictions in software licenses to "
"ban using the program for certain purposes, but that would be a disastrous "
"path. This article explains why freedom zero must not be limited. Conditions "
"to limit the use of a program would achieve little of their aims, but could "
"wreck the free software community."

"First of all, let's be clear what freedom zero means. It means that the "
"distribution of the software does not restrict how you use it.  This doesn't "
"make you exempt from laws. For instance, fraud is a crime in the US&mdash;a "
"law which I think is right and proper.  Whatever the free software license "
"says, using a free program to carry out your fraud won't shield you from "
"prosecution."

"A license condition against fraud would be superfluous in a country where "
"fraud is a crime. But why not a condition against using it for torture, a "
"practice that states frequently condone when carried out by the "
"&ldquo;security forces&rdquo;?"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"A condition against torture would not work, because enforcement of any free "
"software license is done through the state. A state that wants to carry out "
"torture will ignore the license. When victims of US torture try suing the US "
"government, courts dismiss the cases on the grounds that their treatment is "
"a national security secret. If a software developer tried to sue the US "
"government for using a program for torture against the conditions of its "
"license, that suit would be dismissed too. In general, states are clever at "
"making legal excuses for whatever terrible things they want to "
"do. Businesses with powerful lobbies can do it too."

"What if the condition were against some specialized private activity? For "
"instance, PETA proposed a license that would forbid use of the software to "
"cause pain to animals with a spinal column. Or there might be a condition "
"against using a certain program to make or publish drawings of Mohammad. Or "
"against its use in experiments with embryonic stem cells. Or against using "
"it to make unauthorized copies of musical recordings."

"It is not clear these would be enforcible. Free software licenses are based "
"on copyright law, and trying to impose usage conditions that way is "
"stretching what copyright law permits, stretching it in a dangerous "
"way. Would you like books to carry license conditions about how you can use "
"the information in them?"

"The fact is, people have very different ethical ideas about the activities "
"that might be done using software. I happen to think those four unusual "
"activities are legitimate and should not be forbidden.  In particular I "
"support the use of software for medical experiments on animals, and for "
"processing meat. I defend the human rights of animal right activists but I "
"don't agree with them; I would not want PETA to get its way in restricting "
"the use of software."

"Since I am not a pacifist, I would also disagree with a &ldquo;no military "
"use&rdquo; provision. I condemn wars of aggression but I don't condemn "
"fighting back. In fact, I have supported efforts to convince various armies "
"to switch to free software, since they can check it for back doors and "
"surveillance features that could imperil national security."

"Since I am not against business in general, I would oppose a restriction "

"I've stated some of my views about other political issues, about activities "
"that are or aren't unjust. Your views might differ, and that's precisely the "
"point. If we accepted programs with usage restrictions as part of a free "
"operating system such as GNU, people would come up with lots of different "
"usage restrictions. There would be programs banned for use in meat "
"processing, programs banned only for pigs, programs banned only for cows, "
"and programs limited to kosher foods. Someone who hates spinach might write "
"a program allowing use for processing any vegetable except spinach, while a "
"Popeye fan might allow use only for spinach. There would be music programs "
"allowed only for rap music, and others allowed only for classical music."

"The result would be a system that you could not count on for any "

"How would users respond to that? I think most of them would use proprietary "
"systems. Allowing any usage restrictions whatsoever in free software would "
"mainly push users towards nonfree software.  Trying to stop users from doing "
"something through usage restrictions in free software is as ineffective as "
"pushing on an object through a long, soft, straight piece of spaghetti."

"It is worse than ineffective; it is wrong too, because software developers "
"should not exercise such power over what users do. Imagine selling pens with "
"conditions about what you can write with them; that would be noisome, and we "
"should not stand for it. Likewise for general software. If you make "
"something that is generally useful, like a pen, people will use it to write "
"all sorts of things, even horrible things such as orders to torture a "
"dissident; but you must not have the power to control people's activities "
"through their pens.  It is the same for a text editor, compiler or kernel."

"You do have an opportunity to determine what your software can be used for: "
"when you decide what functionality to implement. You can write programs that "
"lend themselves mainly to uses you think are positive, and you have no "
"obligation to write any features that might lend themselves to activities "
"you disapprove of."

"The conclusion is clear: a program must not restrict what jobs its users do "
"with it. Freedom zero must be complete. We need to stop torture, but we "
"can't do it through software licenses. The proper job of software licenses "
"is to establish and protect users' freedom."
