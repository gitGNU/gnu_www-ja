"When I co-signed the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/ec_letter_mysql_oct19.pdf\">letter objecting to Oracle's "
"planned purchase of MySQL</a><sup><a href=\"#footnote\">1</a></sup> (along "
"with the rest of Sun), some free software supporters were surprised that I "
"approved of the practice of selling license exceptions which the MySQL "
"developers have used.  They expected me to condemn the practice outright.  "
"This article explains what I think of the practice, and why."

"Selling exceptions means that the copyright holder of the code releases it "
"to the public under a free software license, then lets customers pay for "
"permission to use the same code under different terms, for instance allowing "
"its inclusion in proprietary applications."

"We must distinguish the practice of selling exceptions from something "
"crucially different: purely proprietary extensions or versions of a free "
"program.  These two activities, even if practiced simultaneously by one "
"company, are different issues.  In selling exceptions, the same code that "
"the exception applies to is available to the general public as free "
"software.  An extension or a modified version that is only available under a "
"proprietary license is proprietary software, pure and simple, and no better "
"than any other proprietary software.  This article is concerned with cases "
"that involve strictly and only the sale of exceptions."

"I've considered selling exceptions acceptable since the 1990s, and on "
"occasion I've suggested it to companies.  Sometimes this approach has made "
"it possible for important programs to become free software."

"The KDE desktop was developed in the 90s based on the Qt library.  Qt was "
"proprietary software, and TrollTech charged for permission to embed it in "
"proprietary applications.  TrollTech allowed gratis use of Qt in free "
"applications, but this did not make it free/libre software.  Completely free "
"operating systems therefore could not include Qt, so they could not use KDE "
"either."

"In 1998, the management of TrollTech recognized that they could make Qt free "
"software and continue charging for permission to embed it in proprietary "
"software.  I do not recall whether the suggestion came from me, but I "
"certainly was happy to see the change, which made it possible to use Qt and "
"thus KDE in the free software world."

"Initially, they used their own license, the Q Public License "
"(QPL)&mdash;quite restrictive as free software licenses go, and incompatible "
"with the GNU GPL.  Later they switched to the GNU GPL; I think I had "
"explained to them that it would work for the purpose."

"Selling exceptions depends fundamentally on using a copyleft license, such "
"as the GNU GPL, for the free software release.  A copyleft license permits "
"embedding in a larger program only if the whole combined program is released "
"under that license; this is how it ensures extended versions will also be "
"free.  Thus, users that want to make the combined program proprietary need "
"special permission.  Only the copyright holder can grant that, and selling "
"exceptions is one style of doing so.  Someone else, who received the code "
"under the GNU GPL or another copyleft license, cannot grant an exception."

"When I first heard of the practice of selling exceptions, I asked myself "
"whether the practice is ethical.  If someone buys an exception to embed a "
"program in a larger proprietary program, he's doing something wrong (namely, "
"making proprietary software).  Does it follow that the developer that sold "
"the exception is doing something wrong too?"

"If that implication is valid, it would also apply to releasing the same "
"program under a noncopyleft free software license, such as the X11 license.  "
"That also permits such embedding.  So either we have to conclude that it's "
"wrong to release anything under the X11 license&mdash;a conclusion I find "
"unacceptably extreme&mdash;or reject this implication.  Using a noncopyleft "
"license is weak, and usually an inferior choice, but it's not wrong."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"In other words, selling exceptions permits limited embedding of the code in "
"proprietary software, but the X11 license goes even further, permitting "
"unlimited use of the code (and modified versions of it) in proprietary "
"software.  If this doesn't make the X11 license unacceptable, it doesn't "
"make selling exceptions unacceptable."

"There are three reasons why the FSF doesn't practice selling exceptions.  "
"One is that it doesn't lead to the FSF's goal: assuring freedom for each "
"user of our software.  That's what we wrote the GNU GPL for, and the way to "
"achieve this most thoroughly is to release under GPL version 3-or-later and "
"not allow embedding in proprietary software.  Selling exceptions wouldn't "
"achieve this, just as release under the X11 license wouldn't.  So normally "
"we don't do either of those things.  We release under the GPL only."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Another reason we release only under the GPL is so as not to permit "
"proprietary extensions that would present practical advantages over our free "
"programs.  Users for whom freedom is not a value might choose those non-free "
"versions rather than the free programs they are based on&mdash;and lose "
"their freedom.  We don't want to encourage that."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But there are occasional cases where, for specific reasons of strategy, we "
"decide that using a more permissive license on a certain program is better "
"for the cause of freedom.  In those cases, we release the program to "
"everyone under that permissive license."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"This is because of another ethical principle that the FSF follows: to treat "
"all users the same.  An idealistic campaign for freedom should not "
"discriminate, so the FSF is committed to giving the same license to all "
"users.  The FSF never sells exceptions; whatever license or licenses we "
"release a program under, that is available to everyone."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But we need not insist that companies follow that principle.  I consider "
"selling exceptions an acceptable thing for a company to do, and I will "
"suggest it where appropriate as a way to get programs freed."
