"A couple of weeks ago, the Open Group changed the license of Motif, inviting "
"free software developers to use it.  However, the new Motif license does not "
"fit either the definition of free software, or the looser definition of open "
"source software."

"Their announcement says they have released Motif to &ldquo;the open source "
"community&rdquo;, but this is true only in an unnatural interpretation of "
"the words.  They have not made Motif available within the free software "
"community; instead, they have invited the people in the free software "
"community to leave the community by using Motif."

"I've written to the Open Group about this, asking them to change the "
"license.  We can hope they will, but we can't assume it.  In the present "
"circumstances, we have to treat Motif the same way we treated it before: not "
"available for us.  Motif still cannot be part of a free operating system, "
"and combining or linking someone else's GPL-covered code with Motif is still "
"a violation of the GPL except in very special circumstances."

"Fortunately there is a free software alternative to Motif, called LessTif.  "
"Most programs that were written for Motif can use LessTif with no changes.  "
"Please support the free software community by using LessTif rather than "
"Motif.  Some finishing work still needs to be done on LessTif; to volunteer, "

msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li>
msgid ""
"It claims that you accept the license merely by &ldquo;using&rdquo; Motif.  "
"Only a shrink-wrap license or something similar can do that, and shrink-wrap "
"licenses are a bad thing."

"The license is restricted to use on certain operating systems, those which "
"fit a category they call &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.  Both the free software "
"movement and the open source camp consider use restrictions unacceptable."

#. type: Content of: <ul><li>
msgid ""
"Their definition of the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; is very different "
"from the one used by the open source camp, thus causing confusion."

"In the free software movement, we disagree with the philosophy and values of "
"open source.  (For more explanation, see <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html\">open-source-misses-the-point.html</a>.)  "
"But even though we do not support open source or advocate what it stands "
"for, we think people should not misrepresent what it stands for.  The facts "
"of the situation are complex enough; confusing the issue is not welcome."
