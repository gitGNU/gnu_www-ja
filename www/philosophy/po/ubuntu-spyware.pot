"Since <a "
"href=\"http://fossbytes.com/the-spyware-feature-in-ubuntu-will-be-disabled-in-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-xerus/\">Ubuntu "
"version 16.04</a>, the spyware search facility is now disabled by default.  "
"It appears that the campaign of pressure launched by this article has been "
"partly successful.  Nonetheless, offering the spyware search facility as an "
"option is still a problem, as explained below.  Ubuntu should make the "
"network search a command users can execute from time to time, not a "
"semipermanent option for users to enable (and probably forget)."

"Even though the factual situation described in the rest of this page has "

"One of the major advantages of free software is that the community protects "
"users from malicious software.  Now Ubuntu <a "

"Proprietary software is associated with malicious treatment of the user: "
"surveillance code, digital handcuffs (DRM or Digital Restrictions "
"Management) to restrict users, and back doors that can do nasty things under "
"remote control.  Programs that do any of these things are malware and should "
"be treated as such.  Widely used examples include Windows, the iThings, and "
"the Amazon &ldquo;Kindle&rdquo; product for virtual book burning, which do "
"all three; Macintosh and the Playstation III which impose DRM; most portable "
"phones, which do spying and have back doors; Adobe Flash Player, which does "
"spying and enforces DRM; and plenty of apps for iThings and Android, which "
"are guilty of one or more of these nasty practices."

"<a href=\"/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html\"> Free "

"Once in a while, users who know programming find that a free program has "
"malicious code.  Generally the next thing they do is release a corrected "
"version of the program; with the four freedoms that define free software "
"(see <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>), "
"they are free to do this.  This is called a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; of the "
"program.  Soon the community switches to the corrected fork, and the "
"malicious version is rejected.  The prospect of ignominious rejection is not "
"very tempting; thus, most of the time, even those who are not stopped by "
"their consciences and social pressure refrain from putting malfeatures in "
"free software."

"But not always.  Ubuntu, a widely used and influential <a "
"href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\"> GNU/Linux </a> distribution, has installed "
"surveillance code.  When the user searches her own local files for a string "
"using the Ubuntu desktop, Ubuntu sends that string to one of Canonical's "
"servers.  (Canonical is the company that develops Ubuntu.)"

"This is just like the first surveillance practice I learned about in "
"Windows.  My late friend Fravia told me that when he searched for a string "
"in the files of his Windows system, it sent a packet to some server, which "
"was detected by his firewall.  Given that first example I paid attention and "
"learned about the propensity of &ldquo;reputable&rdquo; proprietary software "
"to be malware.  Perhaps it is no coincidence that Ubuntu sends the same "
"information."

"Ubuntu uses the information about searches to show the user ads to buy "
"various things from Amazon.  <a "
"href=\"http://stallman.org/amazon.html\">Amazon commits many wrongs</a>; by "
"promoting Amazon, Canonical contributes to them.  However, the ads are not "
"the core of the problem.  The main issue is the spying.  Canonical says it "
"does not tell Amazon who searched for what.  However, it is just as bad for "
"Canonical to collect your personal information as it would have been for "
"Amazon to collect it.  Ubuntu surveillance is <a "
"href=\"http://nathanheafner.com/home/2013/09/22/ubuntu-dash-search-is-not-anonymous/\">not "

"People will certainly make a modified version of Ubuntu without this "
"surveillance.  In fact, several GNU/Linux distros are modified versions of "
"Ubuntu.  When those update to the latest Ubuntu as a base, I expect they "
"will remove this.  Canonical surely expects that too."

"Most free software developers would abandon such a plan given the prospect "
"of a mass switch to someone else's corrected version.  But Canonical has not "
"abandoned the Ubuntu spyware.  Perhaps Canonical figures that the name "
"&ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo; has so much momentum and influence that it can avoid "
"the usual consequences and get away with surveillance."

"Canonical says this feature searches the Internet in other ways.  Depending "

"Ubuntu allows users to switch the surveillance off.  Clearly Canonical "
"thinks that many Ubuntu users will leave this setting in the default state "
"(on).  And many may do so, because it doesn't occur to them to try to do "
"anything about it.  Thus, the existence of that switch does not make the "
"surveillance feature ok."

"Even if it were disabled by default, the feature would still be dangerous: "
"&ldquo;opt in, once and for all&rdquo; for a risky practice, where the risk "
"varies depending on details, invites carelessness.  To protect users' "
"privacy, systems should make prudence easy: when a local search program has "
"a network search feature, it should be up to the user to choose network "
"search explicitly <em>each time</em>.  This is easy: all it takes is to have "
"separate buttons for network searches and local searches, as earlier "
"versions of Ubuntu did.  A network search feature should also inform the "
"user clearly and concretely about who will get what personal information of "
"hers, if and when she uses the feature."

"If a sufficient part of our community's opinion leaders view this issue in "
"personal terms only, if they switch the surveillance off for themselves and "
"continue to promote Ubuntu, Canonical might get away with it.  That would be "
"a great loss to the free software community."

"We who present free software as a defense against malware do not say it is a "
"perfect defense.  No perfect defense is known.  We don't say the community "
"will deter malware <em>without fail</em>.  Thus, strictly speaking, the "
"Ubuntu spyware example doesn't mean we have to eat our words."

"But there's more at stake here than whether some of us have to eat some "
"words.  What's at stake is whether our community can effectively use the "
"argument based on proprietary spyware.  If we can only say, &ldquo;free "
"software won't spy on you, unless it's Ubuntu,&rdquo; that's much less "
"powerful than saying, &ldquo;free software won't spy on you.&rdquo;"

"It behooves us to give Canonical whatever rebuff is needed to make it stop "
"this.  Any excuse Canonical offers is inadequate; even if it used all the "

"If you ever recommend or redistribute GNU/Linux, please remove Ubuntu from "
