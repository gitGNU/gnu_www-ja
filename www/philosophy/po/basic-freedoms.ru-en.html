    The <a href= "http://www.ciec.org/"
    >Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition</a> came together to
    oppose Congress' first attempt to regulate content on the Internet,
    the Communications Decency Act, which the U.S. Supreme Court found
    unconstitutional on June 26, 1997. Their site is being preserved as
    a resource on the landmark CDA case.

    <a href="/philosophy/censoring-emacs.html">Censoring GNU Emacs</a>
    describes how the Communications Decency Act required the GNU
    Project to censor GNU Emacs&mdash;and how this paradoxically had
    the opposite of the effect that the censors wanted.

  <li>You can read <a href="http://www.vtw.org/speech/index.html#decision">the
       June 1996 appeals court decision</a>
       rejecting censorship of the Internet.  But remember, this decision
       is <em>not</em> final!  First, the Supreme Court will agree or disagree;
       then Congress gets a chance to look for another method of censorship.</li>
