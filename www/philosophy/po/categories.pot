"Free software is software that comes with permission for anyone to use, "

"Free software is a matter of freedom, not price. But proprietary software "
"companies typically use the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo; to refer to "
"price. Sometimes they mean that you can obtain a binary copy at no charge; "
"sometimes they mean that a copy is bundled with a computer that you are "
"buying, and the price includes both.  Either way, it has nothing to do with "
"what we mean by free software in the GNU project."

"Because of this potential confusion, when a software company says its "

"Many languages have two separate words for &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in freedom "
"and &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in zero price. For example, French has "
"&ldquo;libre&rdquo; and &ldquo;gratuit&rdquo;. Not so English; there is a "
"word &ldquo;gratis&rdquo; that refers unambiguously to price, but no common "
"adjective that refers unambiguously to freedom. So if you are speaking "
"another language, we suggest you translate &ldquo;free&rdquo; into your "
"language to make it clearer. See our list of <a href= "

msgid ""
"Copylefted software is free software whose distribution terms ensure that "
"all copies of all versions carry more or less the same distribution terms.  "
"This means, for instance, that copyleft licenses generally disallow others "
"to add additional requirements to the software (though a limited set of safe "
"added requirements can be allowed) and require making source code "
"available.  This shields the program, and its modified versions, from some "
"of the common ways of making a program proprietary."

"Copyleft is a general concept; to copyleft an actual program, you need to "
"use a specific set of distribution terms. There are many possible ways to "
"write copyleft distribution terms, so in principle there can be many "
"copyleft free software licenses.  However, in actual practice nearly all "
"copylefted software uses the <a href=\"/copyleft/gpl.html\">GNU General "
"Public License</a>. Two different copyleft licenses are usually "
"&ldquo;incompatible&rdquo;, which means it is illegal to merge the code "
"using one license with the code using the other license; therefore, it is "
"good for the community if people use a single copyleft license."
