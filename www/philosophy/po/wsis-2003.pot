"The benefit of computers is that it's easier to copy and manipulate "

"Software patents restrict how you use your computer.  They restrict "
"developing software.  A big program combines dozens or hundreds of ideas.  "
"When each idea can be patented, only IBMs and Microsofts can safely write "
"software.  Bye bye to any independent local software industry.  Software "
"patents must be rejected."

"Copyrights restrict using and sharing information&mdash;exactly what your "
"computer is for.  It was fine to trade away the freedom to copy when only "
"publishers could copy; the public lost nothing.  Today peer-to-peer sharing "
"must be legal.  WSIS should not teach people that sharing is wrong."

"Copyrights block access to scientific publications.  Every university should "

"Then there's the economic effect.  When companies have power over you, they "
"bleed you dry.  Copyrights and software patents increase the digital divide "
"and concentrate wealth.  We have too much scarcity in the world; let's not "
"create more.  TRIPS is bad enough, but software patents and the WIPO "
"copyright treaty go beyond TRIPS, and WSIS should reject them."

"Computer users need software that respects their freedom.  We call it "
"&ldquo;free (libre) software&rdquo;, meaning freedom, not gratis.  You have "

"Free software means you control your computing.  With non-free software, the "

"With free software, you can make the program do what you want.  "
"&ldquo;You&rdquo; could mean an individual programmer, a company, or a group "
"of users with similar needs.  Non-programmers can convince or pay "
"programmers to make changes for you.  With free software, you're free to "
"make it handle your language.  Free to adapt it for your disability."

"You need free software to train master programmers.  Non-free software is a "
"secret, so nobody can learn from it.  Free software gives talented young "
"people in Africa the chance to learn how to work on real software.  School "
"should also teach students the spirit of cooperation.  All schools should "
"use free software."

"Free software is necessary for sustainable development.  If everyone in your "

"that's not development, that's electronic colonization."
