"Who should your computer take its orders from? Most people think their "
"computers should obey them, not obey someone else.  With a plan they call "
"&ldquo;trusted computing&rdquo;, large media corporations (including the "
"movie companies and record companies), together with computer companies such "
"as Microsoft and Intel, are planning to make your computer obey them instead "
"of you.  (Microsoft's version of this scheme is called Palladium.)  "
"Proprietary programs have included malicious features before, but this plan "
"would make it universal."

"Proprietary software means, fundamentally, that you don't control what it "
"does; you can't study the source code, or change it.  It's not surprising "
"that clever businessmen find ways to use their control to put you at a "
"disadvantage.  Microsoft has done this several times: one version of Windows "
"was designed to report to Microsoft all the software on your hard disk; a "
"recent &ldquo;security&rdquo; upgrade in Windows Media Player required users "
"to agree to new restrictions.  But Microsoft is not alone: the KaZaa "
"music-sharing software is designed so that KaZaa's business partner can rent "
"out the use of your computer to its clients.  These malicious features are "
"often secret, but even once you know about them it is hard to remove them, "
"since you don't have the source code."

"In the past, these were isolated incidents.  &ldquo;Trusted computing&rdquo; "
"would make the practice pervasive.  &ldquo;Treacherous computing&rdquo; is a "
"more appropriate name, because the plan is designed to make sure your "
"computer will systematically disobey you.  In fact, it is designed to stop "
"your computer from functioning as a general-purpose computer.  Every "
"operation may require explicit permission."

"The technical idea underlying treacherous computing is that the computer "
"includes a digital encryption and signature device, and the keys are kept "
"secret from you.  Proprietary programs will use this device to control which "
"other programs you can run, which documents or data you can access, and what "
"programs you can pass them to.  These programs will continually download new "
"authorization rules through the Internet, and impose those rules "
"automatically on your work.  If you don't allow your computer to obtain the "
"new rules periodically from the Internet, some capabilities will "
"automatically cease to function."

"Of course, Hollywood and the record companies plan to use treacherous "
"computing for Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), so that downloaded "
"videos and music can be played only on one specified computer.  Sharing will "
"be entirely impossible, at least using the authorized files that you would "
"get from those companies.  You, the public, ought to have both the freedom "
"and the ability to share these things.  (I expect that someone will find a "
"way to produce unencrypted versions, and to upload and share them, so DRM "
"will not entirely succeed, but that is no excuse for the system.)"

"Making sharing impossible is bad enough, but it gets worse.  There are plans "

"Word processors such as Microsoft Word could use treacherous computing when "
"they save your documents, to make sure no competing word processors can read "
"them.  Today we must figure out the secrets of Word format by laborious "
"experiments in order to make free word processors read Word documents.  If "
"Word encrypts documents using treacherous computing when saving them, the "
"free software community won't have a chance of developing software to read "

"Digital Millennium Copyright Act."

"Programs that use treacherous computing will continually download new "

"like what you said in a document you wrote, they could post new instructions "
"telling all computers to refuse to let anyone read that document.  Each "
"computer would obey when it downloads the new instructions.  Your writing "
"would be subject to 1984-style retroactive erasure.  You might be unable to "

"You might think you can find out what nasty things a treacherous-computing "

"deal, but you can't even expect the deal to stand still.  Once you come to "
"depend on using the program, you are hooked and they know it; then they can "
"change the deal.  Some applications will automatically download upgrades "
"that will do something different&mdash;and they won't give you a choice "

"Today you can avoid being restricted by proprietary software by not using "
"it.  If you run GNU/Linux or another free operating system, and if you avoid "
"installing proprietary applications on it, then you are in charge of what "
"your computer does.  If a free program has a malicious feature, other "
"developers in the community will take it out, and you can use the corrected "
"version.  You can also run free application programs and tools on nonfree "
"operating systems; this falls short of fully giving you freedom, but many "
"users do it."

"Treacherous computing puts the existence of free operating systems and free "
"applications at risk, because you may not be able to run them at all.  Some "
"versions of treacherous computing would require the operating system to be "
"specifically authorized by a particular company.  Free operating systems "
"could not be installed.  Some versions of treacherous computing would "
"require every program to be specifically authorized by the operating system "
"developer.  You could not run free applications on such a system.  If you "
"did figure out how, and told someone, that could be a crime."

"There are proposals already for US laws that would require all computers to "
"support treacherous computing, and to prohibit connecting old computers to "
"the Internet.  The CBDTPA (we call it the Consume But Don't Try Programming "
"Act) is one of them.  But even if they don't legally force you to switch to "
"treacherous computing, the pressure to accept it may be enormous.  Today "
"people often use Word format for communication, although this causes several "
"sorts of problems (see <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html\">&ldquo;We Can Put an End to "
"Word Attachments&rdquo;</a>).  If only a treacherous-computing machine can "
"read the latest Word documents, many people will switch to it, if they view "
"the situation only in terms of individual action (take it or leave it).  To "
"oppose treacherous computing, we must join together and confront the "
"situation as a collective choice."

"The GNU Project distributes the GNU Privacy Guard, a program that implements "

"When someone uses GPG to send you an encrypted document, and you use GPG to "
"decode it, the result is an unencrypted document that you can read, forward, "
"copy, and even reencrypt to send it securely to someone else.  A "
"treacherous-computing application would let you read the words on the "
"screen, but would not let you produce an unencrypted document that you could "
"use in other ways.  GPG, a free software package, makes security features "

"Microsoft presents Palladium as a security measure, and claims that it will "
"protect against viruses, but this claim is evidently false.  A presentation "
"by Microsoft Research in October 2002 stated that one of the specifications "
"of Palladium is that existing operating systems and applications will "
"continue to run; therefore, viruses will continue to be able to do all the "
"things that they can do today."

"When Microsoft employees speak of &ldquo;security&rdquo; in connection with "
"Palladium, they do not mean what we normally mean by that word: protecting "
"your machine from things you do not want.  They mean protecting your copies "
"of data on your machine from access by you in ways others do not want.  A "
"slide in the presentation listed several types of secrets Palladium could be "
"used to keep, including &ldquo;third party secrets&rdquo; and &ldquo;user "
"secrets&rdquo;&mdash;but it put &ldquo;user secrets&rdquo; in quotation "
"marks, recognizing that this is somewhat of an absurdity in the context of "
"Palladium."

"The presentation made frequent use of other terms that we frequently "
"associate with the context of security, such as &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, "
"&ldquo;malicious code&rdquo;, &ldquo;spoofing&rdquo;, as well as "
"&ldquo;trusted&rdquo;.  None of them means what it normally means.  "
"&ldquo;Attack&rdquo; doesn't mean someone trying to hurt you, it means you "
"trying to copy music.  &ldquo;Malicious code&rdquo; means code installed by "
"you to do what someone else doesn't want your machine to do.  "
"&ldquo;Spoofing&rdquo; doesn't mean someone's fooling you, it means your "
"fooling Palladium.  And so on."

"A previous statement by the Palladium developers stated the basic premise "
"that whoever developed or collected information should have total control of "
"how you use it.  This would represent a revolutionary overturn of past ideas "
"of ethics and of the legal system, and create an unprecedented system of "
"control.  The specific problems of these systems are no accident; they "
"result from the basic goal.  It is the goal we must reject."
