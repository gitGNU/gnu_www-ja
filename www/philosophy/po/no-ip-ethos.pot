"Most free software licenses are based on copyright law, and for good reason: "

"There's another reason not to use contract law: It would require every "

"It's true that in countries like China, where copyright law is generally not "

"However, this is not a reason to press for more copyright enforcement in "

"Disney wishes to stamp out semi-underground organizations that sell exact "
"copies. With free software, regardless of precisely which free license is "
"used, that kind of copying is legal. What we want to prevent, when the free "
"software license is the GNU <a href=\"/copyleft/gpl.html\">GPL</a>, is the "
"release of proprietary software products based on our code. That kind of "
"abuse is at its worst when carried out by large, well-known companies "
"&mdash; and they are easier targets for enforcement. So GPL enforcement in "
"China is not a lost cause, though it won't be easy."

"Nonetheless, Meeker's claim that this leads to a global problem is simply "

"Although this error might seem to be the central point of Meeker's article, "
"it is not. The real central point of the article is the perspective embodied "
"in her use of the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;. She uses this "
"term pervasively as though it refers to something coherent &mdash; something "
"it makes sense to talk about and think about. If you believe that, you have "

"Sometimes Meeker switches between &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and "

"thing. Sometimes she switches between &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; "
"and &ldquo;patents&rdquo; as if they were two names for the same "

"Along with the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; goes a false "
