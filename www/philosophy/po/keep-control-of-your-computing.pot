"The World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 as a system for "
"publishing and viewing information, is slowly being transformed into a "
"system of remote computing. It will store your data, and data about you, "
"often limiting your access to it but allowing FBI access at any time. It "
"will do your computing for you, but you cannot control what it does. It "
"provides various tempting attractions, but you must resist them."

"In the 1980s, most people did not use computers; those who did, mostly used "
"personal computers or timesharing services. Both allowed you to install "
"software of your choice. Both allowed you full control over your data, "
"though it is not clear what access the timesharing services gave to the "
"FBI. In any case, the timesharing services mostly faded away by the 90s."

"This does not mean that these users had control of their computing.  With "
"software, either the users control the program (free software) or the "
"program controls the users (proprietary or nonfree software).  Those users "
"were running proprietary software because that's all there was at the "
"time. The users could not change it, or even tell what it really did."

"The abusiveness of proprietary software has intensified since then; "
"nowadays, it is likely to spy on you, intentionally restrict you, and/or "
"have back doors. (Windows is known to do all three; likewise the iPhone and "
"the Kindle.) But even absent such abuse, it wasn't right for users to be "
"controlled by their software."

"That's why I launched the free software movement in 1983. We decided to "
"develop an operating system and applications that would be entirely free "
"(libre, freie), so that the users would have control over them.  I gave this "
"system the name GNU. (You have probably heard people call it \"Linux\", but "
"that's an error.) People who switch to this system, and insist on using only "
"free software, are in a position to control their computing. We have "
"liberated only a small part of cyberspace, as yet, but that is a foothold "
"for freedom."

"Developments in the Web threaten to negate this achievement. The first "
"problem was the use of invisible references to sites whose mission was "
"surveillance (perhaps for advertising). Users who visited sites A, B, X and "
"Z did not realize that those pages contained invisible references to "
"iamwatchingyou.com, so each visit informed that site too, and it recorded "
"permanently that this user had visited certain pages."

"Javascript created a further problem. Initially used for harmless things "
"such as unusual-looking menus, its capabilities have been extended to the "
"point where it can do nontrivial computing. Services such as Google Docs "
"install large Javascript programs into the user's browser. Even though they "
"run in your computer, you have no control over what they do there."

"Then there is the issue of storing your data in companies' servers.  The "
"largest such companies have little respect for users' privacy.  For "
"instance, if you hand your data to Facebook, companies pay Facebook (not "
"you) for the use of it. They pay Facebook (not you) to run ads using your "
"face."

"The timesharing companies of the 1980s had usually treated their users' data "
"with respect, even though they could occasionally abuse them, because their "
"users were paying clients and could go elsewhere.  Facebook's users do not "
"pay, so they are not its clients. They are its merchandise, to be sold to "
"other businesses. If the company is in the US, or is a subsidiary of a US "
"company, the FBI can collect this data at whim without even a court order "
"under an un-American US law, named in purest blackwhiting the \"Patriot "
"Act\"."

"There is a systematic marketing campaign to drive users to entrusting their "

"different computing structures that its only real meaning is, \"Do it "
"without thinking about what you're doing\"."

"There is even a product, Google ChromeOS, designed so that it can only store "
"data remotely, and the user must do her computing remotely.  Ironically, it "
"is free software, a version of GNU/Linux. Users will have access to the "
"source code, and could change it so as to support local computing and local "
"data storage &mdash; if the machine has enough memory to store it, and if it "
"permits users to install their own versions of the software. If Android "
"phones are any guide, most ChromeOS devices will be designed to prevent "
"users from doing that."
