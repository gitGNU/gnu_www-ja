"<cite> This bill fits a pattern: every time Congress wants to create a new "
"monopoly covering some activity formerly open to all, or extend and increase "
"an old monopoly, they apply the term &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; to the free "
"activity that the monopoly will stamp out.  So whenever you see anything "
"described as &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; aside from the capturing of ships, watch "
"out for your liberties! -- Richard Stallman </cite>"
