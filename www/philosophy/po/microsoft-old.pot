"Many people think of Microsoft as the monster menace of the software "
"industry. There is even a campaign to boycott Microsoft. This feeling has "
"intensified since Microsoft expressed active hostility towards free "
"software."

"In the free software movement, our perspective is different. We see that "
"Microsoft is doing something that is bad for software users: making software "
"<a href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware\"> proprietary</a> "
"and thus denying users their rightful freedom."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But Microsoft is not alone in this; almost all software companies do the "
"same thing to the users. If other companies manage to dominate fewer users "
"than Microsoft, that is not for lack of trying."

"This is not meant to excuse Microsoft. Rather, it is meant as a reminder "
"that Microsoft is the natural development of a software industry based on <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/shouldbefree.html\">dividing users and taking away their "
"freedom</a>. When criticizing Microsoft, we must not exonerate the other "
"companies that also make proprietary software. At the FSF, we don't run any "
"proprietary software&mdash;not from Microsoft or anyone else."

"In the &ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo;, released at the end of October "
"1998, Microsoft executives stated an intention to use various methods to "
"obstruct the development of free software: specifically, designing secret "
"protocols and file formats, and patenting algorithms and software features."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"These obstructionist policies are nothing new: Microsoft, and many other "
"software companies, have been doing them for years now. In the past, "
"probably, their motivation was to attack each other; now, it seems, we are "
"among the intended targets. But that change in motivation has no practical "
"consequence, because secret conventions and software patents obstruct "
"everyone, regardless of the &ldquo;intended target&rdquo;."

"Secrecy and patents do threaten free software. They have obstructed us "
"greatly in the past, and we must expect they will do so even more in the "
"future. But this is no different from what was going to happen even if "
"Microsoft had never noticed us. The only real significance of the "
"&ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo; is that Microsoft seems to think that the "
"<a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">GNU/Linux system</a> has the potential "
"for great success."
