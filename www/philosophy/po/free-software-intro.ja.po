"People use free software operating systems such as <a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-"
"gnu.html\">GNU/Linux</a> for various reasons.  Many users switch for "
"practical reasons: because the system is powerful, because it is reliable, "
"or for the convenience of being able to change the software to do what you "
"need."

"The idea of the Free Software Movement is that computer users <a href=\"/"
"philosophy/why-free.html\">deserve the freedom to form a community</a>.  You "
"should have the freedom to help yourself, by changing the source code to do "
"whatever you need to do.  And the freedom to help your neighbor, by "
"redistributing copies of programs to other people.  Also the freedom to help "
"build your community, by publishing improved versions so that other people "
"can use them."

"Whether a program is free software depends mainly on its license.  However, "
"a program can also be non-free because you don't have access to its source "
"code, or because hardware won't let you put a modified version into use "
"(this is called &ldquo;tivoization&rdquo;)."

"Our <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">detailed definition</a> of free "
"software shows how we evaluate a license to see if it makes programs free "
"software.  We also have articles about <a href=\"/philosophy/essays-and-"
"articles.html#LicensingFreeSoftware\">certain specific licenses</a> "
"explaining the advantages and disadvantages of some licenses that do "

"In 1998 the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; was coined and associated with <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html\">views considerably "
"different from ours</a>.  These views cite only the practical advantages of "
"free software, and carefully avoid the deeper issues of freedom and social "
"solidarity that the Free Software Movement raises.  The idea of open source "
"is good as far as it goes, but it only scratches the surface of the issue.  "
"We don't mind working with supporters of open source on practical activities "
"such as software development, but we do not agree with their views, and we "
"decline to operate under their name."
