"The Free Software Foundation, represented by Professor Moglen of Columbia "
"University Law School, has participated in the W3 Consortium Patent Policy "
"Working Group from November 2001 through the present.  The current W3C "
"patent policy, which in most cases requires &ldquo;royalty-free&rdquo; or "
"&ldquo;RF&rdquo; patent licenses, is a significant step in the direction of "
"protecting the World Wide Web from patent-encumbered standards.  But it "
"falls short because a loophole allows conditions on these patent licenses "
"that would prohibit free software implementations of the standards."

"The problem comes from the &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions that "
"patent holders are allowed to put in their royalty-free patent licenses.  "
"Such restrictions say that you are allowed to practice the patented idea, "
"but only for implementing the standard precisely as specified &mdash; not in "
"any other way.  Thus, if you change the code to depart from the spec even "
"slightly, the patent license no longer protects you from against being sued "
"for infringing the patent."

"The W3C has policies to reject some kinds of &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; "
"restrictions.  For instance, it won't allow a patent license to be limited "
"to a certain kind of software or a certain kind of platform.  (We were "
"informed of this in 2012.)  However, that still allows other kinds of "
"restrictions that can cause a problem."

"One requirement for Free Software is that users have the freedom to modify "
"and redistribute it.  But we can hardly consider that users have freedom to "
"publish modified versions of the program if, for a part of the program's "
"behavior, modification is prohibited.  Thus, these &ldquo;field of "
"use&rdquo; restrictions would prevent implementation of W3C standards as <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\"> Free Software</a>."

"&ldquo;Field of use&rdquo; restrictions are also legally incompatible with "
"section 7 of the <a href=\"/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html\">GNU General "
"Public License (version 2)</a>, since it does not allow the user's freedom "
"to modify to be shrunk to zero in this way."

"Many other Free Software licenses have no provisions equivalent to the GPL's "
"Section 7, but you can't solve the problem merely by using one of those "
"licenses.  Section 7 is intended to prevent the imposition of side "
"restrictions (for instance, by patent licenses) which would deny the "
"freedoms that the GPL itself gives you.  If the software license does "
"nothing to prevent this, you can find yourself in a situation where the "
"program's license appears to give you freedom, but this freedom has been "
"taken away by restrictions not stated there."

"Freedom to modify software can always be limited by third-party patents in "
"ways that the software copyright license doesn't disclose.  This is why "
"software patents are <a href=\"http://swpat.ffii.org/\">so dangerous to "
"software freedom</a>."

"The FSF plans to continue to participate in the implementation process.  We "
"will try to convince patent-holders not to impose &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; "
"restrictions, and we encourage all those who care about the right of Free "
"Software developers to implement all future web standards to do the same."
