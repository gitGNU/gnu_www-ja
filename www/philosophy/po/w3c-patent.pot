"The Free Software Foundation, represented by Professor Moglen of Columbia "
"University Law School, has participated in the W3 Consortium Patent Policy "
"Working Group from November 2001 through the present.  The current W3C "
"patent policy, which in most cases requires &ldquo;royalty-free&rdquo; or "
"&ldquo;RF&rdquo; patent licenses, is a significant step in the direction of "
"protecting the World Wide Web from patent-encumbered standards.  But it "
"falls short because a loophole allows conditions on these patent licenses "
"that would prohibit free software implementations of the standards."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"The problem comes from the &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions that "
"patent holders are allowed to put in their royalty-free patent licenses.  "
"Such restrictions say that you are allowed to practice the patented idea, "
"but only for implementing the standard precisely as specified &mdash; not in "
"any other way.  Thus, if you change the code to depart from the spec even "
"slightly, the patent license no longer protects you from against being sued "
"for infringing the patent."

"One requirement for Free Software is that users have the freedom to modify "
"and redistribute it.  But we can hardly consider that users have freedom to "
"publish modified versions of the program if, for a part of the program's "
"behavior, modification is prohibited.  Thus, these &ldquo;field of "
"use&rdquo; restrictions would prevent implementation of W3C standards as <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\"> Free Software</a>."

"&ldquo;Field of use&rdquo; restrictions are also legally incompatible with "
"section 7 of the <a href=\"/licenses/gpl.html#TOC3\">GNU General Public "
"License</a>, since it does not allow the user's freedom to modify to be "
"shrunk to zero in this way."

"Many other Free Software licenses have no provisions equivalent to the GPL's "
"Section 7, but you can't solve the problem merely by using one of those "
"licenses.  Section 7 is intended to prevent the imposition of side "
"restrictions (for instance, by patent licenses) which would deny the "
"freedoms that the GPL itself gives you.  If the software license does "
"nothing to prevent this, you can find yourself in a situation where the "
"program's license appears to give you freedom, but this freedom has been "
"taken away by restrictions not stated there."

"For example, suppose the W3 obtains patent licenses for a standard "
"describing certain functionality in a web server.  One of the things you "
"should be able to do with a Free Software implementation of that standard is "
"to merge it into a web browser or a non-interactive web client, so as to "
"provide the same functionality there.  However, in this new context, the "
"code would not be implementing the specific standard for which the patent "
"was licensed, so the restriction that the patent is licensed only &ldquo;in "
"order to implement the standard&rdquo; would not be met.  Even reusing the "
"exact same code in the new context would face possible claims of patent "
"infringement."

"Freedom to modify software can always be limited by third-party patents in "
"ways that the software copyright license doesn't disclose.  This is why "
"software patents are <a href=\"http://swpat.ffii.org/\">so dangerous to "
"software freedom</a>.  The W3C, by allowing members of W3C working groups "
"that help to frame standards to impose restrictions on the modifiability of "
"code that implements those standards, is missing an opportunity to help "
"solve that problem, and may in specific cases even be helping to make the "
"problem worse."

"By allowing &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions, the proposed policy "
"falls short of protecting the rights of the Free Software community to fully "

"standards can be implemented in free software, has only been partially "
"achieved."

"The FSF plans to continue to participate in the implementation process.  We "

"The problem of &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions comes from <a "

"The problem is the interaction of such a &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; "
"restriction with <a href=\"/licenses/gpl.html#TOC3\">Section 7 of GPL</a>.  "
"Under Section 7, the &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction is a "
"&ldquo;conditions are imposed on you [the distributor of GPL'ed software] "
"that contradict the conditions of this License&rdquo;.  The "
"&ldquo;conditions of this license&rdquo; require, for example, that those "
"receiving distributions of GPL'ed software have the right to run the program "
"for any purpose (Section 0), the right to modify it for any purpose (Section "

"Here's a detailed step-by-step example that shows how this problem could "
"play out:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid ""
"Programmer <em>P</em> downloads the Konqueror web browser, receiving it "
"under terms of GPL."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid ""
"<em>P</em> learns of a new web standard that requires exercising a technique "
"for parsing URLs that is patented by Corporation <em>C</em>.  <em>C</em> has "
"licensed the patent under an RF, non-exclusive license, but with a "
"&ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction that says the license can be used to "
"&ldquo;implement the standard&rdquo;.  The standard, as it turns out, covers "
"only what browsers must do with URLs, and says nothing about the server side "
"or clients that aren't user browsers."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid ""
"<em>P</em> implements this technique in Konqueror, and seeks to redistribute "
"the modified version on his website so that other users can benefit from "
"Konqueror now complying with the standard.  If he does, he is bound by the "
"GPL under copyright law, because he is redistributing a modified version."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid ""
"However, he knows full well of a condition on that code that contradicts the "
"GPL (violating Section 7) &mdash; namely, he knows that <em>C</em>'s patent "
"license prohibits folks from taking his URL parsing code and putting it "
"into, say, a search engine.  Therefore, under GPL Section 7, he is "
"prohibited from redistribution."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ol><li>
msgid ""
"You might think that <em>P</em> can simply assign his copyright to the "
"existing copyright holder of Konqueror and let distribution happen from that "
"source.  They could distribute under the GPL, but they would be granting a "
"self-contradicting license.  Nothing prohibits someone from distributing "
"copyrighted works under licenses that make no sense and are "
"self-contradictory, but that is not free software.  Those who receive "
"distribution of those works are stuck, and can't undertake further "
"distribution or modification themselves."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Regardless of who makes the changes, the result either shuts down "
"distribution or forces the original developer to abandon the GPL (and the "
"program won't really be free even though its license looks free).  Both "
"outcomes are very unfortunate.  This is why we urge the community to "
"pressure patentholders not to use &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restrictions."
