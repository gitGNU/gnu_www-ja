"Many people think of Microsoft as the monster menace of the software "
"industry.  There is even a specific campaign to boycott Microsoft.  This "
"feeling has intensified since Microsoft expressed active hostility towards "
"free software."

"In the free software movement, our perspective is different.  We see that "
"Microsoft is doing something that mistreats software users: making software "
"<a href=\"/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware\"> proprietary</a> "
"and thus denying users their rightful freedom.  But Microsoft is not alone "
"in this; many other companies do the same thing to the users.  If other "
"companies manage to dominate fewer users than Microsoft, that is not for "
"lack of trying."

"This is not meant to excuse Microsoft.  Rather, it is meant as a reminder "
"that Microsoft is the natural development of a software industry based on <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/shouldbefree.html\">keeping users divided and subjugating "
"them</a>.  When criticizing Microsoft, we should not focus so narrowly on "
"Microsoft that we let other proprietary software developers off the hook."

"When we reject Microsoft's proprietary software, that is not a boycott.  The "
"word &ldquo;boycott&rdquo; means rejection, as a protest, of products that "
"are otherwise acceptable.  Rejecting a product because it hurts you is not a "
"boycott, just ordinary rationality.  To maintain your freedom, you need to "
"reject <em>all</em> proprietary software, regardless of who developed it or "
"who distributes it."

"There is no need to reject Microsoft non-software products, or services that "
"you can use without proprietary software.  (When you use a web service, "
"whether Microsoft's or not, watch out for <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/javascript-trap.html\">non-free JavaScript programs</a> "
"that it may try to slip into your browser.)  When Microsoft releases free "
"programs, which it occasionally does, they are acceptable in theory; but "
"most of them depend fundamentally on Microsoft proprietary software, which "
"we do need to reject, and that makes them useless for anyone that chooses to "
"live in freedom."

"In the &ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo;, leaked in October 1998, Microsoft "
"executives stated an intention to use various methods to obstruct the "
"development of free software: specifically, designing secret protocols and "
"file formats, and patenting algorithms and software features."

"These obstructionist policies were not new: Microsoft, and many other "
"software companies, had been doing them for years.  Secrecy and patents have "
"obstructed us greatly, and they may be more damaging in the future.  For the "
"most part, the companies' main motivation in doing these things is to attack "
"each other; now, it seems, we are specifically targeted.  Microsoft is using "
"its patents directly to <a "
"href=\"http://press.redhat.com/2009/09/09/microsoft-and-patent-trolls/\"> "
"attack the free software community</a>, and our community is fighting back."

"But Microsoft's patents are not the only patents that threaten us (and "
"software developers and users generally)&mdash;consider the harm that the "
"MP3 patent has done.  Thus, defending against specific attacks is necessary "
"but not sufficient.  The only full solution is to <a "
"href=\"http://endsoftpatents.org/\">eliminate software patents</a>."

"Other Microsoft practices specifically harmful to the adoption of free "
"software are the ones designed to build up social inertia that obstructs "
"migration to GNU/Linux.  For instance, when Microsoft &ldquo;donates&rdquo; "
"copies of Windows to schools, it converts these schools into tools for "
"implanting a dependence on Windows.  There are indications that Microsoft "
"systematically plans these activities <a "
"href=\"http://boycottnovell.com/wiki/index.php/EDGI\"> as a campaign against "
"the adoption of GNU/Linux</a>."

"Each Windows &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; augments Microsoft's power over the "
"users; Microsoft plans it that way.  And each one is a step forward in "
"malicious features, which include <a "
"href=\"http://DefectiveByDesign.org\">Digital Restrictions Management</a> "
"and back doors.  So the FSF runs campaigns to warn users against "
"&ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; to <a href=\"http://BadVista.org/\">Windows "
"Vista</a> and <a href=\"http://Windows7Sins.org\">Windows 7</a>.  We aim to "
"reduce the amount of inertia they will create."

"We don't hate Microsoft, and we don't consider it the Great Satan.  But we "
"do recognize it as the company that has separated more users from their "
"freedom than any other, and a powerful avowed enemy of computer users' "
"freedom.  We act accordingly."
