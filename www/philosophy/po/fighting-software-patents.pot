"Software patents are the software project equivalent of land mines: each "

"Developing a large and complex program means combining many ideas, often "
"hundreds or thousands of them. In a country that allows software patents, "
"chances are that some substantial fraction of the ideas in your program will "
"be patented already by various companies.  Perhaps hundreds of patents will "
"cover parts of your program. A study in 2004 found almost 300 US patents "
"that covered various parts of a single important program. It is so much work "
"to do such a study that only one has been done."

"Practically speaking, if you are a software developer, you will usually be "
"threatened by one patent at a time. When this happens, you may be able to "
"escape unscathed if you find legal grounds to overturn the patent. You may "
"as well try it; if you succeed, that will mean one less mine in the mine "
"field. If this patent is particularly threatening to the public, the <a "
"href=\"http://www.pubpat.org\">Public Patent Foundation (pubpat.org)</a> may "
"take up the case; that is its specialty. If you ask for the computer-using "
"community's help in searching for prior publication of the same idea, to use "
"as evidence to overturn a patent, we should all respond with whatever useful "
"information we might have."

"However, fighting patents one by one will never eliminate the danger of "
"software patents, any more than swatting mosquitos will eliminate "
"malaria. You cannot expect to defeat every patent that comes at you, any "
"more than you can expect to kill every monster in a video game: sooner or "
"later, one is going to defeat you and damage your program.  The US patent "
"office issues around a hundred thousand software patents each year; our best "
"efforts could never clear these mines as fast as they plant more."

"Some of these mines are impossible to clear. Every software patent is "
"harmful, and every software patent unjustly restricts how you use your "
"computer, but not every software patent is legally invalid according to the "
"patent system's criteria. The software patents we can overturn are those "
"that result from &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;, where the patent system's rules "
"were not properly carried out. There is nothing we can do when the only "
"relevant mistake was the policy of allowing software patents."

"To make a part of the castle safe, you've got to do more than kill the "
"monsters as they appear&mdash;you have to wipe out the generator that "
"produces them. Overturning existing patents one by one will not make "
"programming safe. To do that, we have to change the patent system so that "
"patents can no longer threaten software developers and users."

"There is no conflict between these two campaigns: we can work on the "
"short-term escape and the long-term fix at once. If we take care, we can "
"make our efforts to overturn individual software patents do double duty, "
"building support for efforts to correct the whole problem. The crucial point "
"is not to equate &ldquo;bad&rdquo; software patents with mistaken or invalid "
"software patents. Each time we invalidate one software patent, each time we "
"talk about our plans to try, we should say in no uncertain terms, &ldquo;One "
"less software patent, one less menace to programmers: the target is "
"zero.&rdquo;"

"The battle over software patents in the European Union is reaching a crucial "
"stage. The European Parliament voted a year ago to reject software patents "
"conclusively. In May, the Council of Ministers voted to undo the "
"Parliament's amendments and make the directive even worse than when it "
"started. However, at least one country that supported this has already "
"reversed its vote. We must all do our utmost right now to convince an "
"additional European country to change its vote, and to convince the newly "
"elected members of the European Parliament to stand behind the previous "
"vote. Please refer to <a href=\"http://www.ffii.org/\"> www.ffii.org</a> for "
"more information on how to help, and to get in touch with other activists."
