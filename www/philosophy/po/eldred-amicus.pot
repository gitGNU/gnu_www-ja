"North America, moreover, is unambiguous about the importance of "
"&ldquo;limited Times&rdquo; in the control of all state-awarded monopolies, "
"of which genus copyright and patent are species.  The very evils that led "
"English and British North American constitutional lawyers to insist on the "
"strictly limited term of royal and statutory monopolies, and to embody that "

"The words &ldquo;for limited Times&rdquo; appear in the Copyright Clause, "
"Article I, &#167;8, cl.&nbsp;8 as the result of long and bitter experience "
"with the constitutional evil of state-awarded monopolies.  From the "
"seventeenth century, the requirement of limitation in time was a basic "
"constitutional mechanism for dealing with the potential for abuse of power "
"inherent in the royal or statutory monopoly.  The use by Queen Elizabeth of "
"letters patent monopolizing certain trades as a means of raising money from "
"bidders for monopoly profits gave rise to the case of <i>Darcy</i> "
"v. <i>Allen</i>, (<i>The Case of Monopolies</i>), 11 Co. Rep. 84 (1603), in "
"which a royal patent monopoly on the making and distribution of playing "
"cards was held void.  Parliament followed in 1624 with the Statute of "
"Monopolies, 21 Jac.&nbsp;I, c.&nbsp;3, which declared that only Parliament "
"might grant statutory monopolies, limited to new inventions, for a period "
"not to exceed fourteen years.  <i>See</i> 4 William Blackstone, "
"<i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> *159 (1769).  This constitutional "
"limitation was evaded by Charles I during his period of despotic personal "
"rule; the resulting royal monopolies formed a significant grievance in the "
"years leading up to the English Civil War.  <i>See</i> Cecily Violet "

"As important as the principle of limited time is in the general restraint of "
"the harms that flow from statutory monopolies, in the area of copyright it "
"has an even more crucial purpose to serve.  The limited term of copyright "
"ensures the steady replenishment of the public domain, the vast repository "
"of the common culture of humankind.  The public domain is the springboard of "
"societal creativity, the zone of free reproduction and exchange that makes "
"innovation possible.  As Yochai Benkler has elegantly shown, the existence "
"of a vital and expanding public domain reconciles the exclusive rights of "
"the copyright system with the underlying goals of the system of free "
"expression protected by the First Amendment.  <i>See</i> Yochai Benkler, "
"<i>Free as the Air to Common Use: First Amendment Constraints on Enclosure "
"of the Public Domain</i>, 74 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 354, 386-394 (1999).  The Court "
"below erred in its facile dismissal of petitioners' First Amendment "
"concerns.  That Court first held in its opinion that the First Amendment's "
"requirements are &ldquo;categorically&rdquo; satisfied by the distinction "
"between expression and idea, and then that any material covered by copyright "
"but subject to the defense of fair use is therefore so copiously protected "

"The First Amendment abhors the vacuum of limited expression.  The making of "

"exacting scrutiny that protects our most fundamental freedoms.  The "
"Copyright Clause does not exempt the legislation enacted under it from such "
