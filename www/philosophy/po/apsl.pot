"The Apple Public Source License (APSL) version 2.0 qualifies as a free "
"software license.  Apple's lawyers worked with the FSF to produce a license "
"that would qualify.  The <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/historical-apsl.html\">problems previously described on "
"this page</a> are still potential issues for other possible licenses, but "
"they do not apply to version 2.0 of the APSL.  We encourage everyone who "
"uses any version of Apple Software under the APSL to use the terms of "
"version 2.0 rather than that of any earlier license."

"In version 2.0 of the APSL, the definition of &ldquo;Externally "
"Deployed&rdquo; has been narrowed in a way that is appropriate for the "
"respect of users' freedoms.  It has always been the position of FSF that the "
"freedom of Free Software is primarily for the users of that software.  "
"Technologies, like web applications, are changing the way that users "
"interact with software.  The APSL 2.0, like the <a "
"href=\"/licenses/agpl.html\">GNU Affero GPL</a>, seeks to defend the freedom "
"of those who use software in these novel ways, without unduly hindering the "
"users' privacy nor freedom to use the software."

"Aside from this, we must remember that only part of Mac OS X is being "
"released under the APSL.  Even though the fatal flaws of the APSL were "
"fixed, and even if the practical problems were addressed, that does no good "
"for the other parts of Mac OS X whose source code is not being released at "
