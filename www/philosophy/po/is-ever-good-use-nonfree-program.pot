"If you recommend that others run the nonfree program, or lead them to do so, "
"you're leading them to give up their freedom. Thus, we have a responsibility "
"not to lead or encourage others to run nonfree software.  Where the program "
"uses a secret protocol for communication, as in the case of Skype, your own "
"use of it pressures others to use it too, so it is especially important to "
"avoid any use of these programs."

"But there is one special case where using some nonfree software, and even "
"urging others to use it, can be a positive thing. That's when the use of the "
"nonfree software aims directly at putting an end to the use of that very "
"same nonfree software."

"In 1983 I decided to develop the GNU operating system, as a free replacement "
"for Unix. The feasible way to do it was to write and test the components one "
"by one on Unix. But was it legitimate to use Unix for this? And was it "
"legitimate to ask others to use Unix for this, given that Unix was "
"proprietary software? (Of course, if it had not been proprietary, it would "
"not have required replacing.)"

"The conclusion I reached was that using Unix to put an end to the use of "
"Unix was legitimate for me to suggest to other developers.  I likened it to "
"participating in small ways in some evil activity, such as a criminal gang "
"or a dishonest political campaign, in order to expose it and shut it "
"down. While participating in the activity is wrong in itself, shutting it "
"down excuses minor peripheral participation, comparable to merely using "
"Unix. This argument would not justify being a ringleader, but I was only "
"considering using Unix, not going to work for its development team."

"The job of replacing Unix was completed when the last essential component "
"was replaced by Linux, the kernel started by Linus Torvalds in 1991. We "
"still add to the GNU/Linux system, but that doesn't require using Unix, so "
"it isn't a reason for using Unix&mdash;not any more. Thus, whenever you're "
"using a nonfree program for this sort of reason, you should reconsider from "
"time to time whether the need still exists."

"However, there are other nonfree programs we still need to replace, and the "
"analogous question often arises. Should you run the nonfree driver for a "
"peripheral to help you develop a free replacement driver? (More precisely, "
"is it ethical for us to suggest that you do so?)  Yes, by all means. Is it "
"ok to run the <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html\">nonfree "
"JavaScript</a> on a web site in order to file complaint asking the "
"webmasters to free that JavaScript code, or make the site work without it? "
"Definitely&mdash;but other than that, you should have <a "
"href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/\">LibreJS</a> block it for you."

"But this justification won't stretch any further. People that develop "
"nonfree software, even software with malicious functionalities, often try to "
"excuse this on the grounds that they fund some development of free "
"software. However, a business that is basically wrong can't be legitimized "
"by spending some of the profits on a worthy cause. For instance, some (not "
"all) of the activities of the Gates Foundation are laudable, but they don't "
"excuse Bill Gates's career, or Microsoft. If the business works directly "
"against the worthy cause it tries to legitimize itself with, that is a "
"self-contradiction and it undermines the cause."

"Even using a nonfree program to develop free software in general is better "
"to avoid, and not suggest to others. For instance, we should not ask people "
"to run Windows or MacOS in order to make free applications run on them. As "
"developer of Emacs and GCC, I accepted changes to make them support nonfree "
"systems such as VMS, Windows and MacOS.  I had no reason to reject that "
"code, even though people had run nonfree systems to write it.  Their use of "
"unjust systems was not at my request or suggestion; rather, they were "
"already using them before starting to write changes for GNU.  They also did "
"the packaging of releases for those systems."

"The &ldquo;developing its own replacement&rdquo; exception is valid within "
"its limits, and crucial for the progress of free software, but we must "
"resist stretching it any further lest it turn into an all-purpose excuse for "
"any profitable activity with nonfree software."

"Occasionally it is necessary to use and even upgrade a nonfree system on a "
"machine in order to install a free system to replace it on that machine.  "
"This is not exactly the same issue, but the same arguments apply: it is "
"legitimate to recommend running some nonfree software momentarily in order "
"to remove it."

"Footnote: Using the nonfree program can have unfortunate indirect effects, "
"such as rewarding the perpetrator and encouraging more use of that program.  "
"This is a further reason to shun use of nonfree programs."

"Most proprietary programs come with an End User License Agreement that "
"hardly anyone reads.  Tucked away in it, in most cases, is an unethical "
"commitment to behave like an uncooperative, bad neighbor.  It claims you "
"promised not to distribute copies to others, or even lend someone a copy."

"To carry out such a commitment is more wrong than to break it.  No matter "
"what legalistic arguments they might make, the developers can hardly claim "
"their shady trick gives users a moral obligation to be uncooperative."

"However, we think that the truly moral path is to carefully reject such "
