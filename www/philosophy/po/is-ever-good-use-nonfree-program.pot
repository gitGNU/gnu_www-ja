"If you run a nonfree program on your computer, it denies your freedom; the "
"main one harmed is you. Your usage of it can harm others indirectly, by "
"encouraging development of that nonfree program. If you make a promise not "
"to redistribute the program to others, you do wrong, because breaking such a "
"promise is bad and keeping it is worse.  Still, the main direct harm is to "
"you."

"It is even worse if you recommend that others run the nonfree program, or "
"lead them to do so. When you do that, you're leading them to give up their "
"freedom. Thus, what we should avoid most firmly is leading or encouraging "
"others to run nonfree software. (Where the program uses a secret protocol "
"for communication, as in the case of Skype, your own use of it pressures "
"others to use it too, so it is especially important to reject any use of "
"these programs.)"

"But there is one special case where using some nonfree software, and even "
"urging others to use it, can be a positive thing. That's when the use of the "
"nonfree software aims directly at putting an end to the use of that very "
"same nonfree software."

"In 1983 I decided to develop the GNU operating system, as a free replacement "
"for Unix. The feasible way to do it was to write and test the components one "
"by one on Unix. But was it legitimate to use Unix for this? And was it "
"legitimate to ask others to use Unix for this, given that Unix was "
"proprietary software? Of course, if it had not been proprietary, it would "
"not have required replacing."

"The conclusion I reached was that using Unix to put an end to the use of "
"Unix was legitimate. I likened it to participating in small ways in some "
"other evil activity, such as a criminal gang or a dishonest political "
"campaign, in order to expose it and shut it down. While participating in the "
"activity is wrong in itself, shutting it down excuses minor peripheral "
"participation, comparable to merely using Unix. This argument would not "
"justify being a ringleader, but I was only considering using Unix, not going "
"to work for its development team."

"The job of replacing Unix was completed when the last essential component "
"was replaced by Linux, the kernel started by Linus Torvalds in 1991. We "
"still add to the GNU/Linux system, but that doesn't require using Unix, so "
"it isn't a reason for using Unix&mdash;not any more. Thus, whenever you're "
"using a nonfree program for this sort of reason, you should reconsider from "
"time to time whether the need still exists."

"However, there are other nonfree programs we still need to replace, and the "
"analogous question often arises. Should you run the nonfree driver for a "
"peripheral to help you develop a free replacement driver? Yes, by all "
"means. Is it ok to run the <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html\">nonfree "
"JavaScript</a> on a web site in order to file complaint asking the "
"webmasters to free that JavaScript code, or make the site work without it? "
"Definitely&mdash;but other than that, you should have <a "
"href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/\">LibreJS</a> block it for you."

"But this justification won't stretch any further. People that develop "
"nonfree software, even software with malicious functionalities, often try to "
"excuse this on the grounds that they fund some development of free "
"software. However, a business that is basically wrong can't be legitimized "
"by spending some of the profits on a worthy cause. For instance, some (not "
"all) of the activities of the Gates Foundation are laudable, but they don't "
"excuse Bill Gates's career, or Microsoft. If the business works directly "
"against the worthy cause it tries to legitimize itself with, that is a "
"self-contradiction and it undermines the cause."

"Even using a nonfree program to develop free software in general is better "
"to avoid. For instance, we should not ask people to run Windows or MacOS in "
"order to make free applications run on them. As developer of Emacs and GCC, "
"I accepted changes to make them support nonfree systems such as VMS, Windows "
"and MacOS. There was no reason to reject that code, but I did not ask people "
"to run nonfree systems in order to develop it. The changes came from people "
"who were using those systems anyway."

"The &ldquo;developing its own replacement&rdquo; exception is valid within "
"its limits, and crucial for the progress of free software, but we must "
"resist stretching it any further lest it turn into an all-purpose excuse for "
"any profitable activity with nonfree software."
