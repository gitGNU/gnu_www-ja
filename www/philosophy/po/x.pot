"To copyleft or not to copyleft? That is one of the major controversies in "
"the free software community.  The idea of copyleft is that we should fight "
"fire with fire&mdash;that we should use copyright to make sure our code "
"stays free.  The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) is one example of a "
"copyleft license."

"Some free software developers prefer noncopyleft distribution.  Noncopyleft "
"licenses such as the XFree86 and <a href=\"/philosophy/bsd.html\">BSD</a> "
"licenses are based on the idea of never saying no to anyone&mdash;not even "
"to someone who seeks to use your work as the basis for restricting other "
"people.  Noncopyleft licensing does nothing wrong, but it misses the "
"opportunity to actively protect our freedom to change and redistribute "
"software.  For that, we need copyleft."

"For many years, the X Consortium was the chief opponent of copyleft.  It "
"exerted both moral suasion and pressure to discourage free software "
"developers from copylefting their programs.  It used moral suasion by "
"suggesting that it is not nice to say no.  It used pressure through its rule "
"that copylefted software could not be in the X Distribution."

"Why did the X Consortium adopt this policy? It had to do with their "
"conception of success.  The X Consortium defined success as "
"popularity&mdash;specifically, getting computer companies to use the X "
"Window System.  This definition put the computer companies in the driver's "
"seat: whatever they wanted, the X Consortium had to help them get it."

"Computer companies normally distribute proprietary software.  They wanted "
"free software developers to donate their work for such use.  If they had "
"asked for this directly, people would have laughed.  But the X Consortium, "
"fronting for them, could present this request as an unselfish one.  "
"&ldquo;Join us in donating our work to proprietary software "
"developers,&rdquo; they said, suggesting that this is a noble form of "
"self-sacrifice.  &ldquo;Join us in achieving popularity,&rdquo; they said, "
"suggesting that it was not even a sacrifice."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"But self-sacrifice is not the issue: tossing away the defense that copyleft "
"provides, which protects the freedom of the whole community, is sacrificing "
"more than yourself.  Those who granted the X Consortium's request entrusted "
"the community's future to the goodwill of the X Consortium."

"This trust was misplaced.  In its last year, the X Consortium made a plan to "
"restrict the forthcoming X11R6.4 release so that it would not be free "
"software.  They decided to start saying no, not only to proprietary software "
"developers, but to our community as well."

"There is an irony here.  If you said yes when the X Consortium asked you not "
"to use copyleft, you put the X Consortium in a position to license and "
"restrict its version of your program, along with the code for the core of X."

"The X Consortium did not carry out this plan.  Instead it closed down and "
"transferred X development to the Open Group, whose staff are now carrying "
"out a similar plan.  To give them credit, when I asked them to release "
"X11R6.4 under the GNU GPL in parallel with their planned restrictive "
"license, they were willing to consider the idea.  (They were firmly against "
"staying with the old X11 distribution terms.)  Before they said yes or no to "
"this proposal, it had already failed for another reason: the XFree86 group "
"followed the X Consortium's old policy, and will not accept copylefted "
"software."

"In September 1998, several months after X11R6.4 was released with nonfree "
"distribution terms, the Open Group reversed its decision and rereleased it "
"under the same noncopyleft free software license that was used for X11R6.3.  "
"Thus, the Open Group therefore eventually did what was right, but that does "
"not alter the general issue."

"Even if the X Consortium and the Open Group had never planned to restrict X, "
"someone else could have done it.  Noncopylefted software is vulnerable from "
"all directions; it lets anyone make a nonfree version dominant, if he will "
"invest sufficient resources to add significantly important features using "
"proprietary code.  Users who choose software based on technical "
"characteristics, rather than on freedom, could easily be lured to the "
"nonfree version for short-term convenience."

"The X Consortium and Open Group can no longer exert moral suasion by saying "

"When you work on the core of X, on programs such as the X server, Xlib, and "
"Xt, there is a practical reason not to use copyleft.  The X.org group does "
"an important job for the community in maintaining these programs, and the "
"benefit of copylefting our changes would be less than the harm done by a "
"fork in development.  So it is better to work with them, and not copyleft "
"our changes on these programs.  Likewise for utilities such as <tt>xset</tt> "
"and <tt>xrdb</tt>, which are close to the core of X and do not need major "
"improvements.  At least we know that the X.org group has a firm commitment "
"to developing these programs as free software."

"The issue is different for programs outside the core of X: applications, "
"window managers, and additional libraries and widgets.  There is no reason "

"In case anyone feels the pressure exerted by the criteria for inclusion in "
"the X distributions, the GNU Project will undertake to publicize copylefted "

"At the same time, it is better if we do not feel too much need for "
"popularity.  When a businessman tempts you with &ldquo;more "
"popularity,&rdquo; he may try to convince you that his use of your program "
"is crucial to its success.  Don't believe it! If your program is good, it "
"will find many users anyway; you don't need to feel desperate for any "
"particular users, and you will be stronger if you do not.  You can get an "
"indescribable sense of joy and freedom by responding, &ldquo;Take it or "
"leave it&mdash;that's no skin off my back.&rdquo; Often the businessman will "
"turn around and accept the program with copyleft, once you call the bluff."

"Friends, free software developers, don't repeat old mistakes! If we do not "
