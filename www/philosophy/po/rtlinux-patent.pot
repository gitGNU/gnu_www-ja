"The Free Software Foundation and Finite State Machine Labs Inc.  (FSMLabs) "
"today announced the release of the Open RTLinux patent license Version 2 "
"fully compliant with the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public "
"License (GNU GPL).  The Open Patent License grants the right to use "
"U.S. Patent No. 5,995,745 in GPL-covered free software without payment of a "
"royalty.  This license protects GPL use of the RTLinux process."

"FSMLabs and FSF expect the release of this license to accelerate the rate of "
"the free software revolution in the fields of embedded and realtime "
"computing.  These areas have been isolated from the mainstream of progress "
"in software development by proprietary software based on secrets and "
"incompatibilities designed to lock customers into proprietary technology.  "
"The availability of superior free software has already lead to many "
"innovative projects from large corporations thousands of individuals and "
"small companies all over the world.  FSF thanks FSMLabs for its continuing "
"contributions to the free software community."

"The Free Software Foundation and Finite State Machine Labs (FSMLAbs) have "
"come to an agreement on a fully GPL-compliant version of FSMLabs RTLinux "
"Open Patent License.  FSF and FSMLabs are working to finalize the license "
"language; FSMLabs will be publishing on its website the text of that "
"license, with a statement by FSF confirming its GPL-compliant status, in the "
"very near future.  FSF has already withdrawn its press statement issued "
"Friday September 14 concerning RTLinux license terms.  Our differences "
"turned out to be mostly a result of unfortunate miscommunications and we "
"urge everyone to put this dispute behind them.  FSF and FSMLabs expect to "
"continue their cooperation to secure availability of FSMLabs patented "
"technology for use in GNU/Linux systems.  The FSF thanks FSMLabs for its "
"contribution of this patent license to the free software community, and for "
"its longstanding support and publication of free software under the GPL."
