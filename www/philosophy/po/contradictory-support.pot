"It's possible that they do some <em>other</em> things that really support "
"free software, but those classes certainly don't.  On the contrary, they "
"work directly against the free software movement by promoting the use of the "
"nonfree software.  That increases the magnitude of the practical problem it "
"is our mission to correct."

"Even worse, that grants nonfree software legitimacy.  The basic point of the "
"free software movement is that nonfree software is <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html\">unjust</a> and "
"should not exist.  That's why we need a movement to <em>replace and "
"eliminate</em> it.  Teaching how to use it asserts that it isn't a problem; "
"that opposes the free software movement at the deepest level."

"Of course, people have the right to state that view, but they shouldn't "

"Even more outrageously, some of those organizations claim that their courses "
"in using nonfree software are connected with or even certified by the GNU "
"Project or the Free Software Foundation.  Needless to say, we would never "
"certify such a course, nor recommend it, nor have anything to do with it, "
"nor even talk about it except with condemnation."

"Teaching use of nonfree programs works against free software; teaching it in "
"association with the name GNU or the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo; causes "
"confusion about what we stand for."

"If you encounter such an organization, please explain these points to the "
"people who work on it: that such courses go directly against the principles "
"of the free software movement.  Explain to them why, if they want to help "
"the free software cause, they need to teach people to choose free software, "
"not legitimize nonfree software."
