"If the House Un-American Activities Committee asked me, &ldquo;Are you now "
"or have you ever been a supporter of the open source movement,&rdquo; I "
"could proudly and cheerfully say no.  I've been campaigning since 1984 for "
"<em>free software</em>&mdash;free as in freedom.  (See the GNU Manifesto, "
"Dr. Dobb's Journal, Sept. 1985.)"

"Free software means, roughly, that you are free to study what it does, free "
"to change it, free to redistribute it, and free to publish improved "
"versions.  (See <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a> "
"for more details.)  You deserve these freedoms; everyone deserves them.  I "
"wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), the target of <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/gpl-american-way.html\">Microsoft's greatest ire</a>, to "
"defend these freedoms for all users, in the spirit of the free software "
"movement."

"Years later, in 1998, another group began operating under the term "
"&ldquo;open source&rdquo;.  They have contributed to the free software "
"community in practical ways, but they stand for very different views.  They "
"studiously avoid the issues of freedom and principle that we raise in the "
"free software movement; they cite only short-term practical benefits as the "
"reasons for what they do."

"Their stated definition for the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; is somewhat "
"broader than free software, and thus includes my work.  But describing the "
"GNU GPL as an &ldquo;open source license,&rdquo; as Microsoft did, is more "
"than half misleading.  The GNU GPL embodies the firm philosophy of the free "
"software movement; it doesn't come from the open source movement.  I am not "
"a supporter of the open source movement, and never have been."

"Tim O'Reilly, by contrast, is a pillar of the open source movement, at least "
"to hear him tell it.  However, if you look at actions rather than words, "
"most of the manuals published by O'Reilly Associates do not qualify as open "
"source, let alone as free.  The handful of free titles are exceptions.  He "
"could easily excuse himself to <abbr title=\"House Un-American Activities "
"Committee\">HUAC</abbr>&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I talked about open source, but I "
"didn't really do much of it.&rdquo;"

"If O'Reilly moves to selling free-as-in-freedom books in the future, he "
"could become a true supporter of the free software movement, or at least the "
"open source movement.  [Later in 2001, O'Reilly Associates published a "
"couple of additional free books.  We are grateful for this contribution to "
"the free software community, and we look forward to more of the same.]"
