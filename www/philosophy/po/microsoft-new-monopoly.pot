"Leaked internal documents in 1998 said that Microsoft considered the free "

"Because Microsoft has so much market power, it can often impose new "
"standards at will. It need only patent some minor idea, design a file "
"format, programming language, or communication protocol based on it, and "
"then pressure users to adopt it. Then we in the free software community will "
"be forbidden to provide software that does what these users want; they will "
"be locked in to Microsoft, and we will be locked out from serving them."

"Previously Microsoft tried to get its patented scheme for spam blocking "

"Several years ago, Microsoft abandoned its documented format for saving "
"documents, and switched to a new format which was secret.  However, the "
"developers of free software word processors such as AbiWord and "
"OpenOffice.org experimented assiduously for years to figure out the format, "

"The next version of Microsoft Word will use formats that involve a technique "
"that Microsoft claims to hold a patent on. Microsoft offers a royalty-free "
"patent license for certain limited purposes, but it is so limited that it "
"does not allow free software. You can see the license here: <a "

"Free software is defined as software that respects four fundamental "
"freedoms: (0) freedom to run the software as you wish, (1) freedom to study "
"the source code and modify it to do what you wish, (2) freedom to make and "
"redistribute copies, and (3) freedom to publish modified versions. Only "
"programmers can directly exercise freedoms 1 and 3, but all users can "
"exercise freedoms 0 and 2, and all users benefit from the modifications that "
"programmers write and publish."

"Distributing an application under Microsoft's patent license imposes license "
"terms that prohibit most possible modifications of the software. Lacking "
"freedom 3, the freedom to publish modified versions, it would not be free "
"software. (I think it could not be &ldquo;open source&rdquo; software "
"either, since that definition is similar; but it is not identical, and I "
"cannot speak for the advocates of open source.)"

"The Microsoft license also requires inclusion of a specific statement. That "
"requirement would not in itself prevent the program from being free: it is "
"normal for free software to carry license notices that cannot be changed, "
"and this statement could be included in one of them. The statement is biased "
"and confusing, since it uses the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;; "
"fortunately, one is not required to endorse the statement as true or even "
"meaningful, only to include it. The software developer could cancel its "
"misleading effect with a disclaimer like this: &ldquo;The following "
"misleading statement has been imposed on us by Microsoft; please be advised "
"that it is propaganda. See <a href=\"/philosophy/not-ipr.html\"> "

"However, the requirement to include a fixed piece of text is actually quite "
"cunning, because anyone who does so has explicitly accepted and applied the "
"restrictions of the Microsoft patent license. The resulting program is "
"clearly not free software."

"Some free software licenses, such as the most popular GNU General Public "
"License (GNU GPL), forbid publication of a modified version if it isn't free "
"software in the same way. (We call that the &ldquo;liberty or death&rdquo; "
"clause, since it ensures the program will remain free or die.) To apply "
"Microsoft's license to a program under the GNU GPL would violate the "
"program's license; it would be illegal. Many other free software licenses "
"permit nonfree modified versions. It wouldn't be illegal to modify such a "
"program and publish the modified version under Microsoft's patent "
"license. But that modified version, with its modified license, wouldn't be "
"free software."

"Microsoft's patent covering the new Word format is a US patent.  It doesn't "
"restrict anyone in Europe; Europeans are free to make and use software that "
"can read this format. Europeans that develop or use software currently enjoy "
"an advantage over Americans: Americans can be sued for patent infringement "
"for their software activities in the US, but the Europeans cannot be sued "
"for their activities in Europe. Europeans can already get US software "
"patents and sue Americans, but Americans cannot get European software "
"patents if Europe doesn't allow them."

"All that will change if the European Parliament authorizes software "
"patents. Microsoft will be one of thousands of foreign software patent "
"holders that will bring their patents over to Europe to sue the software "
"developers and computer users there. Of the 50,000-odd putatively invalid "
"software patents issued by the European Patent Office, around 80 percent do "
"not belong to Europeans. The European Parliament should vote to keep these "
"patents invalid, and keep Europeans safe."
