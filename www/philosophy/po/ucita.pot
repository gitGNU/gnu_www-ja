"UCITA is a proposed law, designed by the proprietary software developers, "
"who are now asking all 50 states of the US to adopt it.  If UCITA is "
"adopted, it will threaten the free software community <a "
"href=\"#Note1\">(1)</a> with disaster.  To understand why, please read on."

"We generally believe that big companies ought to be held to a strict "
"standard of liability to their customers, because they can afford it and "
"because it will keep them honest.  On the other hand, individuals, amateurs, "
"and good samaritans should be treated more favorably."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"UCITA does exactly the opposite.  It makes individuals, amateurs, and good "
"samaritans liable, but not big companies."

"You see, UCITA says that by default a software developer or distributor is "
"completely liable for flaws in a program; but it also allows a shrink-wrap "
"license to override the default.  Sophisticated software companies that make "
"proprietary software will use shrink-wrap licenses to avoid liability "
"entirely.  But amateurs, and self-employed contractors who develop software "
"for others, will often be shafted because they didn't know about this "
"problem.  And we free software developers won't have any reliable way to "
"avoid the problem."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"What could we do about this? We could try to change our licenses to avoid "
"it.  But since we don't use shrink-wrap licenses, we cannot override the "
"UCITA default.  Perhaps we can prohibit distribution in the states that "
"adopt UCITA.  That might solve the problem&mdash;for the software we release "
"in the future.  But we can't do this retroactively for software we have "
"already released.  Those versions are already available, people are already "
"licensed to distribute them in these states&mdash;and when they do so, under "
"UCITA, they would make us liable.  We are powerless to change this situation "
"by changing our licenses now; we will have to make complex legal arguments "
"that may or may not work."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>

"UCITA has another indirect consequence that would hamstring free software "
"development in the long term&mdash;it gives proprietary software developers "
"the power to prohibit reverse engineering.  This would make it easy for them "
"to establish secret file formats and protocols, which there would be no "
"lawful way for us to figure out."
msgstr ""

"That could be a disastrous obstacle for development of free software that "
"can serve users' practical needs, because communicating with users of "
"non-free software is one of those needs.  Many users today feel that they "
"must run Windows, simply so they can read and write files in Word format.  "
"Microsoft's &ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo; announced a plan to use secret "
"formats and protocols as a weapon to obstruct the development of the "
"GNU/Linux system <a href=\"#Note2\">(2)</a>."

"Precisely this kind of restriction is now being used in Norway to prosecute "
"16-year-old Jon Johansen, who figured out the format of DVDs to make it "
"possible to write free software to play them on free operating systems.  "

"Some friends of free software have argued that UCITA would benefit our "
"community, by making non-free software intolerably restrictive, and thus "
"driving users to us.  Realistically speaking, this is unlikely, because it "
"assumes that proprietary software developers will act against their own "
"interests.  They may be greedy and ruthless, but they are not stupid."

"Proprietary software developers intend to use the additional power UCITA "
"would give them to increase their profits.  Rather than using this power at "
"full throttle all the time, they will make an effort to find the most "
"profitable way to use it.  Those applications of UCITA power that make users "
"stop buying will be abandoned; those that most users tolerate will become "
"the norm.  UCITA will not help us."

"UCITA does not apply only to software.  It applies to any sort of "
"computer-readable information.  Even if you use only free software, you are "
"likely to read articles on your computer, and access data bases.  UCITA will "
"allow the publishers to impose the most outrageous restrictions on you.  "
"They could change the license retroactively at any time, and force you to "
"delete the material if you don't accept the change.  They could even "
"prohibit you from describing what you see as flaws in the material."

"This is too outrageous an injustice to wish on anyone, even if it would "
"indirectly benefit a good cause.  As ethical beings, we must not favor the "
"infliction of hardship and injustice on others on the grounds that it will "
"drive them to join our cause.  We must not be Machiavellian.  The point of "
"free software is concern for each other."
