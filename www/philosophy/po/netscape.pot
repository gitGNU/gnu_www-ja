"That is getting a bit ahead of events.  The announcement Netscape made does "
"not actually say that they will use the GNU GPL, and does not assert that "
"the program will be <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a> "
"as we define it in our community.  It's clear that Netscape will take a big "
"step in the direction of free software, but we don't know whether they will "
"get all the way there or fall substantially short.  In fact, Netscape is "
"still deciding what to do."

"When they decide, two crucial questions will be whether people will be free "
"to distribute copies for a fee (on free software CD-ROM collections, for "
"example) and whether people will be free to redistribute modified versions "
"just like the original version.  If either of those freedoms is lacking, the "
"program won't be free software."

"If Netscape does release the Netscape browser as free software, that will be "
"a great day for the free software movement.  But rather than rejoicing or "
"criticizing now, let's see what actually happens, and then we'll know "
"whether to celebrate.  What we can usefully do now is urge Netscape, calmly "
"and politely, to make the software free, and to copyleft it with the <a "
"href=\"/copyleft/gpl.html\">GNU General Public License</a>."
