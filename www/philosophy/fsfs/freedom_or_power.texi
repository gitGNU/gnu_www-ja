In the Free Software Movement, we stand for freedom for the users of software. We formulated 
our views by looking at what freedoms are necessary for a good way of
life, and permit useful programs to foster a community of goodwill, cooperation, and 
collaboration. Our criteria for Free Software specify the freedoms that a program's
users need so that they can cooperate in a community. 

We stand for freedom for programmers as well as for other users. Most of us are programmers, 
and we want freedom for ourselves as well as for you. But each of us uses
software written by others, and we want freedom when using that software, not just when using 
our own code. We stand for freedom for all users, whether they program
often, occasionally, or not at all. 

However, one so-called freedom that we do not advocate is the ''freedom to choose any license 
you want for software you write''. We reject this because it is really a form
of power, not a freedom. 

This oft-overlooked distinction is crucial. Freedom is being able to make decisions that 
affect mainly you. Power is being able to make decisions that affect others more
than you. If we confuse power with freedom, we will fail to uphold real freedom. 

Proprietary software is an exercise of power. Copyright law today grants software developers 
that power, so they and only they choose the rules to impose on everyone
else--a relatively few people make the basic software decisions for everyone, typically by 
denying their freedom. When users lack the freedoms that define Free Software,
they can't tell what the software is doing, can't check for back doors, can't monitor possible 
viruses and worms, can't find out what personal information is being reported
(or stop the reports, even if they do find out). If it breaks, they can't fix it; they have to 
wait for the developer to exercise its power to do so. If it simply isn't quite what
they need, they are stuck with it. They can't help each other improve it. 

Proprietary software developers are often businesses. We in the Free Software Movement are not 
opposed to business, but we have seen what happens when a software
business has the ''freedom'' to impose arbitrary rules on the users of software. Microsoft is an 
egregious example of how denying users' freedoms can lead to direct harm,
but it is not the only example. Even when there is no monopoly, proprietary software harms 
society. A choice of masters is not freedom. 

Discussions of rights and rules for software have often concentrated on the interests of 
programmers alone. Few people in the world program regularly, and fewer still are
owners of proprietary software businesses. But the entire developed world now needs and uses 
software, so software developers now control the way the world lives, does
business, communicates and is entertained. The ethical and political issues are not addressed 
by the slogan of ''freedom of choice (for developers only)''. 

If code is law, as Professor Lawrence Lessig (of Stanford Law School) has stated, then the real 
question we face is: who should control the code you use--you, or an elite
few? We believe you are entitled to control the software you use, and giving you that control 
is the goal of Free Software. 

We believe you should decide what to do with the software you use; however, that is not what 
today's law says. Current copyright law places us in the position of power
over users of our code, whether we like it or not. The ethical response to this situation is 
to proclaim freedom for each user, just as the Bill of Rights was supposed to
exercise government power by guaranteeing each citizen's freedoms. That is what the GNU GPL 
is for: it puts you in control of your usage of the software, while
protecting you from others who would like to take control of your decisions. 

As more and more users realize that code is law, and come to feel that they too deserve freedom, 
they will see the importance of the freedoms we stand for, just as more
and more users have come to appreciate the practical value of the Free Software we have developed.
