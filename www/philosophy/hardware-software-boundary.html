<h2>The Boundary Between Hardware And Software</h2>

<p>What is the boundary, in digital devices, between hardware and
software?  We can find it by applying the definitions: software is the
operational part of a device that can be copied and changed in a
computer; hardware is the operational part that can't be.  This is the
right way to make the distinction because it relates to the practical
consequences.</p>

<p>Between hardware and software there is a gray area consisting of
firmware that <em>can</em> be upgraded or replaced, but is not meant
to be upgraded or replaced once the product is sold.  In
conceptual terms, the gray area is rather narrow.  In practice, it is
important because many products fall in it.  We can treat that
firmware as hardware with a small stretch.</p>

<p>Some have said that preinstalled firmware programs and
Field-Programmable Gate Array chips (FPGAs) &ldquo;blur the boundary
between hardware and software,&rdquo; but I think that is a
misinterpretation of the facts.  Firmware that is installed during use
is software; firmware that is delivered inside the device and can't be changed
is software by nature, but we can treat it as if it were a circuit.
As for FPGAs, the FPGA itself is hardware, but the gate pattern that
is loaded into the FPGA is a kind of firmware.</p>

<p>Running free gate patterns on FPGAs could potentially be a useful
method for making digital devices that are free at the circuit level.
However, to make FPGAs usable in the free world, we need free
development tools for them.  The obstacle is that the format of the
gate pattern file that gets loaded into the FPGA is secret.  Until
recently there was <em>no</em> model of FPGA for which those files
could be produced without nonfree (proprietary) tools.</p>

<p>Thanks to a reverse-engineering effort, it is now possible to compile
C programs and run them on the Xilinx Spartan 6 LX9 FPGA.  The tools
do not yet support HDL (hardware definition language) code, though, so
this does not offer a usable substitute for real digital chips.
Meanwhile, that model of FPGA is starting to get old.  These tools
constitute a tremendous advance over the situation a few years ago,
but there's a long way to go before FPGAs are fully usable in freedom.</p>

<p>As for the HDL code itself, it can act as software (when it is run on
an emulator or loaded into an FPGA) or as a hardware design (when it
is realized in immutable silicon or a circuit board).</p>
