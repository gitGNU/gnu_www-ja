<h2>Proprietary Back Doors</h2>

<a href="/philosophy/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Here are examples of demonstrated back doors in proprietary software.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>Most mobile phones have a universal back door, which has been used to 
<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/22/nsa_can_reportedly_track_cellphones_even_when_they_re_turned_off.html">
turn them malicious</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/18/chinese-android-phones-coolpad-hacker-backdoor">
A Chinese version of Android has a universal back door</a>. Nearly all 
models of mobile phones have a universal back door in the modem chip. So 
why did Coolpad bother to introduce another? Because this one is controlled 
by Coolpad.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Microsoft Windows has a universal back door through which
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201806263">
any change whatsoever can be imposed on the users</a>.
</p>
<p>More information on when
<a href="http://slated.org/windows_by_stealth_the_updates_you_dont_want">
this was used</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Windows 8's back doors are so gaping that 
<a href="http://drleonardcoldwell.com/2013/08/23/leaked-german-government-warns-key-entities-not-to-use-windows-8-linked-to-nsa/">
the German government
has decided it can't be trusted</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The iPhone has a back
door <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358134/Apples-Jobs-confirms-iPhone-kill-switch.html">
that allows Apple to remotely delete apps</a> which Apple considers
&ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.  Jobs said it's ok for Apple to have this power
because of course we can trust Apple.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The iPhone has a back door
for <a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/11/22/131511381/wipeout-when-your-company-kills-your-iphone">remote
wipe</a>.  It's not always enabled, but users are led into enabling it
without understanding.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2500036/desktop-apps/microsoft--we-can-remotely-delete-windows-8-apps.html">Windows
8 also has a back door for remotely deleting apps</a>.
</p>

<p>
You might well decide to let a security service that you trust
remotely <em>deactivate</em> programs that it considers malicious.
But there is no excuse for <em>deleting</em> the programs, and you
should have the right to decide who (if anyone) to trust in this way.
</p>

<p>
As these pages show, if you do want to clean your computer of malware,
the first software to delete is Windows or iOS.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In
Android, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2506557/security0/google-throws--kill-switch--on-android-phones.html">Google
has a back door to remotely delete apps.</a>  (It is in a program
called GTalkService).
</p>

<p>
Google can
also <a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/blog/2010/06/25/remote-kill-and-install-on-google-android/">forcibly
and remotely install apps</a> through GTalkService (which seems, since
that article, to have been merged into Google Play).  This adds up to
a universal back door.
</p>

<p>
Although Google's <em>exercise</em> of this power has not been
malicious so far, the point is that nobody should have such power,
which could also be used maliciously.  You might well decide to let a
security service remotely <em>deactivate</em> programs that it
considers malicious.  But there is no excuse for allowing it
to <em>delete</em> the programs, and you should have the right to
decide who (if anyone) to trust in this way.

<p><a id="samsung"
href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor">Samsung
Galaxy devices running proprietary Android versions come with a back
door</a> that provides remote access to the files stored on the device.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Amazon Kindle has a back door that has been used
to <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/">
remotely erase books</a>.
</p>

<p>The Kindle also has
a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200774090">universal
back door</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>HP &ldquo;storage appliances&rdquo; that use the proprietary
&ldquo;Left Hand&rdquo; operating system have back doors that give
HP <a href="http://news.dice.com/2013/07/11/hp-keeps-installing-secret-backdoors-in-enterprise-storage/">remote
login access</a> to them.  HP claims that this does not give HP access
to the customer's data, but if the back door allows installation of
software changes, a change could be installed that would give access
to the customer's data.

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.itworld.com/data-protection/378427/backdoor-found-d-link-router-firmware-code">Some Dlink routers</a>
have a back door for changing settings in a dlink of an eye.

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764">Many models of router
have back doors</a>.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.techienews.co.uk/973462/bitcoin-miners-bundled-pups-legitimate-applications-backed-eula/">Some applications come with MyFreeProxy,
which is a universal back door that can download programs and run them.</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a big problem whose details are still secret.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/11/fbi-microsoft-bitlocker-backdoor/">
The FBI asks lots of companies to put back doors in proprietary programs.
</a> We don't know of specific cases where this was done, but every
proprietary program for encryption is a possibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a suspicion that we can't prove, but is worth thinking
about.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/intel_chips_could_be_nsa_key_to_ymrhS1HS1633gCWKt5tFtI">Writable
microcode for Intel and AMD microprocessors</a> may be a vehicle for
the NSA to invade computers, with the help of Microsoft, say respected
security experts.
