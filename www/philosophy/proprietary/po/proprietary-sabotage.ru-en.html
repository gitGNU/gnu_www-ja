<h2>Proprietary Sabotage</h2>

<a href="/philosophy/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary software that has something
worse than a back door.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2013/06/how-can-any-company-ever-trust-microsoft-again/index.htm">Microsoft
informs the NSA of bugs in Windows before fixing them.</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/nintendo-updates-take-wii-u-hostage-until-you-agree-new-legal-terms">Nintendo
remotely sabotaged all Wiis, making them refuse to work unless the
user agrees to a new EULA.</a>
</p>
<p>We can be quite sure this EULA is is unjust because injustice is
the only motive for imposing an EULA.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>FTDI's proprietary driver for its USB-to-serial chips has been
designed to
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/windows-update-drivers-bricking-usb-serial-chips-beloved-of-hardware-hackers/">sabotage
alternative compatible chips</a> so that they no longer work.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2014/04/windows-xp-end-of-an-era-end-of-an-error/index.htm">Microsoft
cut off security fixes for Windows XP, except to some big
users that pay exorbitantly.</a></p>

<p>I think a person or company has the right to cease to work on a
particular program; the wrong here is Microsoft does this after having
made the users dependent on Microsoft, so they are not free to ask
someone else to work on the program for them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">The
NSA has put back doors into nonfree encryption software.</a>
We don't know which ones they are, but we can be sure they include
some widely used systems.  This reinforces the point that you can never
trust the security of nonfree software.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2541250/apple-mac/update--apple-plays-hardball--upgrade--bricks--unlocked-iphones.html">An
Apple firmware &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; bricked iPhones that had been
unlocked.</a>  The &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; also deactivated applications
not approved by <a href="/philosophy/proprietary-jails.html">Apple
censorship</a>.  All this was apparently intentional.

<li>
<p>Some
proprietary <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/19/apple-talking-cats-in-app-purchases">games
lure children to spend their parents' money</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Adobe applications have time bombs:
they <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/06/adobe-goes-all-in-with-subscription-based-creative-cloud-will-stop-selling-regular-cs-licenses-shrink-wrapped-boxes/">stop
working after a certain time</a>, after which the user must pay to
extend the time.</p>

<p>Once there was a problem with the servers that these programs use
to check who has paid, and
<a href="http://www.macuser.co.uk/9015-adobe-creative-cloud-outage-leaves-adobe-users-locked-out">the applications refused to work for anyone</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sony <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/sony-steals-feature-from-your-playstation-3">sabotaged
the Playstation 3</a> with a firmware downgrade that removed the
feature that allowed users to run GNU/Linux on it.</p>

<p>Sony subsequently sent police after Geohot, after he cracked the
code that blocked users from changing the firmware, and we responded by
calling for a <a href="http://boycottsony.org">boycott of
Sony </a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>LG <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml">disabled
network features</a> on <em>previously purchased</em>
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; TVs, unless the purchasers agreed to let LG
begin to snoop on them and distribute their personal data.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Oracle's nonfree Java plug-in for
browsers <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/a-close-look-at-how-oracle-installs-deceptive-software-with-java-updates-7000010038/?s_cid=e539">sneakily
installs other annoying proprietary software</a>.</p>

<p>That article disregards all other bad things about proprietary
software.  For instance, it regards the inclusion of proprietary Flash
Player (which has
a <a href="http://www.imasuper.com/66/technology/flash-cookies-the-silent-privacy-killer/">surveillance
feature</a> and DRM) in Chrome as a good thing.  Chrome is a
proprietary browser with a universal back door.</p>

<p>We don't agree with the article's views on those issues, but we
present it as a factual reference.</p>

<p>
In
2014, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9236273/Oracle_will_continue_to_bundle_crapware_with_Java">Oracle
insisted on continuing this practice.</a></p>
