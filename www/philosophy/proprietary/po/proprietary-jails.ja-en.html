<h2>Proprietary Jails</h2>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary systems that are
<em>jails</em>&mdash;they do not allow the user to freely install
applications.  The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZRViDum.jpg">image of
the iPrison</a> illustrates this issue.</p>

<p>These systems are platforms for censorship imposed by the company
that owns the system.  Selling products designed as platforms for a
company to impose censorship ought to be forbidden by law, but it
isn't.</p>

iOS, the operating system of the Apple iThings, is a jail.</a>
Apple introduced the practice of designing general purposes computers
as jails for their users.</p>

<p>Apple used this censorship power in 2014
to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/02/07/apple-yanks-last-remaining-bit.html">
ban all bitcoin apps</a> for the iThings for a time.  It
also <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-removes-game-about-growing-marijuana-from-app-store/1100-6419864/">banned
a game about growing marijuana</a>, while permitting Games about other
crimes such as killing people.  Perhaps Apple considers killing more
acceptable than marijuana.</p>

<p>Here is an article about
the <a href="http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2008/03/07/code-signing-and-you/">code
signing</a> that the iThings use to lock up the user.</p>

Windows 8 on &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; is a jail.</a>

<p>Game consoles are jails, too: no game can run on the console unless
the console's manufacturer has authorized it.  Alas, I can't find a
article to cite as a reference for this fact.  Please inform us if you
know of one.
