<h2>Proprietary Software Is Often Malware</h2>

<p>Proprietary software, also called nonfree software,
means software that doesn't
<a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">respect users' freedom and
community</a>.  This means that
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
its developer or owner has power over its users.</a>
This power is itself an injustice.</p>

<p>The point of this page is that the initial injustice of proprietary
software often leads to further injustices: malicious
functionalities.</p>

<p>Power corrupts, so the proprietary program's developer is tempted
to design the program to mistreat its users&mdash;that is, to make
it <em>malware</em>.  (Malware means software whose functioning
mistreats the user.)  Of course, the developer usually does not do
this out of malice, but rather to put the users at a disadvantage.
That does not make it any less nasty or more legitimate.</p>

<p>Yielding to that temptation has become ever more frequent; nowadays
it is standard practice.  Modern proprietary software is software for
suckers!</p>

<p>Users of proprietary software are defenseless against these forms
of mistreatment.  The way to avoid them is by insisting on
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">free
(freedom-respecting) software.</a>  Since free software is controlled
by its users, they have a pretty good defense against malicious
software functionality.</p>
