"censorship laws</a> that ban software (and hardware) that can break the "
"handcuffs.  Instead of these laws, DRM ought to be illegal.  Please support "

"<a href=\"http://science.opposingviews.com/kindle-drm-17841.html\"> The "
"Amazon Kindle has DRM</a>.  That article is flawed in that it fails to treat "
"DRM as an ethical question; it takes for granted that whatever Amazon might "
"do to its users is legitimate.  It refers to DRM as digital "
"&ldquo;rights&rdquo; management, which is the spin term used to promote "
"DRM.  Nonetheless it serves as a reference for the facts."
