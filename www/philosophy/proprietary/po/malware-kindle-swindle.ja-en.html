<h2>Malware in the Kindle Swindle</h2>

<a href="/philosophy/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>We refer to this product as the 
<a href="/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html">Amazon Swindle</a>
because it has <a href="/philosophy/proprietary-drm.html">Digital restrictions
management (DRM)</a>  and <a href="/philosophy/ebooks.html"> 
other malicious functionalities</a>.</p>

<p>
Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  Malware means
the program is designed to mistreat or harm users when it runs.  The
difference between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</a> and nonfree software is in
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware, because
the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any
malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.

  The Amazon Kindle has DRM</a>. That article is flawed in that it
  fails to treat DRM as an ethical question; it takes for granted that
  whatever Amazon might do to its users is legitimate. It refers to DRM
  as digital &ldquo;rights&rdquo; management, which is the spin term
  used to promote DRM. Nonetheless it serves as a reference for the 
  facts.</p></li>
