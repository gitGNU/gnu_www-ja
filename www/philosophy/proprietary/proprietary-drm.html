<h2>Proprietary DRM</h2>

<a href="/philosophy/proprietary.html">Other examples of proprietary malware</a>

<p>Here are examples of proprietary programs and systems that
implement <em>digital restrictions management</em> (DRM):
functionalities designed intentionally to restrict what users can do.
These functionalities are also called <em>digital handcuffs</em>.
</p>

<p>DRM is reinforced by
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management">
censorship laws</a> that ban software (and hardware) that can break
the handcuffs.  Instead of these laws, DRM ought to be illegal.  Please
support our campaign
to <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org/">abolish DRM</a>.

<li>
<p><a href="http://science.opposingviews.com/kindle-drm-17841.html">
The Amazon Kindle has DRM</a>.  That article is flawed in that it
fails to treat DRM as an ethical question; it takes for granted that
whatever Amazon might do to its users is legitimate.  It refers to DRM
as digital &ldquo;rights&rdquo; management, which is the spin term
used to promote DRM.  Nonetheless it serves as a reference for the
facts.

<p>
We refer to that product as the
<a href="/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html"> Amazon Swindle </a>
because of this and <a href="/philosophy/ebooks.html">
other malicious functionalities</a>.

<li>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/08/aacs-tentacles/">DRM
in Windows</a>, introduced to cater to <a href="#bluray">Bluray</a>
disks.  (The article talks about how the same malware would later be
introduced in MacOS.  That had not been done at the time, but it was
done subsequently.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/11/apple-downgrades-macbook-video-drm">DRM
in MacOS</a>.  This article focuses on the fact that a new model of
Macbook introduced a requirement for monitors to have malicious
hardware, but DRM software in MacOS is involved in activating the
hardware.  The software for accessing iTunes is also responsible.

DVDs and <span id="bluray">Bluray</span> disks have DRM</a>.
</p>

<p>That page uses spin terms that favor DRM,
including <a href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#DigitalRightsManagement">
digital &ldquo;rights&rdquo; management</a>
and <a href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Protection">&ldquo;protect&rdquo;</a>,
and it claims that &ldquo;artists&rdquo; (rather than companies) are
primarily responsible for putting digital restrictions management into
these disks.  Nonetheless, it is a reference for the facts.
</p>

<p>Every Bluray disk (with few, rare exceptions) has DRM&mdash;so
don't use Bluray disks!
