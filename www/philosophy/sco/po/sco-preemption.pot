"Now that the tide has turned, and SCO is facing the dissolution of its legal "
"position, claiming to &ldquo;enforce its intellectual property rights&rdquo; "
"while actually massively infringing the rights of others, the company and "
"its lawyers have jettisoned even the appearance of legal responsibility.  "
"Last week's Wall Street Journal carried statements by Mark Heise, outside "
"counsel for SCO, challenging the &ldquo;legality&rdquo; of the Free Software "
"Foundation's GNU General Public License (GPL).  The GPL both protects "
"against the baseless claims made by SCO for license fees to be paid by users "
"of free software, and also prohibits SCO from its ongoing distribution of "
"the Linux kernel, a distribution which infringes the copyrights of thousands "
"of contributors to the kernel throughout the world.  As IBM's recently-filed "
"counterclaim for copyright infringement and violation of the GPL shows, the "
"GPL is the bulwark of the community's legal defense against SCO's "
"misbehavior.  So naturally, one would expect SCO to bring forward the best "
"possible arguments against the GPL and its application to the current "
"situation.  But there aren't any best arguments; there aren't even any good "
"arguments, and what SCO's lawyer actually said was arrant, unprofessional "
"nonsense."

"According to the Journal, Mr Heise announced that SCO would challenge the "
"GPL's &ldquo;legality&rdquo; on the ground that the GPL permits licensees to "
"make unlimited copies of programs it covers, while copyright law only allows "
"a single copy to be made.  The GPL, the Journal quoted Mr Heise as saying, "
"&ldquo;is preempted by federal copyright law.&rdquo;"

"This argument is frivolous, by which I mean that it would be a violation of "
"professional obligation for Mr Heise or any other lawyer to submit it to a "
"court.  If it were true, no copyright license could permit the licensee to "
"make multiple copies of the licensed program.  That would make not just the "
"GPL &ldquo;illegal.&rdquo; Mr Heise's supposed theory would also invalidate "
"the BSD, Apache, AFL, OSL, MIT/X11, and all other free software licenses.  "
"It would invalidate the Microsoft Shared Source license.  It would also "
"eliminate Microsoft's method for the distribution of the Windows operating "
"system, which is pre-loaded by hard drive manufacturers onto disk drives "
"they deliver by the hundreds of thousands to PC manufacturers.  The licenses "
"under which the disk drive and PC manufacturers make multiple copies of "
"Microsoft's OS would also, according to Mr Heise, violate the law.  Redmond "
"will be surprised."

"Of course, Mr Heise's statement is nothing but moonshine, based on an "
"intentional misreading of the Copyright Act that would fail on any law "
"school copyright examination.  Mr Heise is referring to section 117 of the "
"US Copyright Act, which is entitled &ldquo;Limitation on exclusive rights: "
"computer programs,&rdquo; and which provides that:"

"As the language makes absolutely clear, section 117 says that although the "
"Act generally prohibits making any copy of a copyrighted work without "
"license, in the case of computer programs one can both make and even alter "
"the work for certain purposes <em>without any license at all</em>.  The "
"claim that this provision sets a limit on what copyright owners may permit "
"through licensing their exclusive right is utterly bogus.  It has no support "
"in statutory language, legislative history, case law, or the constitutional "
"policy that lies behind the copyright system.  Were this argument actually "
"presented to a court it would certainly fail."

"The release of this astounding statement is actually good news for "
"developers and users of free software.  It shows that SCO has no defense "
"whatever against the GPL; already it has resorted to nonsense to give "
"investors the impression that it can evade the inevitable day of reckoning.  "
"Far from marking the beginning of a significant threat to the vitality of "
"the GPL, the day SCO scuttled sense altogether confirmed the strength of the "
"GPL, and its importance in protecting freedom."
