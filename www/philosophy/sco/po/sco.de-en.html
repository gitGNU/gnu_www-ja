<h2>FSF's Position regarding SCO's attacks on Free Software</h2>

<p>Much press coverage has been given in the last months to SCO's press and
legal attacks on Free Software and the GNU/Linux system.  Even though
these attacks have narrowed from a focus on the whole GNU/Linux system to
the kernel named Linux specifically, FSF, particularly through our General
Counsel Eben Moglen, remains deeply involved in strategic planning for the
community's responses to SCO.</p>

<p>Professor Moglen has been coordinating with IBM's lawyers on the
matter, including both their inside and outside counsel.  He has
coordinated with OSDL, who employ Linus Torvalds, the original author and
a key copyright holder of the kernel named Linux.  Professor Moglen
continues diplomatic efforts throughout the Free Software and Open Source
Movements, and throughout the technology industry, to bring together a
broad, coordinated coalition to oppose SCO, both legally and in the
media.</p>

<p>On this site, we will publish documents related to our work opposing SCO.</p>
