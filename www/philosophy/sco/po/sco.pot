"Much press coverage has been given in the last months to SCO's press and "
"legal attacks on Free Software and the GNU/Linux system.  Even though these "
"attacks have narrowed from a focus on the whole GNU/Linux system to the "
"kernel named Linux specifically, FSF, particularly through our General "
"Counsel Eben Moglen, remains deeply involved in strategic planning for the "
"community's responses to SCO."

"Professor Moglen has been coordinating with IBM's lawyers on the matter, "
"including both their inside and outside counsel.  He has coordinated with "
"OSDL, who employ Linus Torvalds, the original author and a key copyright "
"holder of the kernel named Linux.  Professor Moglen continues diplomatic "
"efforts throughout the Free Software and Open Source Movements, and "
"throughout the technology industry, to bring together a broad, coordinated "
"coalition to oppose SCO, both legally and in the media."
