<h2>The SCO Subpoena of FSF</h2>

<p>by <strong>Bradley M. Kuhn</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday 18 May 2004</p>

<p>
Late last year, we were subpoenaed by SCO as part of the ongoing dispute
between SCO and IBM.  Today, <a href="sco-subpoena.pdf">we made that
subpoena available on our website</a>.  This is a broad subpoena that
effectively asks for every single document about the GPL and enforcement
of the GPL since 1999.  They also demand every document and email that we
have exchanged with Linus Torvalds, IBM, and other players in the
community.  In many cases, they are asking for information that is
confidential communication between us and our lawyers, or between us and
our contributors.
</p>

<p>
As the SCO lawsuit drags on, we will have to make some tough decisions
about how to answer this subpoena.  We are certain that we will not
produce all the material requested; we will not betray our legally
protected confidences, particularly when they relate to our work upholding
the integrity of the GPL.  However, regardless of whether we dispute the
whole subpoena in court, or provide those documents which we are able to
determine are reasonable and relevant to produce, there is much work for
FSF.  If we fight the subpoena, it means substantial legal fees associated
with litigation.  If we produce materials, it means substantial effort to
gather the relevant documents.  Even though we'll be reimbursed for the
direct costs, the indirect costs in staff time will be ours to bear.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the leaked SCO documents have confirmed what we long
believed: Microsoft, having found that the smear campaign against GPL
was not succeeding, has instead bought their FUD at a bargain price
from a third party.  The &ldquo;license&rdquo; that Microsoft bought
for SCO's &ldquo;technology&rdquo; was, more than anything else, a fee
for the service of attacking the Free Software Movement and its
lowest-level program, the kernel named Linux.  Now that there has once
been a &ldquo;SCO&rdquo;, there will always be some &ldquo;SCO&rdquo;
to come and attack our movement and our work.
</p>

<p>
Even though we believe that SCO has no basis to make the claims they make,
that does not mean our community should assume it has nothing to learn
from these events.  Early in the lawsuit, we at FSF were unsure if SCO
would attack only the kernel Linux, or the entire GNU/Linux operating
system.  As copyright holder on most major components of the GNU/Linux
system, we of course feared that even while our copyright assignment
process is the best and most diligent in the whole Free Software world, we
would still be required to expend great effort in showing a judge how
exactly we did this job.  We are grateful for SCO's tactical error of
attacking one of the deepest pockets on earth, IBM, who has the checkbook
needed to efficiently fight such a nuisance lawsuit.
</p>

<p>
However, this does not mean FSF's work is done.  In addition to answering
and/or disputing the subpoena, we must also educate the community about
why it is that Linux was attacked and GNU was not.  For more than a
decade, FSF has urged projects to build a process whereby the legal
assembly of the software is as sound as the software development itself.
Many Free Software developers saw the copyright assignment process used
for most GNU components as a nuisance, but we arduously designed and
redesigned the process to remove the onerousness.  Now the SCO fiasco has
shown the community the resilience and complete certainty that a good
legal assembly process can create. (SCO, after all, eventually dropped
their claims against GNU as a whole and focused on the Linux project
which, for all its wonderful technical achievements, has a rather loose
legal assembly process.)  We have just begun a project here at FSF to
document and codify our process, so that it can be disseminated in the
form of a policy manual and accompanying software, to all other Free
Software projects who wish to solidify their legal assembly process.
Distilling nearly two decades of organizational know-how into
easy-to-understand software and documentation is no easy task, and we will
rely greatly on your financial support to aid us in carrying out this
momentous task.

<p>
As always, we at FSF look to the long-term future.  SCO is a
blip&mdash;a precursor to the challenges Free Software will face.  We
strive to be ahead of that curve and lead the way for a legally
certain future for Free Software.

We need your support to continue this work.  We ask that if you are not yet
<a href="http://member.fsf.org">an associate member of FSF, that you
join now</a>.  If you join before 15 June 2004, you will receive a
complimentary print copy of Lawrence Lessig's new book, <cite>Free
Culture</cite>.  We are happy to celebrate the addition of Professor
Lessig to our board of directors by sharing his latest written work
with you as we continue our work.
