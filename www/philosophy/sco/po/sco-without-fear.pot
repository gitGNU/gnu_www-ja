"There's a traditional definition of a shyster: a lawyer who, when the law is "
"against him, pounds on the facts; when the facts are against him, pounds on "
"the law; and when both the facts and the law are against him, pounds on the "
"table.  The SCO Group's continuing attempts to increase its market value at "
"the expense of free software developers, distributors and users through "
"outlandish legal theories and unsubstantiated factual claims show that the "
"old saying hasn't lost its relevance."

"SCO continues to claim in public statements about its lawsuit against IBM "
"that it can show infringement of its copyrights in Unix Sys V source code by "
"the free software operating system kernel called Linux.  But on the one "
"occasion when SCO has publicly shown what it claimed were examples of code "
"from Linux taken from Unix Sys V, its demonstration backfired, showing "
"instead SCO's cavalier attitude toward copyright law and its even greater "
"sloppiness at factual research."

"On August 18, 2003, SCO's CEO, Darl McBride, offered a slide presentation of "
"supposed examples of infringing literal copying from Sys V to Linux at a "
"public speech in Las Vegas.  Within hours the free software and open source "
"communities had analyzed SCO's supposed best evidence, and the results were "
"not encouraging for those investors and others who hope SCO knows what it is "
"talking about.<a href=\"#foot17\">[1]</a>"

"In Las Vegas Mr.&nbsp;McBride offered two examples of code from the Linux "
"program that were supposedly copied from Sys V.  The first implements the "
"&ldquo;Berkeley Packet Filter&rdquo; (BPF) firewall.  Indeed, the Linux "
"kernel program contains a BPF implementation, but it is the original work of "
"Linux developer Jay Schulist.  Nor did SCO ever hold an ownership interest "
"in the original BPF implementation, which as the very name shows was "
"originally part of BSD Unix, and which was copied, perfectly legally, into "
"SCO's Sys V Unix from BSD.  Because the BPF implementations in Sys V and "
"Linux have a common intellectual ancestor and perform the same function, "
"SCO's &ldquo;pattern-matching&rdquo; search of the two code bases turned up "
"an apparent example of copying.  But SCO didn't do enough research to "
"realize that the work they were claiming was infringed wasn't their own "
"(probably because they had &ldquo;carelessly&rdquo; removed the original "
"copyright notice)."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Mr.&nbsp;McBride's second example was only slightly less unconvincing.  Mr "
"McBride showed several dozen lines of memory allocation code from "
"&ldquo;Linux,&rdquo; which was identical to code from Sys V.  Once again, "
"however, it turned out that SCO had relied on &ldquo;pattern-matching&rdquo; "
"in the source code without ascertaining the actual history and copyright "
"status of the work as to which it claimed ownership and infringement.  The C "
"code shown in the slides was first incorporated in Unix Version 3, and was "
"written in 1973; it descends from an earlier version published by Donald "
"Knuth in his classic <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite> in 1968.  "
"AT&amp;T claimed this code, among other portions of its Unix OS, as "
"infringed by the University of California in the BSD litigation, and was "
"denied a preliminary injunction on the ground that it could not show a "
"likelihood of success on its copyright claim, because it had published the "
"code without copyright notices and therefore, under pre-1976 US copyright "
"law, had put the code in the public domain.  In 2002, SCO's predecessor "
"Caldera released this code again under a license that permitted free copying "
"and redistribution.  Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) then used the code in the "
"variant of the Linux program for &ldquo;Trillium&rdquo; 64-bit architecture "
"computers it was planning to sell but never shipped.  In incorporating the "
"code, SGI violated the terms of Caldera's license by erroneously removing "
"Caldera's (incorrect) copyright notice."

"Thus SCO's second example was of supposedly impermissible copying of code "
"that was in the public domain to begin with, and which SCO itself had "
"released under a free software license after erroneously claiming "
"copyright.  SGI had complicated matters by improperly removing the "
"inaccurate copyright notice.  So how many PCs and Intel-architecture servers "
"around the world contained this supposedly infringing code? Zero.  <em>No "
"version of the Linux program for Intel architectures had ever contained "
"it.</em> No SGI hardware for which this code was written ever shipped.  HP, "
"which sells 64-bit Itanium servers, has removed the code from the IA-64 "
"branch of the Linux code tree; it was technically redundant anyway.  But "
"SCO's research went no farther than discovering a supposed instance of "
"&ldquo;copying,&rdquo; without asking whether SCO had any rights in what had "
"been copied, and certainly without providing the audience to whom it was "
"speaking any indication that the &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; it was talking about "
"was a variant for rare computers from which the supposedly-offending code "
"had already been removed."

"What the Las Vegas &ldquo;examples&rdquo; actually demonstrated was that "
"SCO's factual claims were irresponsibly inflated when they weren't being "
"kept artfully &ldquo;secret.&rdquo; With the facts running against them even "
"when the facts were of their own choosing, it was unsurprising that after "
"August SCO turned to the law.  But the law was not on their side either."

"SCO's legal situation contains an inherent contradiction.  SCO claims, in "
"the letters it has sent to large corporate users of free software and in "
"public statements demanding that that users of recent versions of the kernel "
"take licenses, that the Linux program contains material over which SCO holds "
"copyright.  It also has brought trade secret claims against IBM, alleging "
"that IBM contributed material covered by non-disclosure licenses or "
"agreements to the Linux kernel.  But it has distributed and continues to "
"distribute Linux under GPL.  It has therefore published its supposed trade "
"secrets and copyrighted material, under a license that gives everyone "
"permission to copy, modify, and redistribute.  If the GPL means what it "
"says, SCO loses its trade secret lawsuit against IBM, and cannot carry out "
"its threats against users of the Linux kernel."

"But if the GPL is not a valid and effective copyright permission, by what "
"right is SCO distributing the copyrighted works of Linux's contributors, and "
"the authors of all the other copyrighted software it currently purports to "
"distribute under GPL? IBM's counterclaim against SCO raises that question "
"with respect to IBM's contributions to the Linux kernel.  Under GPL section "
"6, no redistributor of GPL'd code can add any terms to the license; SCO has "
"demanded that parties using the Linux kernel buy an additional license from "
"it, and conform to additional terms.  Under GPL section 4, anyone who "
"violates GPL automatically loses the right to distribute the work as to "
"which it is violating.  IBM therefore rightly claims that SCO has no "
"permission to distribute the kernel, and is infringing not only its "
"copyrights, but those of all kernel contributors.  Unless SCO can show that "
"the GPL is a valid form of permission, and that it has never violated that "
"permission's terms, it loses the counterclaim, and should be answerable in "
"damages not only to IBM but to all kernel contributors."

"IBM's counterclaim painted SCO into a corner on the subject of the GPL.  Not "
"only the facts but also the law are now fundamentally against SCO's "
"increasingly desperate position.  SCO and its predecessor, Caldera, have "
"benefited enormously from the protections of the GPL.  Thanks to the GPL, "
"SCO has been able, for example, to use the invaluable work of compiler "
"designers and implementers around the world who have made GCC the premier "
"cross-platform C compiler.  Customer applications run on SCO's Sys V Unix "
"because of GCC, to which SCO contributed modifications particular to its "
"system, and for which it assigned copyright to the Free Software "
"Foundation.  Caldera and SCO could not have marketed a usable operating "
"system product without the contributions of the free software community.  "
"SCO was happy to take the benefits, but it has unethically sought to avoid "
"its responsibilities.  The law does not permit SCO to have it both ways."

"So now it has become time for SCO and its lawyers to pound the table.  SCO's "
"response to IBM's counterclaim has been a round of absurd attacks on the "
"GPL, its users, and its author, the Free Software Foundation.  The GPL, "
"SCO's answer to IBM's counterclaim alleges, violates not just federal "
"statutes but also the United States Constitution.  How a private copyright "
"holder can violate the US Constitution by giving others permission to copy, "
"modify and redistribute its work SCO does not deign to say.  Legal theories "
"aren't secrets; if SCO's lawyers had anything to offer in support of this "
"novel proposition, they would offer it.  Not one case decided in the long "
"history of US copyright affords support to this ridiculous conception of an "
"unconstitutional copyright license.  No lawyer of my reasonably broad "
"acquaintance, no matter what his or her view of the GPL may be, takes this "
"moonshine seriously.  After failing on the facts, failing on the law, and "
"raising no more than derisive laughter from pounding the table, even the "
"proverbial shyster is out of luck.  What will we see next from SCO, an "
"attack on the umpire?"
