"Late last year, we were subpoenaed by SCO as part of the ongoing dispute "
"between SCO and IBM.  Today, <a href=\"sco-subpoena.pdf\">we made that "
"subpoena available on our website</a>.  This is a broad subpoena that "
"effectively asks for every single document about the GPL and enforcement of "
"the GPL since 1999.  They also demand every document and email that we have "
"exchanged with Linus Torvalds, IBM, and other players in the community.  In "
"many cases, they are asking for information that is confidential "
"communication between us and our lawyers, or between us and our "
"contributors."

"As the SCO lawsuit drags on, we will have to make some tough decisions about "
"how to answer this subpoena.  We are certain that we will not produce all "
"the material requested; we will not betray our legally protected "
"confidences, particularly when they relate to our work upholding the "
"integrity of the GPL.  However, regardless of whether we dispute the whole "
"subpoena in court, or provide those documents which we are able to determine "
"are reasonable and relevant to produce, there is much work for FSF.  If we "
"fight the subpoena, it means substantial legal fees associated with "
"litigation.  If we produce materials, it means substantial effort to gather "
"the relevant documents.  Even though we'll be reimbursed for the direct "
"costs, the indirect costs in staff time will be ours to bear."

"Meanwhile, the leaked SCO documents have confirmed what we long believed: "
"Microsoft, having found that the smear campaign against GPL was not "
"succeeding, has instead bought their FUD at a bargain price from a third "
"party.  The &ldquo;license&rdquo; that Microsoft bought for SCO's "
"&ldquo;technology&rdquo; was, more than anything else, a fee for the service "
"of attacking the Free Software Movement and its lowest-level program, the "
"kernel named Linux.  Now that there has once been a &ldquo;SCO&rdquo;, there "
"will always be some &ldquo;SCO&rdquo; to come and attack our movement and "
"our work."

"Even though we believe that SCO has no basis to make the claims they make, "
"that does not mean our community should assume it has nothing to learn from "
"these events.  Early in the lawsuit, we at FSF were unsure if SCO would "
"attack only the kernel Linux, or the entire GNU/Linux operating system.  As "
"copyright holder on most major components of the GNU/Linux system, we of "
"course feared that even while our copyright assignment process is the best "
"and most diligent in the whole Free Software world, we would still be "
"required to expend great effort in showing a judge how exactly we did this "
"job.  We are grateful for SCO's tactical error of attacking one of the "
"deepest pockets on earth, IBM, who has the checkbook needed to efficiently "
"fight such a nuisance lawsuit."

"However, this does not mean FSF's work is done.  In addition to answering "
"and/or disputing the subpoena, we must also educate the community about why "
"it is that Linux was attacked and GNU was not.  For more than a decade, FSF "
"has urged projects to build a process whereby the legal assembly of the "
"software is as sound as the software development itself.  Many Free Software "
"developers saw the copyright assignment process used for most GNU components "
"as a nuisance, but we arduously designed and redesigned the process to "
"remove the onerousness.  Now the SCO fiasco has shown the community the "
"resilience and complete certainty that a good legal assembly process can "
"create. (SCO, after all, eventually dropped their claims against GNU as a "
"whole and focused on the Linux project which, for all its wonderful "
"technical achievements, has a rather loose legal assembly process.)  We have "
"just begun a project here at FSF to document and codify our process, so that "
"it can be disseminated in the form of a policy manual and accompanying "
"software, to all other Free Software projects who wish to solidify their "
"legal assembly process.  Distilling nearly two decades of organizational "
"know-how into easy-to-understand software and documentation is no easy task, "
"and we will rely greatly on your financial support to aid us in carrying out "
"this momentous task."

"As always, we at FSF look to the long-term future.  SCO is a blip&mdash;a "
"precursor to the challenges Free Software will face.  We strive to be ahead "
"of that curve and lead the way for a legally certain future for Free "
"Software."
