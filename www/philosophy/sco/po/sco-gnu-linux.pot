"SCO's contract dispute with IBM has been accompanied by a smear campaign "
"against the whole GNU/Linux system.  But SCO made an obvious mistake when it "
"erroneously quoted me as saying that &ldquo;Linux is a copy of Unix.&rdquo; "
"Many readers immediately smelled a rat&mdash;not only because I did not say "
"that, and not only because the person who said it was talking about "
"published ideas (which are uncopyrightable)  rather than code, but because "
"they know I would never compare Linux with Unix."

"Unix is a complete operating system, but Linux is just part of one.  SCO is "
"using the popular confusion between Linux and the GNU/Linux system to "
"magnify the fear that it can spread.  GNU/Linux is the GNU operating system "
"running with Linux as the kernel.  The kernel is the part of the system that "
"allocates the machine's resources to the other programs you run.  That part "
"is Linux."

"We developed GNU starting in 1984 as a campaign for freedom, whose aim was "
"to eliminate non-free software from our lives.  GNU is free software, "
"meaning that users are free to run it, study it and change it (or pay "
"programmers to do this for them), redistribute it (gratis or for a fee), and "
"publish modified versions.  (See <a href=\"/gnu/thegnuproject.html\">an "
"overview of the GNU project</a>.)"

"In 1991, GNU was mostly finished, lacking only a kernel.  In 1992, Linus "
"Torvalds made his kernel, Linux, free software.  Others combined GNU and "
"Linux to produce the first complete free operating system, GNU/Linux.  (See "
"<a href=\"/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html\">our GNU/Linux FAQ</a>.)  GNU/Linux is "
"also free software, and SCO made use of this freedom by selling their "
"version of it.  Today, GNU runs with various kernels including Linux, the "
"GNU Hurd (our kernel), and the NetBSD kernel.  It is basically the same "
"system whichever kernel you use."

"Those who combined Linux with GNU didn't recognize that's what they were "
"doing, and they spoke of the combination as &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.  The "
"confusion spread; many users and journalists call the whole system "
"&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.  Since they also properly call the kernel "
"&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, the result is even more confusion: when a statement "
"says &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, you can only guess what software it refers to.  "
"SCO's irresponsible statements are shot through with ambiguous references to "
"&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.  It is impossible to attribute any coherent meaning to "
"them overall, but they appear to accuse the entire GNU/Linux system of being "
"copied from Unix."

"The name GNU stands for &ldquo;GNU's Not Unix&rdquo;.  The whole point of "
"developing the GNU system is that it is not Unix.  Unix is and always was "
"non-free software, meaning that it denies its users the freedom to cooperate "
"and to control their computers.  To use computers in freedom as a community, "
"we needed a free software operating system.  We did not have the money to "
"buy and liberate an existing system, but we did have the skill to write a "
"new one.  Writing GNU was a monumental job.  We did it for our freedom, and "
"your freedom."

"To copy Unix source code would not be ethically wrong <a "
"href=\"#footnote\">[1]</a>, but it is illegal; our work would fail to give "
"users lawful freedom to cooperate if it were not done lawfully.  To make "
"sure we would not copy Unix source code or write anything similar, we told "
"GNU contributors not even to look at Unix source code while developing code "
"for GNU.  We also suggested design approaches that differ from typical Unix "
"design approaches, to ensure our code would not resemble Unix code.  We did "
"our best to avoid ever copying Unix code, despite our basic premise that to "
"prohibit copying of software is morally wrong."

"Another SCO tool of obfuscation is the term &ldquo;intellectual "
"property&rdquo;.  This fashionable but foolish term carries an evident bias: "
"that the right way to treat works, ideas, and names is as a kind of "
"property.  Less evident is the harm it does by inciting simplistic thinking: "
"it lumps together diverse laws&mdash;copyright law, patent law, trademark "
"law and others&mdash;which really have little in common.  This leads people "
"to suppose those laws are one single issue, the &ldquo;intellectual property "
"issue&rdquo;, and think about &ldquo;it&rdquo;&mdash;which means, to think "
"at such a broad abstract level that the specific social issues raised by "
"these various laws are not even visible.  Any opinion &ldquo;about "
"intellectual property&rdquo; is thus bound to be foolish.  (See <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html\">our list of words to avoid</a> for "
"more explanation of the confusion caused by this term.)"

"In the hands of a propagandist for increased copyright or patent powers, the "
"term is a way to prevent clear thinking.  In the hands of someone making "

"In an actual lawsuit, such ambiguity would make their case fail, or even "
"prevent it from getting off the ground.  If, however, SCO's aim is to shake "
"the tree and see if any money falls down, or simply to spread fear, they may "
"regard vagueness and mystery as advantageous."

"I cannot prognosticate about the SCO vs IBM lawsuit itself: I don't know "
"what was in their contract, I don't know what IBM did, and I am not a "
"lawyer.  The Free Software Foundation's lawyer, Professor Moglen, believes "
"that SCO gave permission for the community's use of the code that they "
"distributed under the GNU GPL and other free software licenses in their "
"version of GNU/Linux."

"However, I can address the broader issue of such situations.  In a community "
"of over half a million developers, we can hardly expect that there will "
"never be plagiarism.  But it is no disaster; we discard that material and "
"move on.  If there is material in Linux that was contributed without legal "
"authorization, the Linux developers will learn what it is and replace it.  "
"SCO cannot use its copyrights, or its contracts with specific parties, to "
"suppress the lawful contributions of thousands of others.  Linux itself is "
"no longer essential: the GNU system became popular in conjunction with "
"Linux, but today it also runs with two BSD kernels and the GNU kernel.  Our "
"community cannot be defeated by this."

"Since this statement directly contradicts the establishment views of the "
"proprietary software developers, some readers suppose that the word "
"&ldquo;not&rdquo; was inserted by mistake.  It is entirely intentional.  It "
"is not wrong to copy software.  It is wrong to stop others from copying "
"software.  Thus, software should be free."
