<h2>Malware in Mobile Devices</h2>

<p>
<em>Malware</em> means software designed to function in ways that
mistreat or harm the user.  (This does not include accidental errors.)
</p>

<p>
Malware and nonfree software are two different issues.  The difference
between <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> and
nonfree software is in
<a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
whether the users have control of the program or vice versa</a>.  It's
not directly a question of what the program <em>does</em> when it
runs.  However, in practice nonfree software is often malware, because
the developer's awareness that the users would be powerless to fix any
malicious functionalities tempts the developer to impose some.
</p>

<p>Here are examples of malware in mobile devices.  See also
the <a href="/philosophy/malware-apple.html">the Apple malware
page</a> for malicious functionalities specific to the Apple
iThings.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Portable phones with GPS will send their GPS location on remote
  command and users cannot stop them: <a

  http://www.aclu.org/government-location-tracking-cell-phones-gps-devices-and-license-plate-readers</a>. 
  (The US says it will eventually require all new portable phones to have 
  GPS.)</p></li>

  <li><p>Most mobile phones have a universal back door, which has been used to
  <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/22/nsa_can_reportedly_track_cellphones_even_when_they_re_turned_off.html">
  turn them malicious</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor">
  Samsung Galaxy devices running proprietary Android versions come with a back 
  door</a> that provides remote access to the data stored on the device.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/privacy-scandal-nsa-can-spy-on-smart-phone-data-a-920971.html">
  The NSA can tap data in smart phones, including iPhones, Android, and
  BlackBerry</a>. While there is not much detail here, it seems that this 
  does not operate via the universal back door that we know nearly all 
  portable phones have. It may involve exploiting various bugs. There are 
  <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone">
  lots of bugs in the phones' radio software</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Spyware in Cisco TNP IP phones: <a

  http://boingboing.net/2012/12/29/your-cisco-phone-is-listening.html</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Spyware in Android phones (and Windows? laptops): The Wall Street
  Journal (in an article blocked from us by a paywall) reports that
  <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/1/4580718/fbi-can-remotely-activate-android-and-laptop-microphones-reports-wsj">
  the FBI can remotely activate the GPS and microphone in Android phones and
  laptops</a>. (I suspect this means Windows laptops.) Here is <a 
  href="http://cryptome.org/2013/08/fbi-hackers.htm">more info</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://blog.azimuthsecurity.com/2013/04/unlocking-motorola-bootloader.html">
  Some Android phones are tyrants</a> (though someone found a way to crack 
  the restriction). Fortunately, most Android devices are not tyrants.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/">
  Mobile devices that come with Windows 8 are tyrants</a>. <a 
  href="http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/301057/microsoft-metro-app-store-lockdown">
  Windows 8 on &ldquo;mobile devices&rdquo; is a jail.</a></p></li>
