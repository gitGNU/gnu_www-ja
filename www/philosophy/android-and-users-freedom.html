Free Your Android</a> campaign.</h3>

<p>To what extent does Android respect the freedom of its users? For a
computer user that values freedom, that is the most important question
to ask about any software system.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://fsf.org">free/libre software movement</a>, we 
develop software that respects users' freedom, so we and you can escape 
from software that doesn't. By contrast, the idea of &ldquo;open
source&rdquo; focuses on how to develop code; it is a different current 
of thought whose principal value is <a
href="/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">code
quality rather than freedom</a>. Thus, the concern here is not whether 
Android is &ldquo;open&rdquo;, but whether it allows users to be free.</p>

<p>Android is an operating system primarily for mobile phones, which
consists of Linux (Torvalds' kernel), some libraries, a Java platform
and some applications. Linux aside, the software of Android versions
1 and 2 was mostly developed by Google; Google released it under the
Apache 2.0 license, which is a lax free software license without
<a href="/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a>.</p>

<p>The version of Linux included in Android is not entirely free
software, since it contains nonfree &ldquo;binary blobs&rdquo; (just 
like Torvalds' version of Linux), some of which are really used in some
Android devices. Android platforms use other nonfree firmware, too,
and nonfree libraries. Aside from those, the source code of Android
versions 1 and 2, as released by Google, is free software&mdash;but this
code is insufficient to run the device. Some of the applications that
generally come with Android are nonfree, too.</p>

<p>Android is very different from the <a
href="/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">GNU/Linux operating
system</a> because it contains very little of GNU. Indeed, just about 
the only component in common between Android and GNU/Linux is Linux, the 
kernel. People who erroneously think &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; refers to the 
entire GNU/Linux combination get tied in knots by these facts, and make 
paradoxical statements such as &ldquo;Android contains Linux, but it 
isn't Linux.&rdquo; If we avoid starting from the confusion, the 
situation is simple: Android contains Linux, but not GNU; thus, Android 
and GNU/Linux are mostly different.</p>

<p>Within Android, Linux the kernel remains a separate program, with its
source code under <a href="/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU GPL
version 2</a>. To combine Linux with code under the Apache 2.0 license 
would be copyright infringement, since GPL version 2 and Apache 2.0 are 
<a href="/licenses/license-list.html#apache2">incompatible</a>.
Rumors that Google has somehow converted Linux to the Apache license are
erroneous; Google has no power to change the license on the code of 
Linux, and did not try. If the authors of Linux allowed its use under <a
href="/licenses/gpl.html">GPL version 3</a>,
then that code could be combined with Apache-licensed code, with the
combination could be released under GPL version 3. But Linux has not
been released that way.</p>

<p>Google has complied with the requirements of the GNU General Public
License for Linux, but the Apache license on the rest of Android does
not require source release. Google said it would never publish the
source code of Android 3.0 (aside from Linux). Android 3.1 source code
was also withheld, making Android 3, apart from Linux, nonfree
software pure and simple.</p>

<p>Google said it withheld the 3.0 source code because it was buggy, and
that people should wait for the next release. That may be good advice
for people who simply want to run the Android system, but the users
should be the ones to decide this. Anyway, developers and tinkerers
who want to include some of the changes in their own versions could
use that code just fine.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Google later released the source code for Android 3.*
when it released version 4 (also with source code).  The problem above
turned out to be a temporary aberration rather than a policy shift.
However, what happens once may happen again.</p>

<p>In any case, most of the source code of various versions of Android
has been released as free software. Does that mean that products using
those Android versions respect users' freedom? No, for several
reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, most of them contain nonfree Google applications for
talking to services such as YouTube and Google Maps. These are
officially not part of Android, but that doesn't make the product ok.
</p>

<p>Most Android devices come with the nonfree Google Play software
(formerly &ldquo;Android Market&rdquo;).  This software invites users
with a Google account to install nonfree apps.  It also has a back
door with which Google can forcibly install or deinstall apps.  This
is officially not part of Android, but that doesn't make it any less
bad.
</p>

<p>Android products also come with nonfree libraries.  These are
officially not part of Android, but that since various Android
functionalities depend on them, they are part of any real Android
installation.</p>

<p>Even the programs that are officially part of Android may not
correspond to the source code Google releases. Manufacturers may
change this code, and often they don't release the source code for
their versions. The GNU GPL requires them to distribute the code for
their versions of Linux, assuming they comply. The rest of the code,
under the lax Apache license, does not require them to release the
source version that they really use.</p>

<p>One change that some manufacturers make in Android is the addition
of <a 
href="http://androidsecuritytest.com/features/logs-and-services/loggers/carrieriq/">
a hidden general surveillance package</a> such as Carrier IQ.</p>

<p><a href="http://replicant.us">Replicant</a>, a free version of
Android that supports just a few phone models, has replaced many
of these libraries, and you can do without the nonfree apps. But
there are other problems.</p>

<p>Some device models are &ldquo;tyrants&rdquo;: they are designed so users
cannot install and run their own modified software, only the versions
approved by some company. In that situation, the executables are not
free even if they were made from sources that are free and available
to you. However, some Android devices can be &ldquo;rooted&rdquo; so
users can install different software.</p>

<p>Important firmware or drivers are generally proprietary also. These
handle the phone network radio, WiFi, bluetooth, GPS, 3D graphics, the
camera, the speaker, and in some cases the microphone too. On some
models, a few of these drivers are free, and there are some that you
can do without&mdash;but you can't do without the microphone or the 
phone network radio.</p>

<p>The phone network firmware comes preinstalled. If all it did was
sit there and talk to the phone network when you wish, we could regard
it as equivalent to a circuit. When we insist that the software in a
computing device must be free, we can overlook preinstalled firmware
that will never be upgraded, because it makes no difference to the
user that it's a program rather than a circuit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in this case it would be a malicious circuit.
Malicious features are unacceptable no matter how they are
implemented.</p>

<p>On most Android phones, this firmware has so much control that it
could turn the product into a listening device. On some, it controls
the microphone. On some, it can take full control of the main
computer, through shared memory, and can thus override or replace
whatever free software you have installed. With some models it is
possible to exercise remote control of this firmware, and thus of the
phone's computer, through the phone radio network. The point of free
software is that we have control of our computing, and this doesn't
qualify. While any computing system might <em>have</em> bugs, these
devices can <em>be</em> bugs. (Craig Murray,
in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/aug/12/politics">Murder
in Samarkand</a>, relates his involvement in an intelligence operation
that remotely converted an unsuspecting target's non-Android portable
phone into a listening device.)</p>

<p>In any case, the phone network firmware in an Android device is not
equivalent to a circuit, because the hardware allows installation of
new versions and this is actually done. Since it is proprietary
firmware, in practice only the manufacturer can make new
versions&mdash;users can't.</p>

<p>Putting these points together, we can tolerate nonfree phone network
firmware provided new versions of it won't be loaded, it can't take
control of the main computer, and it can only communicate when and as
the free operating system chooses to let it communicate. In other
words, it has to be equivalent to circuitry, and that circuitry must
not be malicious. There is no obstacle to building an Android phone
which has these characteristics, but we don't know of any.</p>

<p>Android is not a self-hosting system; development for Android needs
to be done on some other system.  The tools in Google's
&ldquo;software development kit&rdquo; (SDK) are appear to be free,
but it is hard work to check this.  The definition files for certain
Google APIs are nonfree.  Installing the SDK requires signing a
proprietary software license, which you should refuse to sign.
<a href="http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/ReplicantSDK">
Replicant's SDK </a> is a free replacement.</p>

<p>Recent press coverage of Android focuses on the patent wars. During
20 years of campaigning for the abolition of software patents, we have
warned such wars could happen. Software patents could force
elimination of features from Android, or even make it unavailable.
See <a href="http://endsoftpatents.org">endsoftpatents.org</a> for more
information about why software patents must be abolished.</p>

<p>However, the patent attacks and Google's responses are not directly
relevant to the topic of this article: how Android products partly
approach an ethically system of distribution, and how they fall
short. This issue merits the attention of the press too.</p>

<p>Android is a major step towards an ethical, user-controlled, free
software portable phone, but there is a long way to go. Hackers are
working on <a href="http://replicant.us">Replicant</a>, but it's a big
job to support a new phone model, and there remains the problem of the
firmware. Even though the Android phones of today are considerably less
bad than Apple or Windows smartphones, they cannot be said to respect
your freedom.</p>
