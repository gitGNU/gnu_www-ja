  GNU Enterprise and Double Choco Latte Projects Merge to Further Accelerate
  Free Software Enterprise Application Offerings

                                
   Boston, MA, USA - Tuesday, March, 05, 2002 - Double Choco Latte (DCL),
   a work order and help desk management system, today announced that it
   will be merging into GNU Enterprise (GNUe), a GNU Package. These two
   projects give individual and corporate users software freedom for
   enterprise applications through the GNU General Public License, which
   grants and defends users' freedoms to copy, share, modify, and
   redistribute software.
   
   "DCL has always had a vision of creating an integrated set of
   applications," said Michael Dean, Lead Developer of Double Choco
   Latte, "The merging of these two projects will accelerate the process
   of making that vision a reality. Additionally, the GNUe tools will
   provide a very robust and customizable framework on which to build,
   integrate, and extend DCL in ways that would have required
   significantly more development effort. GNUe and DCL together will help
   create solutions that meet the requirements of an organization's ERP
   or CRM needs."
   
   By putting DCL under the GNUe umbrella, additional resources will be
   immediately devoted to it. DCL and its existing PHP interfaces will
   quickly be available under the GNUe Application Framework. DCL will be
   better modularized. Stronger customer management and billing/invoicing
   by project/work order will be the first of many new features. DCL will
   become the project management package of GNUe and will use GNUe
   modules for many of its components.
   
   "From my first experience with DCL I had a feeling that there was a
   lot to be gained by combining our projects," said Derek Neighbors,
   co-maintainer of GNU Enterprise,"and after many late nights with the
   DCL team, we all realized it just makes sense to work together. The
   DCL team was filling a lot of gaps in the GNUe vision that we just
   hadn't had the time to focus on, and we were able to offer a lot of
   immediate input into DCL to help make it more rounded."
   
   The combining of talent from both of these free software projects
   should only help accelerate the development of much needed free
   software enterprise applications. By increasing the breadth of
   enterprise applications that are under a free software license, users
   are given options to proprietary software that adversely restrict them
   and their businesses. Adding the additional talent and visions to both
   projects only helps expand the offerrings of integrated, yet modular,
   solutions for small to mid size enterprises.

  About GNU/Linux:
  
   GNU/Linux is the integrated combination of the GNU operating system
   with the kernel, Linux, written by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The various
   versions of GNU/Linux have an estimated 20 million users.
   
   Some people call the GNU/Linux system "Linux", but this misnomer leads
   to confusion (people cannot tell whether you mean the whole system or
   the kernel, one part), and spreads an inaccurate picture of how, when
   and where the system was developed. Making a consistent distinction
   between GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel,
   is the best way to clear up the confusion. See
   http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html for more explanation.
