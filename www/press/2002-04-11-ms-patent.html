    Microsoft, in its new "Royalty-Free CIFS Technical Reference License
    Agreement", unequivocally targets Free Software developers who choose
    copyleft licensing terms.  Microsoft's new license directly attacks
    the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the GNU Lesser General Public
    License (LGPL)----licenses published by the Free Software Foundation
    (FSF) and used prominently by numerous Free Software projects
    worldwide.
   <p>
   
    Microsoft has veiled this attack in the trappings of a "gift".
    Microsoft agrees to grant royalty-free permission to use and exercise
    their CIFS patents in Free Software, but only to a limited set of
    developers.  Under the guise of fulfilling its obligations under the
    anti-trust settlement, Microsoft has singled out developers and
    companies who choose copyleft licenses (such as GPL and LGPL).
    Software distributors of copylefted software are forbidden from
    exercising the patents royalty-free, and thus are effectively
    forbidden from exercising the patents at all under copyleft.  In
    effect, Microsoft has vindicated the <A HREF="/philosophy/ms-doj-tunney.html">warnings FSF set forth in its
    Tunney act filing against the Proposed Revised Final Judgment in
    United States vs. Microsoft</A>.  As we there warned the Justice
    Department and the courts, the settlement terms are not in the public
    interest because they permit Microsoft to deny effective access to
    their APIs to Microsoft's most effective competitors--Free Software
    developers.
   <p>
   
    Microsoft's tactics were no surprise to Bradley M. Kuhn, executive
    director of the FSF, who pointed out: "Microsoft's new assault follows
    a year's worth of rhetoric aimed at slandering the GPL and those who,
    in the name of software freedom, advocate the use of GPL.  Now, that
    war of words has been followed up with a legal attack.  As Mundie's
    speeches tried and failed to do last summer, Microsoft seeks to
    pressure existing GPL'ed projects to give up copyleft.  Microsoft
    loves non-copylefted Free Software; it allows them to benefit from the
    commons without contributing back.  In copylefted Free Software,
    Microsoft now faces a rival that they cannot buy nor run out of
    business.  As expected, they've turned to their patent pool as their
    last resort to assail us".  Fortunately, developers of GPL'ed code
    stand united in rejecting this anti-competitive act by Microsoft.  The
    FSF is also encouraging key industry leaders who distribute and rely
    on GPL'ed software to stand against Microsoft on this matter.
   <p>
   
    This situation exemplifies the dire threat software patents have
    against software freedom.  Fortunately, software patents do not exist
    in every country.  The FSF urges citizens in software-patent-free
    countries to demand that their governments categorically reject
    software patents.  Kuhn noted: "the best way to fight Microsoft as
    they offensively assert their patent rights is to convince your
    government not to recognize software patents as a legitimate use of
    patent law".  The fight against software patents is particularly
    urgent in Europe, as the European Union may decide to permit software
    patents soon.  Europeans citizens are encouraged to support efforts
    opposing software patents for the EU.  For more information, see
