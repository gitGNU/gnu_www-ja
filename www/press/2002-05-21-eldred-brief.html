Aschroft Supreme Court Case</h1><h2></h2><strong>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</strong> - <i>Tuesday, May 21, 2002</i> - 
   
    Yesterday, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) filed a Brief Amicus
    Curiae in the pending Supreme Court case, Eldred v. Aschroft.  The
    future of copyright law in the digital age is at issue in this case.
    For decades, the US Congress has been retroactively extending
    copyright protection, directly harming the public good by withholding
    material from the public domain.  FSF strongly supports the rights of
    the public to benefit from useful intellectual works.<p>
   
    In our brief, Eben Moglen, FSF Board Member and General Counsel,
     wrote: "The constitutional importance of the 'limited Times'
     restriction cannot be vitiated ... by affording Congress the
     opportunity to create perpetuities on the installment plan, any more
     than Congress can eliminate the constitutional requirement of
     originality".  He continues: "To turn the system of free expression
     into a series of private fiefdoms for the benefit of monopolists ...
     is forbidden to Congress by the plain wording of the Copyright Clause
     and by the First Amendment".
   <p>
   
    While nearly all of the Free Software code base at the core of the
    popular GNU/Linux operating system is copyrighted--much of it
    protected by FSF's GNU General Public License (GPL)--FSF promotes a
    healthy and vibrant public domain.  Copyright is a government-granted,
    limited time, monopolistic control that has run amok.  FSF filed this
    amicus brief to stand with those who fight for the public's freedom to
    build on the intellectual works of the past.
