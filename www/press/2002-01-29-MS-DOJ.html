    Eben Moglen, board member and general legal counsel to the Free
    Software Foundation, yesterday filed a response to the Proposed
    Revised Final Judgment in United States vs. Microsoft.  The FSF seeks
    to remove verbiage added by Microsoft that we believe would eliminate
    the value of the settlement by preventing Free Software systems from
    competing effectively against Windows products.
   <p>
   
    Moglen reiterated today: "The language of the Proposed Judgment should
     be amended to require Microsoft to release timely and accurate API
     information to all parties seeking to interoperate programs with
     Microsoft Windows and applications written to work with Microsoft
     Windows."
   <p>
   
    The Proposed Judgment allows Microsoft to specifically block such
    interoperation through two specific methods.  First, under the
    Proposed Judgment, Microsoft can keep API information out of the hands
    of Free Software developers through the imposition of royalty
    requirements.  Large groups of cooperating volunteers are both
    logistically and financially unable to pay such royalties for access
    to APIs.  Royalty charges for Microsoft API access would slow to a
    halt Windows interoperability work by their most viable competitor,
    the Free Software GNU/Linux operating system.  Free Software
    developers have by the nature of their development model always
    given unfettered access to their APIs, and we ask that Microsoft be
    required to do the same.
   <p>
   
    Second, the Proposed Judgment includes broad language concerning the
    disclosure of communications protocols.  This provision is so
    indefinite that Microsoft will likely argue that all APIs and
    communications protocols connected with the security and
    authentication aspects of electronic commerce can be kept secret.
    Industry standard security practices currently demand that all such
    protocols be publicly known and documented.  Under this Judgment,
    Microsoft would be permitted to keep these private from both Free
    Software and the public relying on them for their privacy and
    security.

<hr><h3>About GNU/Linux: </h3><p>

  GNU/Linux is the integrated combination of the GNU operating system with
  the kernel, Linux, written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  The various
  versions of GNU/Linux have an estimated 20 million users.
<p>

  Some people call the GNU/Linux system "Linux", but this misnomer leads to
  confusion (people cannot tell whether you mean the whole system or the
  kernel, one part), and spreads an inaccurate picture of how, when and
  where the system was developed.  Making a consistent distinction between
  GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel, is the best
  way to clear up the confusion.  See
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html</a> for more
  explanation.
