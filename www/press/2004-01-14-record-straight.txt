        Setting the Record Straight: The Free Software Foundation,
              the General Public License and SCO versus IBM

Boston, MA, USA - Wednesday, January 14, 2004 - On Wednesday, January 21,
2004, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) will hold a press conference
at Columbia University to discuss the strengths and successes of the
GNU General Public License (GPL) and to refute the claims made by the
The SCO Group, Ltd. (SCO) and their counsel in their ongoing lawsuit
against International Business Machines Corp (IBM).

In the last few months, SCO has been sowing confusion and misinformation
regarding the validity of the GNU GPL as part of their strategy to extort
money from users of the kernel named Linux, which is licensed under
FSF's GPL.  FSF, the umpire of Free Software disputes, will respond to
SCO's lawsuit and will explain how SCO seeks to inappropriately increase
its own market value at the expense of the legitimate activity of the
Free Software community's developers, distributors and users.

This press conference is valuable to anyone interested in the state of
Free Software, its licensing issues, the SCO v. IBM lawsuit, and the
integrity of the GNU GPL.  FSF maintains that the SCO lawsuit is not only
without merit, but that SCO have themselves benefited from distribution
the kernel named Linux under GPL, even as they question that license's
validity.  Indeed, Professor Eben Moglen, FSF Board Member and General
Counsel, has pointed out that SCO has distributed Linux under GPL, even
after filing their lawsuit.  SCO has therefore published its supposed
trade secrets and copyrighted material under a license that gives
everyone permission to copy, modify, and redistribute that software.

Professor Moglen will head the press conference and will discuss both
the strengths and successes of the GPL -- the most popular and widely
used Free Software copyright license.  As the lawyer behind most
successful enforcement efforts of GPL, and a nationally recognized
authority on alternatives to contemporary copyright and patent law,
Professor Moglen is in an unique position to discuss the history of the
GPL, the FSF's continued success in obtaining compliance with the GPL,
and why SCO's attack on the users of the kernel named Linux and the
GPL is both unprecedented and without merit.

This press conference offers an excellent opportunity to understand the
history and intent of the GPL, its importance in the IT community and the
weakness of SCO's current lawsuit against IBM.  Professor Moglen will be
available to answer questions both during and after the press conference.
