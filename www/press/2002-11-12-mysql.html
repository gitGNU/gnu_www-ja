    The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced that MySQL AB, the
     company that develops, supports and markets the MySQL database, made
     a contribution of $25,000 to the FSF to support the protection and
     promotion of the GNU General Public License (GPL).  The FSF incurs
     over $100,000 in costs each year defending and enforcing the GPL.
     MySQL is the first company to contribute generously to support this
     work.<p>

   
    Marten Mickos, CEO of MySQL, explained the motivation for this
     donation: "MySQL appreciates FSF's tireless work preserving,
     protecting and promoting Free Software, diligently policing the use
     of the GPL, defending GPL developers against license breaches, and
     educating the world about the principles of software freedom".
     Continued Mickos, "Everyone who uses Open Source and Free Software
     owes the FSF more than a debt of gratitude.  We hope that our
     contribution will encourage other individuals and vendors who believe
     in and rely on the GPL to support the FSF any way they can."
   <p>
  
   
    MySQL's gift supports FSF's GPL Compliance Lab, an initiative that has
     existed informally since 1992, but was formalized by FSF late last
     year. The goal of the Compliance Lab is to help enforce the GPL
     license so that GPL-violating competitors cannot take advantage of
     companies that do comply with the license.
   <p>

   
    According to Bradley M. Kuhn, FSF's Executive Director: "FSF sees the
     defense of the license as fundamental to the work of the Free
     Software Movement.  Even though FSF is strapped for resources, when
     MySQL needed help in their enforcement of the GPL, FSF lent its
     expertise.  We are committed to doing this work regardless of our
     funding woes.  We have always seen the need for an impartial party to
     enforce GPL.  We are elated that MySQL shares our view and is willing
     to support our work financially."
   <p>

   
    Ideally, to run at full capacity, FSF's GPL Compliance Lab would
     require a budget of $200,000 per year.  When the Compliance Lab was
     formalized, FSF had hoped that many companies that benefit greatly
     from Free Software would recognize its importance and help pay for
     the costs of this service.  FSF hopes that this show of support will
     encourage other companies to come forward.
   <p>

   
    In 1992, when FSF was working informally to enforce GPL, there were
    just one or two violations each year.  Today, FSF handles and resolves
    -- through diplomatic negotiation -- at least fifty GPL violations
    each year.  All indications are that these numbers will continue to
    grow indefinitely.
   <p>

<hr><h3>About the GNU GPL: </h3><p>

     
      FSF created the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989 and
       periodically publishes updated versions of that license.  Today,
       GPL is the most common Free Software license, used for over 50
       percent of all known Free Software.  Unlike most copyright
       agreements that are designed to take away users' freedoms, the GPL
       guarantees users' rights to share and change Free Software.  Many
       companies, including MySQL AB, IBM and HP have profitable business
       units centered around these freedoms.
    <p>

     
      The GPL is seen as a serious threat by many proprietary software
       companies whose licenses aim to take these freedoms from users.
       All the while, FSF continues to defend the GNU GPL against both PR
       and legal attacks and diligently works on version 3 (GPLv3) of the
       license (the first new version in 12 years).  GPLv3 will address
       new issues of freedom for users and programmers that were unknown
       at the time of the 1991 version 2 publication.  No date for public
       draft distribution of GPLv3 has been set, but it is expected in the
       first half of 2003.  An early draft of a few GPLv3 provisions was
       released earlier this year as part of the Affero General Public
       License.
