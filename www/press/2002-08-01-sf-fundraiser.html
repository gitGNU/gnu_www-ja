    For the benefit of FSF, Affero is hosting a party and fund-raising
    evening on Wednesday, August 14, 2002 from 6 PM to 10 PM at Club NV at
    525 Howard Street in San Francisco, CA.  We invite all, including
    attendees of the nearby LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, to participate
    in this "Full Tilt for Software Freedom", where attendees will enjoy
    an evening of vintage pinball gaming.  Free (as in price) snacks will
    be provided and a cash bar will be available.
   <p>
   
    A $10 donation to FSF is suggested for this event.  In addition, some
    pinball tables will be sponsored by companies, including HP and IBM.
    Each table sponsor will donate $5,000 in the name of the
    highest-scoring player on the table that evening.
   <p>
   
    The event will be highlighted by the music of Shady Lady.  In
    addition, Bradley M. Kuhn, Executive Director of FSF, and Lawrence
    Lessig, noted author and law professor at Stanford University will
    each make brief remarks about the issues of software freedom.  They
    both will be available at the event for questions and discussion with
    attendees.
   <p>
   
    Those who would like to engage in an extensive discussion with Kuhn
    and Lessig are invited to support the FSF further by attending a
    fund-raising dinner prior to the "Full Tilt" event.  The fund-raising
    dinner will be held at a nearby restaurant, and the cost of $250 per
    person which includes dinner and wine.  Seating is limited; you can
    reserve a space by contacting Ravi Khanna at ravi@fsf.org or at
