"<strong>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</strong> - <em>Monday, March 18th, "
"2002</em> - The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today heralded the launch of "
"the Digital Speech Project: an effort to encourage and coordinate activism "
"to protect our digital freedoms in light of the Digital Millennium Copyright "
"Act (DMCA) and similar laws.  The FSF has hired a Digital Freedom Organizer, "
"Jonathan Watterson, to work actively on the the Digital Speech Project."

"Bradley M. Kuhn, vice president of the FSF, explained FSF's interest in this "
"project: &ldquo;The FSF focuses on the fight for software freedom, but we "
"realize that without related freedoms, software freedom can easily be "
"eroded.  The Digital Speech Project fights for the freedom of all users of "
"all technology from legislative technology control measures like the DMCA "
"and the proposed proposed Security Systems Standards and Certification Act "
"(SSSCA).  These laws do menace software freedom, but we hope to educate the "
"public that these laws threaten many different and important "
"freedoms.&rdquo;"

"Watterson added: &ldquo;The DMCA hurts everybody&mdash;software developers, "
"technology companies, computer users, authors, artists, musicians, "
"filmakkers, and anyone who benefits and enjoys a free marketplace of "
"creative expression.  I am excited that the FSF has taken on this issue, and "
"that FSF recognizes that Free Software supporters share common ground on "
"this issue with many other groups&rdquo;."
