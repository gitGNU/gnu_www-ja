"The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSF Europe) is a charitable "
"non-governmental organization dedicated to all aspects of Free Software in "
"Europe. Access to software determines who may participate in a digital "
"society. Therefore the freedoms to use, copy, modify and redistribute "
"software&mdash;as described in the Free Software definition&mdash;allow "
"equal participation in the information age. Creating awareness for these "
"issues, securing Free Software politically and legally, and giving people "
"freedom by supporting development of Free Software are central issues of the "
"FSF Europe, which was founded in 2001 as the European sister organization of "
"the Free Software Foundation in the United States."

"The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting "
"computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer "
"programs.  The FSF promotes the development and use of free (as in freedom) "
"software&mdash;particularly the GNU operating system and its GNU/Linux "
"variants&mdash;and free documentation for free software.  The FSF also helps "
"to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the "
"use of software.  Their web site, located at <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org\">http://www.gnu.org</a>, is an important source "

"GNU/Linux is the integrated combination of the GNU operating system with the "
"kernel, Linux, written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  The various versions of "
"GNU/Linux have an estimated 20 million users."

"Some people call the GNU/Linux system &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, but this misnomer "
"leads to confusion (people cannot tell whether you mean the whole system or "
"the kernel, one part), and spreads an inaccurate picture of how, when and "
"where the system was developed.  Making a consistent distinction between "
"GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel, is the best "
"way to clear up the confusion.  See <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html</a> "
