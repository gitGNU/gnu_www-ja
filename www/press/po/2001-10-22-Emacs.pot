"Richard Stallman developed the original Emacs text editor in 1975 while "
"working at MIT.  Emacs, first developed in 1975, is an extensible text "
"editor that allows the user to program editing commands.  The original Emacs "
"used TECO as the user programming language.  GNU Emacs, which uses Lisp as "
"the user programming language, was started in September 1984 as part of "
"developing the GNU operating system."

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Emacs has undergone continuous development since that time, and has been "
"improved based on user bug reports and contributions from the Free Software "
"community.  Emacs 19 added support for multiple frames using the X Windowing "
"System.  Emacs 20 added multi-lingual support."

"Some people call the GNU/Linux system &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, but this misnomer "

"GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel, is the best "
