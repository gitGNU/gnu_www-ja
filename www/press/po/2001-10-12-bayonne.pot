"GNUCOMM, a subsystem of GNU, provides free software solutions to common "

"scalable and configurable enough to allow end-users to develop their own "
"telecommunications systems with little or no special knowledge of GNUCOMM's "
"internals.  GNUCOMM will support both VoIP and PSTN interfaces, as well as "
"interfaces to existing phone systems.  GNUCOMM will scale from individual "
"user installations to carrier-class sites.  The website of GNUCOMM is "
