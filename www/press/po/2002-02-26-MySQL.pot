"<strong>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</strong> - <em>Tuesday, February, 26, "
"2002</em> - Eben Moglen, General Counsel to the Free Software Foundation "
"(FSF), will testify as an expert witness in the Progress Software "
"Corporation vs. MySQL AB case currently pending in United States District "
"Court in Massachusetts.  The current focus of this case is a preliminary "
"injunction sought by MySQL AB concerning a violation of the GNU General "
"Public License (GPL) by Progress Software Corp."

"Progress lost the right to distibute MySQL due to a violation of the GNU "
"GPL.  Progress distributed a proprietary software component, Gemini, that "
"combined with the GPL'ed MySQL database system.  Gemini was linked "
"statically with the MySQL system to form a single binary program.  Many "
"times, the FSF has enforced the GNU GPL in such situations, when our "
"copyrights were at stake.  We do such enforcement in a confidential setting "
"without the need of court action.  Since Progress distributes no "
"FSF-copyrighted code, the FSF is not a party in the case; however, the FSF "
"takes a strong position that Progress is indeed in violation of the GNU GPL."

"Moglen said: &ldquo;In our minds, Progress Software Corp. has committed a "
"garden-variety violation of the GNU GPL.  We expect to prevail as we assist "
"MySQL AB in their enforcement action.  We are quite surprised that Progress "
"has brought the action this far.&rdquo;"
