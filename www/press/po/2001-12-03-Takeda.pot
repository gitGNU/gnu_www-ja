"embedded systems.  Linus Torvalds is honored for his work on the operating "
"system kernel called Linux, which is normally used together with GNU.  The "

"can work full time promoting software freedom and coordinating the GNU "
"project.  Stallman receives no salary nor travel expenses from the FSF and "
"assumes a modest living style to facilitate his continued work championing "
"the cause of free software."

"Some people call the GNU/Linux system &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, but this misnomer "
"leads to confusion (people cannot tell whether you mean the whole system or "
"the kernel, one part), and spreads an inaccurate picture of how, when and "
"where the system was developed.  Making a consistent distinction between "
"GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel, is the best "
"way to clear up the confusion.  See <a "
