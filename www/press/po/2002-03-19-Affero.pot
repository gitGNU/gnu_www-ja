"<strong>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</strong> - <em>Tuesday, March 19th, "
"2002</em> - The Free Software Foundation (FSF) announces support for and "
"invites public comment on the first public license designed to protect "
"software distributed as web services: the Affero General Public License "
"(AGPL).  The AGPL combines the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) V2 with "
"one additional provision to address software used by the public over a "
"network. The new provision enables the author to ensure that users will have "
"the right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute that software, by "
"providing a mechanism for downloading the source and restricting the removal "
"of the mechanism."

"The FSF has worked since its inception in 1985 to promote freedom for "
"computer users to share and change software.  In January, 1989, the FSF "
"released the GNU GPL Version 1.  It empowered free software developers by "
"providing a mechanism which ensured that all users be entitled to use, "
"study, copy, modify, and redistribute the software."

"The FSF modified the license in 1991 to meet changes in technology and "
"business, with the goal to continue the protection of users' freedoms.  The "
"license has since been adopted by thousands of software developers, from "
"individuals to large organizations such as IBM (NYSE: IBM)."

"Eben Moglen, board member and general legal counsel to the Free Software "
"Foundation, said: &ldquo;We are eager to solve problems experienced by free "
"software companies, like Affero, who are exploring new business models and "
"meeting new challenges that threaten the freedom of software.&rdquo;"

"Affero is delivering a new online service which empowers members of virtual "
"communities to recognize and reward positive contributions with feedback and "
"donations to non-profits and the causes they support. The company, committed "
"to the idealism embodied in the GNU GPL, requires full protection of "
"software freedom for their user and partner community.  Because Affero's "
"service is run over a network by their users, Affero needed the additional "
"provision to the GNU GPL.  The FSF worked with Affero to address the "
"licensing requirements for their business model and is considering including "
"this additional provision in the upcoming version of the GNU GPL 3.0 and is "
"inviting public comment."

"Affero's software enables any user to download its complete source code on "
"any screen in the user interface.  The new licensing provision protects the "
"removal of this feature, ensuring that the existing software and any "
"derivative works continue to be available to the general public under the "
"same terms as the original work.  &ldquo;As an advocate for the individual, "
"full access to Affero's source code is essential to our service&rdquo; "
"comments Henri Poole, President of Affero.  &ldquo;We are building tools to "
"reward sharing and enable more effective community dialogue, and these "
"communities and their members should be fully empowered to run, copy, "
"distribute, study, change and improve the software.  With new web-delivered "
"services, we need a license which will weld the virtual door open.&rdquo;"
