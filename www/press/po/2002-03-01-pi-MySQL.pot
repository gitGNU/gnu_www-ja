"<strong>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</strong> - <em>Friday, March, 1, "
"2002</em> - In a decision handed down today in Boston, US District Judge "
"Patti B. Saris ruled on the preliminary injunction motion in MySQL AB "
"vs. Progress Software Corp.  On the trademark dispute, on which the Free "
"Software Foundation (FSF) takes no position, she has ruled that Progress "
"Software is enjoined from marketing products under the MySQL trademarks "
"until trial."

"On the matter of Progress' distribution rights under GNU GPL, she has not "
"granted an injunction.  In the public hearing this week, Judge Saris made "
"clear that she sees the GNU GPL to be an enforceable and binding license, "
"but that as long as Progress Software appears to be presently in compliance "
"with the GNU GPL, there is probably no irreparable harm being caused to "
"MySQL AB.  Since Progress did previously distribute in violation of the GNU "
"GPL and thus did harm MySQL AB and the Free Software community, the FSF "
"expects MySQL to prevail at trial on these claims.  The Court recognizes in "
"today's order that MySQL &ldquo;seems to have the better argument&rdquo;."

"The Court fully recognized the need for expert testimony at trial about the "
"GNU GPL and the technical facts at hand, particularly as to why static "
"linking of software components into a single, unified, compiled binary forms "
"a derivative work of the original components.  As publishers of the GNU GPL "
"and defenders of software freedom, the FSF has a basic ethical imperative to "
"educate the public and the judiciary about the license and its terms.  The "
"FSF respects the due process of law, and thus plans to continue to offer our "
"General Counsel as an expert witness; Professor Moglen has donated his time "
"to the MySQL legal team, as he donates his time to the Foundation, for the "
"public good.  The FSF believes that the best way to serve the Free Software "
"community is to educate and clear up common misconceptions about the GNU "
"GPL, and will continue to do so despite attacks from those who oppose "
"software freedom."
