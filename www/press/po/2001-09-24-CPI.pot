"&ldquo;If code is law, then the real question we must face is: who should "

"&ldquo;Software today can control the way the world lives, communicates and "

"is typically secret&mdash;you can't change it, or even see what it really "
"does.  You can't tell if it has back doors, or sends your personal "
"information to a server on the net.  You cannot even prevent changes that "
"are detrimental, such as a future version unable to access the files you are "

"&ldquo;Free Software provides a democratic alternative.  The GNU General "
"Public License, or GPL, was specifically designed to make sure the public's "
"right to the software freedoms we feel are vital in a free society are "
"defended and upheld for everyone.  I use the expression &lsquo;free "
"society&rsquo; deliberately in this context, so there will be no "
"misunderstanding about the meaning of the word &lsquo;free&rsquo; in "
"&lsquo;Free Software&rsquo;.  It refers to freedom&mdash;the freedom to use, "
"study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.  We are not opposed "
"to profit or to business, but business must respect the public's freedom and "
"community if it is to be legitimate.&rdquo;"

"Dr.  Stallman will explain what Free Software means, briefly give its "

"Tony Stanco, Esq., Founder of FreeDevelopers.net and Senior Policy Analyst "
"of the Cyberspace Policy Institute says, &ldquo;The moral question between "
"Free and proprietary software ultimately revolves around this issue: Is "
"software more like law? (Which ought to be Free and open to public "
"inspection, so that the public can participate in the formation of the "
"social contract by which they will be governed).  Or is it more like "
"literature? (Which has been traditionally viewed as the creator's private "
"property).  It's increasingly clear that with the Internet, software has "
"begun to supplement the traditional function of law and that digital "
"machines are fast becoming a nonhuman, cyberpolice force watching and "
"directing everything people do."

"&ldquo;The Cyberspace Policy Institute decided to sponsor this conference so "

"Tony Stanco will also say a few words on: Why the world's richest company is "
"attacking the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) by calling it a "
"&ldquo;cancer&rdquo;, a &ldquo;destroyer&rdquo; of innovation, "
"&ldquo;anti-American&rdquo;? Whether this is true, or whether Microsoft "
"dislikes the GPL because the four freedoms it establishes for computer users "
"make monopolies hard to sustain? How Free Software created products, like "
"the GNU/Linux operating system, that compete with Microsoft's Windows on "
"heavy-duty servers in the back office? Why the principles of the new "
"Intellectual Age are fundamentally different from those of the previous "
"Industrial Age? Whether Software Freedom can restore innovation and "
"creativity to the software industry and provide a way to solve the Microsoft "
"antitrust question? Whether Microsoft's .Net initiative will inevitably "
"continue its monopoly? Or will Free Software's DotGNU project break the "
"Microsoft stranglehold and liberate computer users to control the software "
"they use?"

"Tony Stanco said, &ldquo;We invited Microsoft to send a representative to "
"join in the conference, because it seemed unfortunate that Craig Mundie, VP "

"accepted our invitation to date, but he is still welcome.  It's an open "
