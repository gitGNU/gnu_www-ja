"Richard M. Stallman today officially launched the Free Software Foundation "
"of India (FSF-India), the first affiliate in Asia of the Free Software "
"Foundation with a speech at the Freedom First! Conference on Free Software "
"in Trivandrum, Kerala, India.  Yesterday, he was received as an honored "
"state guest by government officials to discuss the philosophy behind the "
"movement and the use of free software as a viable, cost-effective "
"alternative for government, educational institutions, and businesses, as "
"well as for all the people of India."

"&ldquo;You are entitled to the freedom that free software gives you.&rdquo; "
"Stallman said.  It isn't just in India that people are entitled to an "
"alternative to proprietary software.  The inauguration of FSF-India is a "
"step forward in the expansion of the Free Software Foundation.  Free "
"software communities around the world are formally organizing, as FSF-India "
"has now done, with a goal of better assisting businesses, governments, and "
"educators everywhere to understand the philosophical ideals behind free "
"software and how these ideals directly create practical advantages to those "
"who use and create it. Stallman continued &ldquo;Computer users in India, as "
"elsewhere, deserve the freedom to share and change software, the way cooks "
"share and change recipes.  So I am pleased to inaugurate the Free Software "
"Foundation of India, which will promote the use and the development of free "
"software in this country.  At first, FSF-India will help individuals, "
"communities, schools, governments and enterprises in India make use of the "
"free software that the rest of the world has already developed.  Over time, "
"FSF-India will lead Indian programmers to contribute to the human knowledge "
"that free software represents.&rdquo;"

"&ldquo;We feel a developing country like India has a special stake in "
"promoting and encouraging the use of free software,&rdquo; said Satish Babu, "
"of FSF-India.  &ldquo;It also is a plus, of course, that there are no "
"software license fees to pay.  This is of great importance now that "
"proprietary software companies are switching to a licensing business model "
"for software, meaning you must in effect rent the software and continue to "
"pay for it forever.  With free software, if you wish, you can download the "
"software for free, or if a business or school wishes to buy one CD, it can "
"legally install the same CD in every computer on site, without having to pay "
"one penny to anyone, ever again.  But there are deeper, more significant "
"benefits.  Here in India, we do need to constantly strive for cost-effective "
"solutions.  The digital divide is of concern everywhere but especially is it "
"so here in India.  Unless we act, the digital divide in India is likely to "
"widen, particularly so because of the country's many languages and its "
"uneven literacy levels.  Free software can help level the playing field for "
"emerging nations like India and bridge this divide by encouraging "
"solidarity, collaboration and voluntary community work amongst programmers "
"and computer users and invigorate an indigenous software industry.&rdquo;"

"&ldquo;Schools in India can benefit by redistributing free software to save "
"on license fees&rdquo;, Stallman said.  &ldquo;But free software offers a "
"deeper benefit for education: the knowledge in free software is public "
"knowledge, not secret.  The sealed black box of a proprietary software "
"system is designed to keep people in the dark.  With free software, students "
"can study the software they use, to learn how it works.  They can write "
"improvements to the software, and thus learn the craft of software "
"development&mdash;which usually consists of improving existing "
"programs.&rdquo;"

"Some people call the GNU/Linux system &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, but this misnomer "
