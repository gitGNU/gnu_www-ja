"<strong>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</strong> - <em>Monday, July 9, 2001</em> "
"- The Free Software Foundation announced today the support of two Free "
"Software projects, Mono and DotGNU, that will offer Free Software "
"alternatives to components of Microsoft's .NET system.  The Mono and DotGNU "
"projects will each offer different but complementary solutions."

"The Mono Project is a community initiative to develop a Free Software, "
"GNU/Linux-based version of the Microsoft .NET development platform.  "
"Incorporating key .NET compliant components, including a C# compiler, a "
"Common Language Runtime just-in-time compiler, and a full suite of class "
"libraries, the Mono Project will enable developers to create .NET "
"applications and run them on Windows or any Mono-supported platform, "
"including GNU/Linux and Unix. The Mono Project is led by Ximian, the Free "
"Software company co-founded by Miguel de Icaza, who has led GNU's GNOME "
"desktop environment to great success. The URL for the project is "
"http://www.go-mono.net."

"The DotGNU Project is a community initiative to develop Free Software "
"enabling decentralized services and authentication. The DotGNU Project is "
"led by David Sugar, who also maintains Bayonne, the GNU telephony system, "
"and has recently been named the CTO of FreeDevelopers. DotGNU is centered at "
"Savannah, the GNU developer collaboration site. The URL for Savannah is "
"http://savannah.gnu.org."

"Richard M. Stallman, founder of the GNU project and president of the Free "
"Software Foundation, said: &ldquo;With Mono and DotGNU, we hope to provide "
"good alternatives to components of .NET, ones that will respect your "
"freedom, and your privacy.  You will be able to use the facilities of Mono "
"and DotGNU either with, or without, the Internet, and using servers of your "
"choice.&rdquo;"

"&ldquo;We are taking the lead in providing an upgraded development platform "
"that enables Unix and GNU/Linux developers to capitalize on the .NET "
"framework. By having the Mono Project reuse the work from the GNU and GNOME "
"project, we can greatly accelerate the development process,&rdquo; said "
"Miguel de Icaza, co-founder and chief technical officer at Ximian."

"Stallman added: &ldquo;Mono will enable you to run your C# programs on the "
"free GNU/Linux operating system using exclusively free software.  With Mono, "
"you will be able to use C# if you wish, without surrendering your freedom to "
"study, share, change, and generally control all the software that you "
"use.&rdquo;"

"Sugar noted that DotGNU will avoid the centralization of services threatened "
"by .NET, saying: &ldquo;We see no technological reason to have services "
"hosted and deployed from a single service provider.  DotGNU will scale so "
"that anyone can develop and deploy network services, whether they be an "
"individual, large corporation, small business or government.  Distributed "
"authentication can assure users' freedom and privacy, as well as the privacy "
"and integrity for commercial and government organizations.&rdquo;"

"These two GNU efforts will insure that both commercial and non-commercial "

"GNU/Linux is the integrated combination of the GNU operating system with the "

"Some people call the GNU/Linux system &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, but this misnomer "
"leads to confusion (people cannot tell whether you mean the whole system or "
"the kernel, one part), and spreads an inaccurate picture of how, when and "
"where the system was developed.  Making a consistent distinction between "
"GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel, is the best "
"way to clear up the confusion."
