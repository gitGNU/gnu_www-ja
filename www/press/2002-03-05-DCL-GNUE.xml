<Body>
  <Para>
Double Choco Latte (DCL), a work order and help desk management
system, today announced that it will be merging into GNU Enterprise
(GNUe), a GNU Package.  These two projects give individual and
corporate users software freedom for enterprise applications through
the GNU General Public License, which grants and defends users'
freedoms to copy, share, modify, and redistribute software.
  </Para>
  <Para>
"DCL has always had a vision of creating an integrated set of 
applications," said Michael Dean, Lead Developer of Double Choco Latte, 
"The merging of these two projects will accelerate the process of making 
that vision a reality.  Additionally, the GNUe tools will provide a very 
robust and customizable framework on which to build, integrate, and extend 
DCL in ways that would have required significantly more development effort.  
GNUe and DCL together will help create solutions that meet the requirements 
of an organization's ERP or CRM needs."
  </Para>
  <Para>
By putting DCL under the GNUe umbrella, additional resources will be
immediately devoted to it.  DCL and its existing PHP interfaces will
quickly be available under the GNUe Application Framework.  DCL will be
better modularized.  Stronger customer management and billing/invoicing 
by project/work order will be the first of many new features.  DCL will become the project management package of GNUe and will use GNUe modules for many of its components.
  </Para>
  <Para>
"From my first experience with DCL I had a feeling that there was a lot to 
be gained by combining our projects," said Derek Neighbors, co-maintainer 
of GNU Enterprise,"and after many late nights with the DCL team, we all 
realized it just makes sense to work together.  The DCL team was filling a 
lot of gaps in the GNUe vision that we just hadn't had the time to focus on,
and we were able to offer a lot of immediate input into DCL to help make 
it more rounded."
  </Para>
  <Para>
The combining of talent from both of these free software projects should 
only help accelerate the development of much needed free software 
enterprise applications.  By increasing the breadth of enterprise 
applications that are under a free software license, users are given options
to proprietary software that adversely restrict them and their businesses. 
Adding the additional talent and visions to both projects only helps expand 
the offerrings of integrated, yet modular, solutions for small to mid 
size enterprises.  
  </Para>
<About topic="GNU Enterprise">
  <Para>
GNU Enterprise (GNUe) is a suite of tools and applications for solving the 
specific needs of the enterprise.  From human resources, accounting, 
customer relationship management and project management to supply chain 
or e-commerce, GNUe can handle the needs of any business, large or small.
  </Para>
  <Para>
Beyond applications, GNUe is a development framework that enables 
enterprise information technology professionals to customize applications 
for their businesses.  The GNUe platform boasts an open architecture and 
easy maintenance.  It gives users a modular system and freedom from being 
stuck with a single-source vendor.  Plus, users get consistency and the 
ability to tap into a network of best practices from other enterprises, 
saving valuable development time.

</About>

<About topic="GNU/Linux">
<Para>
  GNU/Linux is the integrated combination of the GNU operating system with
  the kernel, Linux, written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  The various
  versions of GNU/Linux have an estimated 20 million users.
</Para>
<Para>
  Some people call the GNU/Linux system "Linux", but this misnomer leads to
  confusion (people cannot tell whether you mean the whole system or the
  kernel, one part), and spreads an inaccurate picture of how, when and
  where the system was developed.  Making a consistent distinction between
  GNU/Linux, the whole operating system, and Linux, the kernel, is the best
  way to clear up the confusion.  See
  <URL>http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html</URL> for more
  explanation.
