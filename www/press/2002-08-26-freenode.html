    The Free Software Foundation is pleased to announce that, as of today,
    the GNU Project will begin using Freenode as its official IRC network.
    For years, this network has served as an unofficial IRC home to many
    GNU projects.  Today, it becomes the official recommended IRC network
    for GNU packages.
   <p>
   
    Bradley M. Kuhn, executive director of the Free Software Foundation,
    pointed out: "The GNU Project has long sought an IRC network aligned
    with our strong stand for the principles of software freedom.  We
    believe that Freenode, with its commitment to providing an innovative
    venue for Free Software developers and like-minded individuals to
    cooperate, fits the bill."
   <p>
   
    Robert Levin, president of Peer-Directed Projects Center, added: "We
    welcome the opportunity to work more closely with the Free Software
    Foundation.  Licensing that preserves freedom is essential to the health
    and success of peer-directed projects.  The Free Software Foundation's
    pivotal role in advocating software freedom makes it a valued
    contributor to the community."
   <p>
   
    To implement this official relationship, FSF has pointed irc.gnu.org
    directly to the irc.freenode.net server.  FSF also hopes to later
    implement some process for automatic channel registration for GNU
    projects through its savannah.gnu.org project collaboration site.

    Freenode provides interactive services to peer-directed projects,
    which combine open, informal participation with broad licensing and
    wide distribution of creative output.  Freenode serves such
    software-related projects as DotGNU, XFS, Subversion, Source Mage
    GNU/Linux, Schoolforge and GNU Enterprise, as well as support groups
    for FreeBSD, GNU/Linux and various software applications.  Freenode,
    formerly Open Projects Net, is a service of Peer-Directed Projects
    Center, a Texas non-profit corporation.
