   <Para>
     Eben Moglen, General Counsel to the Free Software Foundation (FSF),
     will testify as an expert witness in the Progress Software
     Corporation vs. MySQL AB case currently pending in United States
     District Court in Massachusetts.  The current focus of this case is a
     preliminary injunction sought by MySQL AB concerning a violation of
     the GNU General Public License (GPL) by Progress Software Corp.
    </Para>
    <Para>
    Progress lost the right to distibute MySQL due to a violation of the
    GNU GPL.  Progress distributed a proprietary software component,
    Gemini, that combined with the GPL'ed MySQL database system.  Gemini
    was linked statically with the MySQL system to form a single binary
    program.  Many times, the FSF has enforced the GNU GPL in such
    situations, when our copyrights were at stake.  We do such enforcement
    in a confidential setting without the need of court action.  Since
    Progress distributes no FSF-copyrighted code, the FSF is not a party
    in the case; however, the FSF takes a strong position that Progress is
    indeed in violation of the GNU GPL.
   </Para>
   <Para>
     Moglen said: "In our minds, Progress Software Corp. has committed a
     garden-variety violation of the GNU GPL.  We expect to prevail as we
     assist MySQL AB in their enforcement action.  We are quite surprised
     that Progress has brought the action this far."
   </Para>
   <Para>
     The preliminary injunction hearing will take place at 2:00 PM on
     Wednesday, February, 27, 2002 at the Federal Court House in Boston,
     Massachusetts in the court of Judge Patti B. Saris.
   </Para>
   <Para>
     Moglen's full affidavit in this case is available at
     <URL>http://www.fsf.org/press/mysql-affidavit.html</URL>.  Moglen's
     full essay about enforcing the GNU GPL is available at
