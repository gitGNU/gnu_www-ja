IBM in New York</h1><h2></h2><strong>Boston, MA, USA</strong> - <i>Friday, January 2, 2004</i> - 


The Free Software Foundation (FSF) will host two seminars on Free Software
Licensing and the GNU GPL and a series of conversations with Professor
Eben Moglen on the SCO v. IBM lawsuit.  These events will take place at
Columbia Law School in New York City on January 20 and 21, 2004.

<p>


In the last few months, the Santa Cruz Organization Group (SCO) has been
sowing confusion and misinformation regarding the validity of the GNU
General Public License (GPL) as part of their strategy to extort money
from users of the kernel named Linux, which is licensed under FSF's GPL.
These seminars and discussions will present the facts about the license
from FSF, its creators, who authored the license in 1989.  Today, the GNU
GPL is the most popular and widely used Free Software copyright license.

<p>


The seminars will provide detailed study and analysis of the GPL, review
GPL enforcement cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance Laboratory, and
consider legal ethics in Free Software Licensing.  Daniel Ravicher, Senior
Counsel to FSF, and Bradley M. Kuhn, Executive Director of FSF, will lead
the seminars.
<p>


The first seminar, "Detailed Study and Analysis of GPL and LGPL", held on
January 20, 2004, will give a section-by-section explanation of the GPL,
and will educate lawyers, software developers, managers and business
people on how to use the GPL (and GPL'd software) successfully in new Free
Software businesses and in existing, successful enterprises.

<p>


The second seminar, "GPL Compliance Case Studies and Legal Ethics in Free
Software Licensing" held on January 21, 2004, will present the details of
a few different GPL compliance cases handled by FSF's GPL Compliance
Laboratory.  Each case offers unique insights into problems that arise
when the terms of the GPL are not properly followed, and how diplomatic
negotiation between the violator and the copyright holder can yield
positive results for both parties. This seminar also includes a unit on
the ethical considerations for attorneys who want to represent clients
that make, use, or sell Free Software products.

<p>


FSF will also host "SCO Without Fear", a series of two
lunchtime conversations with Professor Eben Moglen, who serves on FSF's
Board and as its General Counsel.  He will discuss the SCO v. IBM lawsuit
and SCO's attacks on Free Software, and their implications for the
development and use of Free Software.  Some of Prof. Moglen's earlier
writings on the SCO v. IBM lawsuit can be found at
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/sco/sco.html">http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/sco/sco.html</a>.  These
conversations will also be held on January 20-21, 2004 at Columbia
University in New York.
