           freedom to businesses, large enterprises and commercial
           telephone carriers
</h1><h2></h2><strong>Bayonne, NJ, USA</strong> - <i>Tuesday, September 3, 2002</i> - 
   After two years of active development, the GNU project has
     released GNU Bayonne, Version 1.0.  GNU Bayonne, licensed freely
     under the GNU General Public License (GPL), allows small businesses,
     large enterprises, and commercial telephone carriers to create,
     deploy, and manage their own web-integrated telephony voice response
     solutions.  By making use of existing computer telephony commercially
     available for GNU/Linux, Bayonne can support all capacities -- from a
     single analog phone circuit to multiple PRI spans.<p>

  As part of GNU Enterprise (GNUe), Bayonne 1.0 joins the ranks of a
     host of enterprise-level software for the popular GNU/Linux operating
     system.  "In this 1.0 release, we have established a Free Software
     platform for the delivery of quality telephony services everywhere",
     said David Sugar, GNU Bayonne project leader.  "We are committed to
     establishing Free Software as the primary means to advance
     telecommunications services as part of enterprise software
     infrastructure that respects software freedom, and supports both
     current and next generation telephone networks".<p>

  GNU Bayonne is a free software project and has been developed by
     volunteers around the world.  These volunteers cooperate with other
     Free Software development groups, including those working on Carrier
     Grade extensions for the kernel named Linux.  Meanwhile, a number of
     organizations and individuals have contributed resources and time to
     create GNU Bayonne 1.0.  The Free Software Foundation and the GNU
     project have provided technical, infrastructure, and organizational
     support for GNU Bayonne development.  The Open Source Telecom
     Corporation has provided commercial sponsorship of GNU Bayonne
     development.<p>

  GNU Bayonne can be obtained in source code form directly from
     <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bayonne/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bayonne/</a>.  It include in many popular
     GNU/Linux and FreeBSD distributions, including the Official Debian
