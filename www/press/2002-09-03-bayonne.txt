       GNU Bayonne 1.0 Released; GNU Telephony Server gives software               freedom to businesses, large enterprises and commercial                                  telephone carriers

Bayonne, NJ, USA - Tuesday, September 3, 2002 - After two years of active
development, the GNU project has released GNU Bayonne, Version 1.0.
GNU Bayonne, licensed freely under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
allows small businesses, large enterprises, and commercial telephone
carriers to create, deploy, and manage their own web-integrated telephony
voice response solutions.  By making use of existing computer telephony
commercially available for GNU/Linux, Bayonne can support all capacities
-- from a single analog phone circuit to multiple PRI spans.

As part of GNU Enterprise (GNUe), Bayonne 1.0 joins the ranks of a host
of enterprise-level software for the popular GNU/Linux operating system.
"In this 1.0 release, we have established a Free Software platform for
the delivery of quality telephony services everywhere", said David Sugar,
GNU Bayonne project leader.  "We are committed to establishing Free
Software as the primary means to advance telecommunications services
as part of enterprise software infrastructure that respects software
freedom, and supports both current and next generation telephone
networks".

GNU Bayonne is a free software project and has been developed by
volunteers around the world.  These volunteers cooperate with other
Free Software development groups, including those working on Carrier
Grade extensions for the kernel named Linux.  Meanwhile, a number of
organizations and individuals have contributed resources and time to
create GNU Bayonne 1.0.  The Free Software Foundation and the GNU project
have provided technical, infrastructure, and organizational support
for GNU Bayonne development.  The Open Source Telecom Corporation has
provided commercial sponsorship of GNU Bayonne development.

GNU Bayonne can be obtained in source code form directly from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bayonne/.  It include in many popular GNU/Linux and
FreeBSD distributions, including the Official Debian GNU/Linux system.
