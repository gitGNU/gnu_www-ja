Those of you in the SF Bay Area may have noticed that Herb Caen has
discovered the little smileys that computer-people use in e-mail, and
has been both using them in his column and collecting interesting ones.
 Some ones I hadn't seen before (mixed with a few I made up):

:-D	very happy

:-{	very sad	

:-I	vexed

8-0	incredulous

B-)	Gary Larson glasses

S:-}	Dudley Do-right

[:-)	M.C. Hammer

7:-)	Reagan

/:=	Hitler

%:*D	Bozo

O:-)	Jesus

}:-)	The Devil

And, if you turn them over:

(-:P	Beaver Cleaver

(-:]P	Spike Lee

(-:?	Elvis	

(-:C	Viking

(-:K	My Favorite Martian

(-:E	King Hussein

(-:B	Felix the Cat

Enough!

:-þ (raspberry 2)

ò_ó (angry)

ó_ò (concerned)

ô_ô (somewhat surprised)

õ_õ (intrigued)

ñ_ñ (but then there's this much cuter "happy")

ß-) (on some character sets, this looks like a face wearing
goggles)

ø_ø (Stoner McNullset)

ù_ú (Upset but holding it in)

ú_ù (Meditating, kissing, or various others)
