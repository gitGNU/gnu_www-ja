<div class="lyrics">
<p>
I was taught assembler<br />
in my second year of school.<br />
It's kinda like construction work &mdash;<br />
with a toothpick for a tool.<br />
So when I made my senior year,<br />
I threw my code away,<br />
And learned the way to program<br />
that I still prefer today.<br />
</p>
<p>
Now, some folks on the Internet<br />
put their faith in C++.<br />
They swear that it's so powerful,<br />
it's what God used for us.<br />
And maybe it lets mortals dredge<br />
their objects from the C.<br />
But I think that explains<br />
why only God can make a tree.<br />
</p>
<p>
For God wrote in Lisp code<br />
When he filled the leaves with green.<br />
The fractal flowers and recursive roots:<br />
The most lovely hack I've seen.<br />
And when I ponder snowflakes,<br />
never finding two the same,<br />
I know God likes a language<br />
with its own four-letter name.<br />
</p>
<p>
Now, I've used a SUN under Unix,<br />
so I've seen what C can hold.<br />
I've surfed for Perls, found what Fortran's for,<br />
Got that Java stuff down cold.<br />
Though the chance that I'd write COBOL code<br />
is a SNOBOL's chance in Hell.<br />
And I basically hate hieroglyphs,<br />
so I won't use APL.<br />
</p>
<p>
Now, God must know all these languages,<br />
and a few I haven't named.<br />
But the Lord made sure, when each sparrow falls,<br />
that its flesh will be reclaimed.<br />
And the Lord could not count grains of sand<br />
with a 32-bit word.<br />
Who knows where we would go to<br />
if Lisp weren't what he preferred?<br />
</p>
<p>
And God wrote in Lisp code<br />
Every creature great and small.<br />
Don't search the disk drive for man.c,<br />
When the listing's on the wall.<br />
And when I watch the lightning burn<br />
Unbelievers to a crisp,<br />
I know God had six days to work,<br />
So he wrote it all in Lisp.<br />
</p>
<p>
Yes, God had a deadline.<br />
So he wrote it all in Lisp.</p>
