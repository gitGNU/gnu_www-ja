"I am representing the Swedish YAAS foundation and we would like to address "
"an important issue that came up last week when our tech crew were going over "
"the source code for your GNU software.  It appears that you have been using "
"a patented technique of ours and we can not accept this kind of behaviour.  "
"The patented Hello World technique used in many programming languages was "
"found in numerous of your projects source codes."

"We are not unreasonable Mr.Stallman, all we demand is 50 000 in unmarked US "
"dollars delivered in a brief case to the dumpster behind McDonalds in "
"Springfield, IL.  Failure to comply will result in us taking action and most "
"possibly cutting off a piece of your beard in your sleep and cloning you for "
"fun.  We hope that you take upon this as seriously as we do Mr.Stallman and "
"we wish you a good day."
