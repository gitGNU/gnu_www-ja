"One late rainy night I had an idea.  There is a hill on IL route 29 in "
"Peoria IL, that people climb and write a small message across this hill for "
"everyone to view from a far.  What would be better than spreading my two "
"most favorite words across this hill.  So we set out with a little over 200 "
"garbage bags and nearly 400 nails.  12:30am and rainy so you can figure that "
"a hill of that size is going to be slippery (lol) nearly falling down hill "
"with every stepp we start building each letter.  At around 2:30am we have "
"finished and now the sun will rise over a hill which spreads the words Free "
"Software to every person that passes by.  This is by far a vary small "
"non-complex hack but I beleve it is a hack in it self.  This is a tribute to "
"Free Software [and the GNU Project]."
