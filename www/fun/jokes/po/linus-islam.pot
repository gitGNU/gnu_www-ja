"Linus Torvalds, joining such other pioneers as Cat Stevens, and Sammy Davis "
"Jr., has converted to Islam.  As a result, he has now renounced his prior "
"work in furthering the &ldquo;open source movement&rdquo; and revoked the "
"licence for use of his Linux kernel."

"When reached for comment, the notorious recluse stated that he aims to "
"re-issue the licence in the near future once the kernel has been adapted so "
"as not to function with uses which are contrary to Islam as he interprets "
"it.  What future remains for the GNU project remains unclear, although "
"insiders note that it sharpens the distinctions between the open source "
"compared with the free software movement.  Speaking off the record, the "
"source expanded on the &ldquo;knife-edge&rdquo; or &ldquo;house of "
"cards&rdquo; on which the open source movement is built, dependent on a "
"small span of traditional rights, whereas the free software movement "
"encourages more broad, cultural change, which, he felt, may inspire new ways "
"to address the current conundrum."

"When asked if this is the beginning of a macro-fragmentation of Linux some "
"wonder if this is not already occurring now, and raise the issue of China "
"and its parallel standards to accepted protocols.  Others point to the "
"eventual expiration of the protected rights which are key to all &ldquo;open "
"source&rdquo; software, so that Linus Torvald's conversion should serve as a "
"wake-up call as to the broader problem &mdash; a kind of Linux Y2K &mdash; "
"even if a new kernel is reverse-engineered to replace the Torvalds kernel."

"One free software ideologue summarized the current situation as that most "
"people think of the relationship between the open source movement and the "
"free software movement as like that between socialism and communism.  "
"Instead, he argues, we should see the open source movement as like boosters "
"of movable type (as both spread a form of technological literacy.)  The free "
"software movement, in contrast, promotes the culture of public libraries, "
"including with respect to software.  Obviously public libraries benefited "
"from movable type, but they are not limited to such productions, he added.  "
"How much publishing drives reading patterns or reading drives publishing "
"patterns is an open debate, he concluded, although he suggested an "
"historical review of that dynamic might be fruitful in suggesting new "
"interactions between open source and free software, as competing views."

"Critical of the Eric Raymond model, which he says examined an empirical "
"case, the early growth of Linux, and distilled what he took to be the active "
"ingredient &mdash; massive independent peer review &mdash; he points out "
"that while such review may help debug software, that it doesn't inspire "
"software (nor new ideas in general) unlike a culture of freedom such as free "
"software promotes.  Additionally, open source only promotes peer review of "
"those who can afford access, whereas the free software movement encourages a "
"much wider peer review, and &ldquo;that's just better for software "
"too,&rdquo; this insider claims."

"Moreover, whereas the Raymond model is an outgrowth of an empirical case, "
"stalling actions in the inexorable development of software suggest to "
"developers that a revision of the model may be in order, with these hiccups "
"as the new empirical case to consider."

"Both the open source and free software movements were built by those with a "
"certain playfulness, both in computer terms, and linguistically.  One new "
"proponent suggests that the time is right for a new challenge, which he "
"terms, &ldquo;often aims.&rdquo; This manifesto he derives as follows: "
"habitual and often are synonymous, as are goals and aims.  Whereas a "
"manifesto is a statement of habitual goals, this translates as that a "
"manifesto is a statement of often aims, of which manifesto is its anagram."

"The often aims movement suggests that the open source and free software "
"movements are in a cultural cold war as to whether the way of thinking on "

"protection will be absent."

"The often aims perspective in considering the free software movement as a "
