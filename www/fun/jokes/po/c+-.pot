"C+- is a strongly typed language based on stereotyping and self-righteous "
"logic.  The Boolean variables <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> "
"(known as constants in less realistic languages)  are supplemented with "
"<code>CREDIBLE</code> and <code>DUBIOUS</code>, which are fuzzier than "
"Zadeh's traditional fuzzy categories.  All Booleans can be declared with the "
"modifiers strong and weak.  Weak implication is said to &ldquo;preserve "
"deniability&rdquo; and was added at the request of the D.O.D.  to ensure "
"compatability with future versions of Ada.  Well-formed falsehoods (WFFs) "
"are assignment-compatible with all Booleans.  What-if and why-not "
"interactions are aided by the special conditional evenifnot X then Y."
