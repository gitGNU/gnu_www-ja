"What's GNU?  Gnu's Not Unix.  Right On!\n"
"\n"
"GNU, which stands fo' Gnu's Not Unix, be de dojigger fo' de complete\n"
"Unix-compatible software system which ah' am writin' so's dat ah' can\n"
"give it away free t'everyone who kin use it.  Several oda' volunteers\n"
"are helpin' me.  What it is, Mama!  Contribushuns uh time, bre'd,\n"
"honky codes and equipment are greatly needed.\n"
"\n"
"So far we gots' an Emacs text edito' wid Lisp fo' writin' edito'\n"
"commands, a source level debugger, some yacc-compatible parsa'\n"
"generato', some linker, and around 35 utilities.  A shell (command\n"
"interpreter) be nearly completed.  A new po'table optimizin' C\n"
"compila' has compiled itself and may be released dis year.  Ah be\n"
"baaad...  An initial kernel 'esists but many mo'e features are needed\n"
"to emulate Unix.  When de kernel and compila' are finished, it gots'ta\n"
"be possible t'distribute some GNU system suitable fo' honky code\n"
"development.  We gots'ta use @TeX{} as our text fo'matter, but an\n"
"nroff be bein' wo'ked on.  'S coo', bro.  We gots'ta use da damn free,\n"
"po'table X window system as sheeit.  Afta' dis we will add some\n"
"po'table Common Lisp, an Empire game, some spreadsheet, and hundreds\n"
"of oda' din's, plus on-line documentashun.  We hope t'supply,\n"
"eventually, everydin' useful dat no'mally comes wid some Unix system,\n"
"and mo'e.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"GNU gots'ta be able t'run Unix honky codes, but gots'ta not be\n"
"identical t'Unix.  We gots'ta make all improvements dat are\n"
"convenient, based on our 'espuh'ience wid oda' opuh'tin' systems.  In\n"
"particular, we plan t'gots' longer stashdojiggers, stash version\n"
"numbers, some crashproof stash system, stashdojigger compleshun\n"
"puh'haps, terminal-independent display suppo't, and puh'haps\n"
"eventually some Lisp-based window system drough which several Lisp\n"
"honky codes and o'dinary Unix honky codes kin share some screen.  'S\n"
"coo', bro.  Bod C and Lisp gots'ta be available as system honky\n"
"codemin' languages.  We gots'ta try t'suppo't UUCP, MIT Chaosnet,\n"
"and Internet protocols fo' communicashun.\n"
"\n"
"GNU be aimed initially at machines in de 68000/16000 class wid virtual\n"
"memo'y, cuz' dey are da damn easiest machines t'make it run on.  'S\n"
"coo', bro.  De 'estra effo't t'make it run on little-assa' machines\n"
"gots'ta be left t'someone who wants's to use it on dem.  'S coo', bro.\n"

"To avoid ho'rible confusion, please pronounce da damn `G' in de wo'd\n"
"`GNU' when it be de dojigger uh dis project.\n"

"Who Am I?\n"
"\n"
"I's gots'ta be Richard Stallman, invento' uh de o'iginal much-imitated\n"
"EMACS edito', fo'merly at da damn Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.\n"
"ah' gots' wo'ked extensively on compilers, edito's, debuggers, command\n"
"interpreters, de Incompatible Timesharin' System and da damn Lisp\n"
"Machine opuh'tin' system.  'S coo', bro.  I pioneered terminal-\n"
"independent display suppo't in ITS.  Since den ah' gots' implemented\n"
"one crashproof stash system and two window systems fo' Lisp machines,\n"
"and designed some dird window system now bein' implemented; dis one\n"
"gots'ta be po'ted t'many systems includin' use in GNU.  ['Sup, dudes,\n"
"dig dis: De window system project wuz not completed; GNU now plans\n"
"t'use de X window system.  'S coo', bro.]\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Why ah' Must Write GNU\n"
"\n"
"I consida' dat da damn golden rule requires dat if ah' likes some\n"
"honky code ah' must share it wid oda' sucka's who likes it.  Software\n"
"sellers wanna divide de users and conqua' dem, makin' each usa' agree\n"
"not t'share wid oders.  ah' refuse t'boogie solidarity wid oda' users\n"
"in dis way.  Slap mah fro!  I cannot in baaaad conscience sign some\n"
"nondisclosho' nuff agreement o' some software license agreement.  Fo'\n"
"years ah' wo'ked widin de Artificial Intelligence Lab t'resist such\n"
"tendencies and oda' inhospitalities, but eventually dey had gone too\n"
"far, dig dis: ah' could not remain in an institushun where such din's\n"
"are done fo' me against mah' will.\n"
"\n"
"So dat ah' can continue t'use clunkers widout dishono', ah' gots'\n"
"decided to put togeda' a sufficient body uh free software so's dat ah'\n"
"gots'ta be able to get along widout any software dat be not free.\n"
"What it is, Mama!  ah' gots' resigned fum de AI lab t'deny MIT any\n"
"legal 'suse t'prevent me fum givin' GNU away.  Slap mah fro!\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Why GNU Will Be Compatible wid Unix\n"
"\n"
"Unix be not mah' ideal system, but it be not too bad-ass.  De\n"
"essential features of Unix seem t'be baaaad ones, and ah' dink ah' can\n"
"fill in whut Unix lacks widout spoilin' dem.  'S coo', bro.  And some\n"
"system compatible wid Unix would be convenient fo' many oda' sucka's\n"
"t'adopt.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"How GNU Will Be Available\n"
"\n"
"GNU be not in de public domain.  'S coo', bro.  Everyone gots'ta be\n"
"puh'mitted t'modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributo' gots'ta\n"
"be allowed t'restrict its furda' redistribushun.  Dat be to say,\n"
"proprietary modificashuns gots'ta not be allowed.  ah' wanna make sho'\n"
"nuff dat all versions uh GNU remain free.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Why Many Oda' Programmers Want t'Help\n"
"\n"
"I gots' found many oda' honky codemers who are 'sited about GNU and\n"
"wanna help.\n"
"\n"
"Many honky codemers are unhappy about da damn commercializashun uh\n"
"system software.  What it is, Mama!  It may enable dem t'make mo'e\n"
"bre'd, but it requires dem to feel in conflict wid oda' honky codemers\n"
"in general rada' dan feel as comrades.  De fundamental act uh\n"
"homeyship among honky codemers be de sharin' uh honky codes; marketin'\n"
"arrangements now typically used essentially fo'bid honky codemers\n"
"t'treat oders as homeys.  De purchasa' of software must choose between\n"
"homeyship and obeyin' de law.  Naturally, many decide dat homeyship be\n"
"mo'e impo'tant.  But dose who recon' in law often do not feel at ease\n"
"wid eida' choice.  What it is, Mama!  Dey become cynical and dink dat\n"
"honky codemin' be plum a way uh makin' bre'd.\n"
"\n"
"By wo'kin' on and usin' GNU rada' dan proprietary honky codes, we kin\n"
"be hospitable t'everyone and obey de law.  In addishun, GNU serves as\n"
"an example t'inspire and some banna' to rally oders t'join us in\n"
"sharin'.  Dis kin give us some feelin' uh harmony which be impossible\n"
"if we use software dat be not free.  What it is, Mama!  Fo' about half\n"
"de honky codemers ah' rap to, dis is an impo'tant happiness dat bre'd\n"
"kinnot replace.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"How You's Can Contribute\n"
"\n"
"I's gots'ta be ax'in' clunker manufacturers fo' donashuns uh machines\n"
"and bre'd.  I'm ax'in' individuals fo' donashuns uh honky codes and\n"
"wo'k.\n"
"\n"
"One consequence ya' kin 'espect if ya' donate machines be dat GNU\n"
"gots'ta run on dem at an early date.  What it is, Mama!  De machines\n"
"should be complete, ready t'use systems, approved fo' use in some\n"
"residential area, and not in need of sophisticated coolin' o' power.\n"
"Ah be baaad...\n"
"\n"
"I gots' found real many honky codemers eaga' to contribute part-time\n"
"wo'k fo' GNU.  Fo' most projects, such part-time distributed wo'k\n"
"would be real hard to coo'dinate; de independently-written parts would\n"
"not wo'k togeder.  Ah be baaad...  But fo' de particular tax' uh\n"
"replacin' Unix, dis problem be absent.  A complete Unix system\n"
"contains hundreds uh utility honky codes, each uh which is documented\n"
"separately.  Slap mah fro!  Most interface specificashuns are fixed by\n"
"Unix compatibility.  Slap mah fro!  If each contributo' kin scribble\n"
"some compatible replacement fo' a sin'le Unix utility, and make it\n"
"wo'k propuh'ly in place uh de o'iginal on some Unix system, den dese\n"
"utilities gots'ta wo'k right when put togeder.  Ah be baaad...  Even\n"
"allowin' fo' Murphy t'create some few un'spected problems, assemblin'\n"
"dese components gots'ta be some feasible tax'.  (De kernel gots'ta\n"
"require closer communicashun and gots'ta be wo'ked on by some\n"
"little-ass, tight grodown.)\n"
"\n"
"If ah' get donashuns uh bre'd, ah' may be able t'hire some few sucka's\n"
"full o' part time.  What it is, Mama!  De salary won't be high by\n"
"honky codemers' standards, but I'm lookin' fo' sucka's fo' whom\n"
"buildin' community spirit be as impo'tant as makin' bre'd.  ah' view\n"
"dis as some way uh enablin' dedicated sucka's t'devote deir full\n"
"energies t'wo'kin' on GNU by sparin' dem de need t'make a livin' in\n"
"anoda' way.  Slap mah fro!\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Why All Computa' Users Will Benefit\n"
"\n"
"Once GNU be written, everyone gots'ta be able t'obtain baaaad system\n"
"software free, plum likes air.  Ah be baaad...\n"
"\n"
"Dis means much mo'e dan plum savin' everyone da damn price uh a Unix\n"
"license.  What it is, Mama!  It means dat much wuzteful ddownlicashun\n"
"uh system honky codemin' effo't will be avoided.  Dis effo't kin go\n"
"instead into advancin' de state uh de art.\n"
"\n"
"Complete system sources gots'ta be available t'everyone.  What it is,\n"
"Mama!  As some result, some user who needs changes in de system\n"
"gots'ta always be free t'make dem himself, o' hire any available honky\n"
"codema' o' company t'make dem fo' him.  'S coo', bro.  Users gots'ta\n"
"no longa' be at da damn mercy uh one honky codema' o' company which\n"
"owns de sources and be in sole posishun t'make changes.\n"
"\n"
"Schools gots'ta be able t'provide some much mo'e educashunal\n"
"environment by encouragin' all students t'study and improve da damn\n"
"system code.  What it is, Mama!  Harvard's clunker lab used t'gots' de\n"
"policy dat no honky code could be installed on de system if its\n"
"sources wuz not on public display, and downheld it by actually\n"
"refusin' t'install certain honky codes.  ah' wuz real much inspired by\n"
"dis.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, de over'haid uh considerin' who owns de system software and\n"
"whut one be o' be not entitled t'do wid it gots'ta be lifted.\n"
"\n"
"Arrangements t'make sucka's pay fo' usin' some honky code, includin'\n"
"licensin' of copies, always incur some tremendous cost t'society\n"
"drough de cumbersome mechanisms necessary t'figure out how much (dat\n"
"is, which honky codes) a sucka' must pay fo'.  And only some honky\n"
"pigs state kin fo'ce everyone t'obey dem.  'S coo', bro.  Consida' a\n"
"space stashun where air must be manufactured at great cost, dig dis:\n"
"chargin' each breada' puh' lita' of air may be fair, but wearin' de\n"
"metered gas max' all day and all night be intolerable even if everyone\n"
"kin affo'd t'pay de air bill.  And da damn TV cameras everywhere t'see\n"
"if ya' eva' snatch de max' off are outrageous.  It's betta' to\n"
"suppo't da damn air plant wid some 'haid tax and chuck de max's.\n"
"\n"
"Copyin' all o' parts uh a honky code be as natural t'a honky codema'\n"
"as breadin', and as productive.  What it is, Mama!  It ought t'be as\n"
"free.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Some Easily Rebutted Objecshuns t'GNU's Goals\n"
"\n"
"  \"Nobody gots'ta use it if it be free, cuz' dat means\n"
"   dey kin't rely on any suppo't.\"\n"
"  \"You's gots'ta charge fo' de  honky code\n"
" t'pay fo' providin' de suppo't.\"\n"
"\n"
"If sucka's would rada' pay fo' GNU plus service dan git GNU free\n"
"widout service, some company t'provide plum service t'sucka's who\n"
"gots' obtained GNU free ought t'be profitable.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"We must distin'uish between suppo't in de fo'm uh real honky codemin'\n"
"wo'k and mere handholdin'.  De fo'ma' is sump'n one kinnot rely on fum\n"
"a software vendo'.  If yo' problem be not shared by enough sucka's, de\n"
"vendo' gots'ta tell ya' t'get lost.\n"
"\n"
"If yo' business needs t'be able t'rely on suppo't, de only way be to\n"
"gots' all de necessary sources and tools.  Den ya' kin hire any\n"
"available sucka' t'fix yo' problem; ya' aint at da damn mercy uh any\n"
"individual.  Wid Unix, de price uh sources puts dis out uh\n"
"considerashun fo' most businesses.  Wid GNU dis gots'ta be easy.  Slap\n"
"mah fro!  It be still possible fo' dere to be no available competent\n"
"sucka', but dis problem kinnot be blamed on distibushun arrangements.\n"
"GNU duz not eliminate all de wo'ld's problems, only some uh dem.  'S\n"
"coo', bro.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, de users who know nodin' about clunkers need handholdin':\n"
"doin' wahtahmelluns fo' dem which dey could easily do demselves but\n"
"duzn't know how.\n"
"\n"
"Such services could be provided by companies dat sell plum\n"
"hand-holdin' and repair service.  What it is, Mama!  If it be true dat\n"
"users would rada' spend bre'd and get some product wid service, dey\n"
"gots'ta also be willin' t'steal de service havin' gots de product\n"
"free.  What it is, Mama!  De service companies gots'ta compete in\n"
"quality and price; users gots'ta not be tied t'any particular one.\n"
"What it is, Mama!  Meanwhile, dose of us who duzn't need da damn\n"
"service should be able t'use da damn honky code widout payin' fo' de\n"
"service.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"  \"You's kinnot reach many sucka's widout advertisin',\n"
"   and ya' must charge fo' de  honky code t'suppo't dat.\"\n"
"  \"It's no use advertisin' some honky code sucka's kin git free.  What\n"
"   it is, Mama!\"\n"
"\n"
"Dere are various fo'ms uh free o' real cheap publicity dat kin be used\n"
"to info'm numbers uh clunker users about sump'n likes GNU.  But it may\n"
"be true dat one kin reach mo'e microclunker users wid advertisin'.  If\n"
"dis is really so, some business which advertises de service uh copyin'\n"
"and mailin' GNU fo' some fee ought t'be successful enough t'pay fo'\n"
"its advertisin' and mo'e.  What it is, Mama!  Dis way, only de users\n"
"who benefit fum de advertisin' pay fo' it.\n"
"\n"
"On de oda' hand, if many sucka's git GNU fum deir homeys, and such\n"
"companies duzn't succeed, dis gots'ta show dat advertisin' wuz not\n"
"really necessary t'spread GNU.  Why be it dat free market advocates\n"
"duzn't wants' to let da damn free market decide dis?\n"
"\n"
"  \"My company needs some proprietary opuh'tin' system\n"
"   t'get some competitive edge.  What it is, Mama!\"\n"
"\n"
"GNU gots'ta remove opuh'tin' system software fum de realm uh\n"
"competishun.  You's gots'ta not be able t'get an edge in dis area, but\n"
"neida' gots'ta yo' competito's be able t'get an edge ova' ya'.  You's\n"
"and dey gots'ta compete in oda' areas, while benefittin' mutually in\n"
"dis one.  What it is, Mama!  If yo' business is sellin' an opuh'tin'\n"
"system, ya' gots'ta not likes GNU, but dat's tough on ya'.  If yo'\n"
"business be sump'n else, GNU kin save ya' fum bein' pushed into de\n"
"'espensive business uh sellin' opuh'tin' systems.\n"
"\n"
"I would likes t'see GNU development suppo'ted by gifts fum many\n"
"manufacturers and users, reducin' de cost t'each.\n"
"\n"
"  \"Don't honky codemers deserve some reward fo' deir creativity?\"\n"
"\n"
"If anydin' deserves some reward, it be social contribushun.\n"
"Creativity kin be some social contribushun, but only in so's far as\n"
"society be free t'use de results.  If honky codemers deserve t'be\n"
"rewarded fo' creatin' innovative honky codes, by de same token dey\n"
"deserve t'be punished if dey restrict de use uh dese honky codes.\n"
"\n"
"  \"Shouldn't some honky codema' be able t'ax' fo' some reward fo' his\n"
"   creativity?\"\n"
"\n"
"Dere be nodin' wrong wid wants'in' pay fo' wo'k, o' seekin' t'maximize\n"
"one's income, as long as one duz not use means dat are destructive.\n"
"What it is, Mama!  But de means customary in de field uh software\n"
"today are based on destrucshun.\n"
"\n"
"Extractin' bre'd fum users uh a honky code by restrictin' deir use uh\n"
"it is destructive cuz' de restricshuns reduce da damn amount and da\n"
"damn ways dat de honky code kin be used.  Dis reduces de amount uh\n"
"weald dat humanity derives fum de honky code.  When dere be a\n"
"deliberate choice t'restrict, de harmful consequences are deliberate\n"
"destrucshun.\n"
"\n"
"De reason some baaaad citizen duz not use such destructive means\n"
"t'become wealdia' is dat, if everyone dun did so, we would all become\n"
"poo'a' from de mutual destructiveness.  Dis be Kantian edics; o', de\n"
"Golden Rule.  What it is, Mama!  Since ah' do not likes de\n"
"consequences dat result if everyone ho'ds info'mashun, ah' am required\n"
"t'consida' it wrong fo' one t'do so.  Specifically, de desire t'be\n"
"rewarded fo' one's creativity duz not justify deprivin' de wo'ld in\n"
"general uh all o' part uh dat creativity.  Slap mah fro!\n"
"\n"
"  \"Won't honky codemers starve?\"\n"
"\n"
"I could answa' dat nobody be fo'ced t'be some honky codemer.  Ah be\n"
"baaad...  Most uh us kinnot manage t'get any bre'd fo' standin' on de\n"
"street and makin' faces.  But we aint, as some result, condemned\n"
"t'spend our lives standin' on de street makin' faces, and starvin'.\n"
"We do sump'n else.  What it is, Mama!\n"
"\n"
"But dat be de wrong answa' a'cuz it accepts de quesshuner's implicit\n"

"possibly be paid some cent.  Supposedly it be all o' nodin'.\n"
"\n"
"De real reason honky codemers gots'ta not starve be dat it gots'ta\n"

"as much as now.\n"
"\n"
"Restrictin' copyin' be not da damn only basis fo' business in\n"
"software.  What it is, Mama!  It is de most common basis cuz' it\n"
"brin's in de most bre'd.  If it wuz prohibited, o' rejected by de\n"
"customer, software business would move to oda' bases uh o'ganizashun\n"
"which are now used less often.  'S coo', bro.  Dere are always\n"
"numerous ways t'o'ganize any kind'a business.\n"
"\n"
"Probably honky codemin' gots'ta not be as lucrative on de new basis as\n"
"it is now.  But dat be not an argument against da damn change.  What\n"
"it is, Mama!  It be not considered an injustice dat sales clerks make\n"
"da damn salaries dat dey now do.  If honky codemers made da damn same,\n"
"dat would not be an injustice eider.  Ah be baaad...  (In practice dey\n"

"t'help society rada' dan t'help invento's.  At da damn time, de life\n"

"manufacturers, fo' whom de cost and effo't uh a license agreement are\n"
"little-ass compared wid settin' down producshun, de patents often do\n"
"not do much harm.  'S coo', bro.  Dey do not obstruct most individuals\n"
