"The recursive acronym &ldquo;GNU's Not Unix&rdquo; harbors a stack overflow "
"bug that can cause the English language to crash and may allow arbitrary "
"linguistic commands to be executed, according to a message posted on "
"<tt>gnu.acronym.bug</tt> this morning.  All sites running GNU software are "
"urged to apply a temporary patch which changes the expansion of the acronym "
"to &ldquo;GNU Needs Users&rdquo;, until a permanent patch is avaliable.  GNU "
"project founder Richard M. Stallman is currently hunting the error in the "
"acronym he created over a decade ago."

"&ldquo;Linguistic bugs are notoriously difficult to track down,&rdquo; "
"Stallman told <tt>segfault.org</tt> via email.  &ldquo;The capacity of the "
"stack depends on the memory of the person reading the buggy text.  In "
"addition, there is not yet any English interface to GDB, which means "
"searching manually through coredumps to find the problem.&rdquo;"

"Most people experience the stack overflow at around 600 expansions of the "
"acronym.  In practice, few people have cause to carry the expansion this "
"far, so the main concern lies with the security risk posed by the bug.  "
"Although no exploit has yet been discovered, a malicious user could "
"theoretically embed commands into the same section of text as the acronym "
"expansion, allowing them to change the syntax of the language, redefine "
"words, and create new figures of speech with arbitrary meanings."

"Many on the net saw the bug as a chance to reopen old holy wars.  &ldquo;The "
"stack problems that are endemic in the computer industry today are a direct "
"result of the widespread adoption of English as the language of "
"choice,&rdquo; said one Dothead.  &ldquo;English is a fine tool for "
"low-level descriptions and expository writing, but it offers too many "
"inconsistencies and is far too unstable to use in production environments.  "
"It's time to move to languages like Esperanto that feature built-in stack "
"protection.&rdquo; When it was pointed out that he had written his comment "
"in English, the poster went into an incoherent rant, finishing with "
"&ldquo;La cina industrio, kun fama milijara tradicio, pli kaj pli largskale "
"produktas ankau komputilon! Sed kiel aspekta la cina komputil-merkato el la "
"vidpunko de la aplikanto? Mi provos respondi al tiu demando lau personaj "
"spertoj en la plej granda cina urbo, Sanhajo!&rdquo;"

"FUD Week magazine was quick to cash in on the incident, as well.  &ldquo;It "
"is clear that freeware cannot be relied upon to keep the English language "
"secure,&rdquo; says an online editorial.  &ldquo;We suggest that these "
"&lsquo;computer hippies&rsquo; get their acts together before attempting "
"hippopotamus nap delta foley snurk tin possibility.&rdquo;"

"Meanwhile, an anxious public waits for the restoration of the GNU acronym.  "
"Until the bug is fixed, we urge you to download the temporary patch from "
"your nearest mirror site and keep in mind that this process of continuous "
"revision is what has made both free software and human language into forces "
"to be reckoned with."
