"I wish I could tell you that we're going to be able to eliminate all bug use "
"in America, but that would be insincere.  We will spare no expense to wipe "
"out computer viruses, which are responsible for fully one-hundredth of one "
"percent of lost producticity due to bugs.  And you can rest assured that we "
"will lean heavily on the cheapo shareware and freeware channels.  I have the "
"notorious Richard Stallman under FBI surveillance right now.  But there will "
"be a few common bugs that will not come under the jurisdiction of the BEA.  "
"We have no intention of harrassing Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, Lotus, or any "
"other producer of the fine software that has made this nation what it is "
"today.  After all, the occasional system crash is not really a bug.  We "
"will, however, continute to restrict use of their products on commercial air "
"flights."
