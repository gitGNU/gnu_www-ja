"WASHINGTON, D.C.&mdash;The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular "
"Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are becoming "
"infected by a new virus that causes them to believe without question every "
"groundless story, legend, and dire warning that shows up in their Inbox or "
"on their browser.  The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently makes "
"people believe and forward copies of silly hoaxes relating to cookie "
"recipes, E-Mail viruses, taxes on modems, and get-rich-quick schemes "
"[perhaps conspiracy theories should be included here]."

"&ldquo;These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery "
"tickets based on fortune cookie numbers,&rdquo; a spokesman said.  "
"&ldquo;Most are otherwise normal people, who would laugh at the same stories "
"if told to them by a stranger on a street corner.&rdquo; However, once these "
"same people become infected with the Gullibility Virus, they believe "
"anything they read on the Internet."

"Another victim, now in remission, added, &ldquo;When I first heard about "
"&lsquo;Good Times,&rsquo; I just accepted it without question.  After all, "
"there were dozens of other recipients on the mail header, so I thought the "
"virus must be true.&rdquo; It was a long time, the victim said, before she "
"could stand up at a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting and state, &ldquo;My name is "
"Jane, and I've been hoaxed.&rdquo; Now, however, she is spreading the word.  "
"&ldquo;Challenge and check whatever you read,&rdquo; she says."

"T. C. is an example of someone recently infected.  He told one reporter, "
"&ldquo;I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos "
"makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo.&rdquo; When told "
"about the Gullibility Virus, T . C. said he would stop reading e-mail, so "
"that he would not become infected.  Anyone with symptoms like these is urged "
"to seek help immediately.  Experts recommend that at the first feelings of "
"gullibility, Internet users rush to their favorite search engine and look up "
"the item tempting them to thoughtless credence.  Most hoaxes, legends, and "
"tall tales have been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet community."
