<p>Hello,</p>

<p>One late rainy night I had an idea.  There is a hill on IL route 29
in Peoria IL, that people climb and write a small message across this
hill for everyone to view from a far.  What would be better than
spreading my two most favorite words across this hill.  So we set out
with a little over 200 garbage bags and nearly 400 nails.  12:30am and
rainy so you can figure that a hill of that size is going to be
slippery (lol) nearly falling down hill with every step we start
building each letter.  At around 2:30am we have finished and now the
sun will rise over a hill which spreads the words Free Software to
every person that passes by.  This is by far a vary small non-complex
hack but I beleve it is a hack in it self.  This is a tribute to Free
Software [and the GNU Project].</p>

<p>Happy Hacking</p>
