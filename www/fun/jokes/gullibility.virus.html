<h2>Gullibility Virus</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.&mdash;The Institute for the Investigation of
Irregular Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet users
are becoming infected by a new virus that causes them to believe
without question every groundless story, legend, and dire warning that
shows up in their Inbox or on their browser.  The Gullibility Virus,
as it is called, apparently makes people believe and forward copies of
silly hoaxes relating to cookie recipes, E-Mail viruses, taxes on
modems, and get-rich-quick schemes [perhaps conspiracy theories should
be included here].</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy
lottery tickets based on fortune cookie numbers,&rdquo; a spokesman
said.  &ldquo;Most are otherwise normal people, who would laugh at the
same stories if told to them by a stranger on a street corner.&rdquo;
However, once these same people become infected with the Gullibility
Virus, they believe anything they read on the Internet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all
gone,&rdquo; reported one weeping victim.  &ldquo;I believe every
warning message and sick child story my friends forward to me, even
though most of the messages are anonymous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another victim, now in remission, added, &ldquo;When I first heard
about &lsquo;Good Times,&rsquo; I just accepted it without question.
After all, there were dozens of other recipients on the mail header,
so I thought the virus must be true.&rdquo; It was a long time, the
victim said, before she could stand up at a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting
and state, &ldquo;My name is Jane, and I've been hoaxed.&rdquo; Now,
however, she is spreading the word.  &ldquo;Challenge and check
whatever you read,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the
virus, which include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the willingness to believe improbable stories without
thinking</li>
<li>the urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others</li>
<li>a lack of desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story
is true</li>
</ul>

<p>T. C. is an example of someone recently infected.  He told one
reporter, &ldquo;I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost
all shampoos makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using
shampoo.&rdquo; When told about the Gullibility Virus, T . C. said he
would stop reading e-mail, so that he would not become infected.
Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately.
Experts recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet
users rush to their favorite search engine and look up the item
tempting them to thoughtless credence.  Most hoaxes, legends, and tall
tales have been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet
community.</p>
