<h2>Know your System Administrator</h2>

<p>(A field guide)</p>

<p>There are four major species of Unix sysad:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <b>TECHNICAL THUG</b>.  Usually a systems programmer who has
been forced into system administration; writes scripts in a polyglot
of the Bourne shell, sed, C, awk, perl, and APL.</li>
<li>The <b>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST</b>.  Usually a retentive drone (or
rarely, a harridan ex-secretary) who has been forced into system
administration.</li>
<li>The <b>MANIAC</b>.  Usually an aging cracker who discovered that
neither the Mossad nor Cuba are willing to pay a living wage for
computer espionage.  Fell into system administration; occasionally
approaches major competitors with indesp schemes.</li>
<li>The <b>IDIOT</b>.  Usually a cretin, morphodite, or old COBOL
programmer selected to be the system administrator by a committee of
cretins, morphodites, and old COBOL programmers.</li>
</ol>

<h3>HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR</h3>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> Low disk space</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Writes a suite of scripts to monitor disk
usage, maintain a database of historic disk usage, predict future disk
usage via least squares regression analysis, identify users who are
more than a standard deviation over the mean, and send mail to the
offending parties.  Places script in cron.  Disk usage does not
change, since disk-hogs, by nature, either ignore script-generated
mail, or file it away in triplicate.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Puts disk usage policy in
<tt>motd</tt>. Uses disk quotas. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling
development work.  Locks accounts that go over quota.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i>
<pre>
# cd /home
# rm -rf `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`;
</pre></li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i>
<pre>
# cd /home
# cat `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{ printf "%s/*\n", $2}'` | compress
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> Excessive CPU usage</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Writes a suite of scripts to monitor
processes, maintain a database of CPU usage, identify processes more
than a standard deviation over the norm, and renice offending
processes.  Places script in cron.  Ends up renicing the production
database into oblivion, bringing operations to a grinding halt, much
to the delight of the xtrek freaks.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Puts CPU usage policy
in <tt>motd</tt>.  Uses CPU quotas.  Locks accounts that go over
quota.  Allows no exceptions, thus crippling development work, much to
the delight of the xtrek freaks.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i>
<pre>
# kill -9 `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9  | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`
</pre></li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i>
<pre>
# compress -f `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9  | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> New account creation</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Writes perl script that creates home
directory, copies in incomprehensible default environment, and places
entries in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>,
and <tt>/etc/group</tt>.  (By hand, NOT with passmgmt.)  Slaps on
setuid bit; tells a nearby secretary to handle new accounts.  Usually,
said secretary is still dithering over the difference between
&lsquo;enter&rsquo; and &lsquo;return&rsquo;; and so, no new accounts
are ever created.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Puts new account policy
in <tt>motd</tt>.  Since people without accounts cannot read
the <tt>motd</tt>, nobody ever fulfills the bureaucratic requirements;
and so, no new accounts are ever created.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i> &ldquo;If you're too stupid to break in and create
your own account, I don't want you on the system. We've got too many
goddamn sh*t-for-brains a**holes on this box anyway.&rdquo;</li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i>
<pre>
# cd /home; mkdir "Bob's home directory"
# echo "Bob Simon:gandalf:0:0::/dev/tty:compress -f" > /etc/passwd
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> Root disk fails</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Repairs drive.  Usually is able to repair
filesystem from boot monitor.  Failing that, front-panel toggles
microkernel in and starts script on neighboring machine to load binary
boot code into broken machine, reformat and reinstall OS.  Lets it run
over the weekend while he goes mountain climbing.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Begins investigation to determine
who broke the drive.  Refuses to fix system until culprit is
identified and charged for the equipment.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC, LARGE SYSTEM:</i> Rips drive from system, uses
sledgehammer to smash same to flinders.  Calls manufacturer, threatens
pets.  Abuses field engineer while they put in a new drive and
reinstall the OS.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC, SMALL SYSTEM:</i> Rips drive from system, uses
ball-peen hammer to smash same to flinders.  Calls Requisitions,
threatens pets.  Abuses bystanders while putting in new drive and
reinstalling OS.</li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i> Doesn't notice anything wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> Poor network response</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Writes scripts to monitor network, then
rewires entire machine room, improving response time by 2%.  Shrugs
shoulders, says, &ldquo;I've done all I can do,&rdquo; and goes
mountain climbing.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Puts network usage policy in
<tt>motd</tt>.  Calls up Berkeley and AT&amp;T, badgers whoever
answers for network quotas.  Tries to get xtrek freaks fired.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i> Every two hours, pulls ethernet cable from wall and
waits for connections to time out.</li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i>
<pre>
# compress -f /dev/en0
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> User questions</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Hacks the code of
emacs' <code>doctor-mode</code> to answer new users questions.
Doesn't bother to tell people how to start the new
&ldquo;guru-mode&rdquo;, or for that matter, emacs.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Puts user support policy in
<tt>motd</tt>.  Maintains queue of questions.  Answers them when he
gets a chance, often within two weeks of receipt of the proper
form.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i> Screams at users until they go away.  Sometimes
barters knowledge for powerful drink and/or sycophantic
adulation.</li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i> Answers all questions to best of his knowledge until
the user realizes few Unix systems support punched cards or JCL.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> Stupid user questions</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Answers question in hex, binary, postfix,
and/or French until user gives up and goes away.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Locks user's account until user can
present documentation demonstrating their qualification to use the
machine.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i>
<pre>
# cat > > ~luser/.cshrc
alias vi 'rm \!*;unalias vi;grep -v BoZo ~/.cshrc > ~/.z; mv -f ~/.z ~/.cshrc'
^D
</pre></li>

<li><i>IDIOT:</i> Answers all questions to best of his knowledge.
Recruits user to system administration team.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>SITUATION:</b> Process accounting management</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>TECHNICAL THUG:</i> Ignores packaged accounting software;
trusts scripts to sniff out any problems &amp; compute charges.</li>

<li><i>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</i> Devotes 75% of disk space to
accounting records owned by root and <tt>chmod</tt>'ed 000.</li>

<li><i>MANIAC:</i> Laughs fool head off at very mention of

<li><i>MANIAC:</i> Writes script that kills all the daemons, clears
all the print queues, and maybe restarts the daemons.  Runs it once a
hour from cron.</li>
