<h2>How many GNU/Linux users are needed to change a light bulb?</h2>

<pre>
1 to post a thread in a mailing list telling the bulb has burnt.
1 to suggest to try to turn the lamp on through command lines.
1 to complain that the user broke the thread.
1 to ask what new bulb will he install.
1 to advice that we shouldn't use the word burn for meaning a broken
lightbulb, because it would mean that the bulb was set on fire and that it
would be right to say that the bulb broke due to an excess of electrical
current.
25 to suggest to install all the kinds of existing and imaginable
lightbulbs.
5 who say that the burnt bulb is an upstream issue that doesn't belong to
the distro. There's an open bug on the bulb's developer mail list.
1 noob to suggest to install a Microsoft lightbulb.
250 to flood the noob's mail address.
300 to say that a Microsoft lightbulb would turn blue and that you'd had to
reboot continuously to get back to normal.
1 former GNU/Linux user who still frequents the forum, to suggest to install an
Apple iBulb, which has a fresh and innovating design and it costs $250.
20 to say that iBulbs aren't free, and that they have less functions than a
20 times cheaper standard lightbulb.
15 to suggest to install a national lightbulb.
30 to say that national lightbulbs are crippled remasters of foreign
lightbulbs and that they don't bring anything new.
23 to argue if it must be a white or a transparent bulb.
1 to remind everyone that the right name is GNU/Lightbulb.
1 to say that lightbulbs are a Winbugs users thing and that real GNU/Linux
users aren't afraid of the dark.
1 to announce finally which will be the model of the installed bulb.
217 to discard the chosen model and suggest another.
6 to complain that the chosen lightbulb has propietary elements, and that
another should be used.
20 to say that a 100% free bulb, isn't compatible with the lamp switch.
The same previous 6, to suggest to change the switch for a compatible one.
1 to yell out: “STOP ARGUING AND CHANGE THAT LIGHTBULB FOR GOD'S SAKE!”
350 to ask the previous user what God is he talking about, and that if he
has scientific proofs of His existence.
1 to explain how electricity works and why a light bulb is inefficient.
1 to say that we can't trust in corporation-made bulbs and that we should
trust in community-made bulbs.
1 to post a link to an ODF file explaining how to build a lightbulb from
scratch.
14 to complain about the format of the previous file and asking to send it
in txt or LaTeX.
5 to say that they didn't like the taken decission and that they'll fork
the house's electric installation and install a better lamp.
1 to post a series of commands to put to change the lightbulb.
1 to comment that he executed the commands and had an error message.
1 to advice that the commands must be executed as root

And finally:
The father of the first user, who while everyone was discussing, went
to the shop and bought the cheapest lightbulb.
