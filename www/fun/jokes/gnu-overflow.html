<h2>GNU-Overflow</h2>

<p>The recursive acronym &ldquo;GNU's Not Unix&rdquo; harbors a stack
overflow bug that can cause the English language to crash and may
allow arbitrary linguistic commands to be executed, according to a
message posted on <tt>gnu.acronym.bug</tt> this morning.  All sites
running GNU software are urged to apply a temporary patch which
changes the expansion of the acronym to &ldquo;GNU Needs Users&rdquo;,
until a permanent patch is avaliable.  GNU project founder Richard
M. Stallman is currently hunting the error in the acronym he created
over a decade ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linguistic bugs are notoriously difficult to track
down,&rdquo; Stallman told <tt>segfault.org</tt> via email.
&ldquo;The capacity of the stack depends on the memory of the person
reading the buggy text.  In addition, there is not yet any English
interface to GDB, which means searching manually through coredumps to
find the problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most people experience the stack overflow at around 600 expansions
of the acronym.  In practice, few people have cause to carry the
expansion this far, so the main concern lies with the security risk
posed by the bug.  Although no exploit has yet been discovered, a
malicious user could theoretically embed commands into the same
section of text as the acronym expansion, allowing them to change the
syntax of the language, redefine words, and create new figures of
speech with arbitrary meanings.</p>

<p>Many on the net saw the bug as a chance to reopen old holy wars.
&ldquo;The stack problems that are endemic in the computer industry
today are a direct result of the widespread adoption of English as the
language of choice,&rdquo; said one Dothead.  &ldquo;English is a fine
tool for low-level descriptions and expository writing, but it offers
too many inconsistencies and is far too unstable to use in production
environments.  It's time to move to languages like Esperanto that
feature built-in stack protection.&rdquo; When it was pointed out that
he had written his comment in English, the poster went into an
incoherent rant, finishing with &ldquo;La cina industrio, kun fama
milijara tradicio, pli kaj pli largskale produktas ankau komputilon!
Sed kiel aspekta la cina komputil-merkato el la vidpunko de la
aplikanto?  Mi provos respondi al tiu demando lau personaj spertoj en
la plej granda cina urbo, Sanhajo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>FUD Week magazine was quick to cash in on the incident, as well.
&ldquo;It is clear that freeware cannot be relied upon to keep the
English language secure,&rdquo; says an online editorial.  &ldquo;We
suggest that these &lsquo;computer hippies&rsquo; get their acts
together before attempting hippopotamus nap delta foley snurk tin
possibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an anxious public waits for the restoration of the GNU
acronym.  Until the bug is fixed, we urge you to download the
temporary patch from your nearest mirror site and keep in mind that
this process of continuous revision is what has made both free
software and human language into forces to be reckoned with.</p>
