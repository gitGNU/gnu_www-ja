<h2>Happiness is a bash prompt</h2>

<!-- The first verse may be interpreted as some reasons why to use
Vim. "Walk this way", in the first line, could be "use Vim", for
example. Also, the "voice from deep inside" could be one's interior
consciousness calling the use of a good editor such as Vim. "The
passage out of the dark" could be a way to start using Vim, or to
solve a problem when using it (e.g., when you can't remember the
letter for a command).- The refrain can be easily understood as a
request for some light on the use of Vim.- In the third verse, we also
have lucky coincidences, because "Seek the roses along the way" can
mean something like "look for useful and beautiful tools" and "Just
beware of the thorns" "It may not be so easy in the begining".  -->

<h3>Happiness is a bash prompt &mdash; Based on the Beatles' song
&ldquo;Happiness is a Warm Gun&rdquo;</h3>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>It's not a prompt that misses much<br />
Do do do do do do- oh yea!<br />
It's well acquainted with the touch that makes a good shell<br />
Like a butler on the terminal</p>

<p>The process in the list that forks all the time<br />
Spawns another, forks again<br />
Writing to the disk I don't know what<br />
Working overtime<br />
A soap impression of a virus on a Unix box<br />
The regex gets him every time</p>

<p>I need a fix 'cause I'm leaking RAM<br />
Swapping out my bytes to the disk<br />
I need a fix 'cause I'm leaking RAM<br />
X server's using up my RAM<br />
X server's using up my RAM<br />
X server's using up my RAM<br />
X server's using up my RAM</p>

<p>Happiness is a bash prompt<br />
Happiness is a bash prompt, mama<br />
When I ssh into your domain<br />
And I feel my finger on the return key<br />
I know nobody can do me no harm<br />
Because happiness is a bash prompt, mama<br />
Happiness is a bash prompt<br />
-Yes it is.<br />
Happiness is a prompt, yes it is&hellip;<br />
Bash!<br />
Well don't ya know that happiness is a bash prompt, mama?</p>
