<h2>If the Beatles were hackers&hellip;</h2>

<h3>Eleanor Rigby (with apologies to the Beatles)</h3>
<div class="lyrics">
<p>Eleanor Rigby<br />
Sits at the keyboard and waits for a line on the screen<br />
Lives in a dream<br />
Waits for a signal<br />
Writing some code that will make the machine do some more<br />
Who is it for?</p>

<p>All these lonely users, where do they all come from<br />
All these lonely users, where do they all belong</p>

<p>Hacker Mackenzy<br />
Writing the code for a program that no one will run<br />
Its nearly done.<br />
Look at him working.<br />
Fixing the bugs late at night when there's nobody there<br />
nobody cares.</p>

<p>All these lonely users, where do they all come from<br />
All these lonely users, where do they all belong<br />
Ahhhh&hellip; look at all those lonely users&hellip;<br />
Ahhhh&hellip; look at all those lonely users&hellip;</p>

<h3>Always a hacker (with apologies to Billy Joel)</h3>
<div class="lyrics">
<p>She can kill all your files<br />
She can freeze with a frown<br />
And a wave of her hand bring your whole system down<br />
And she works on her code until twelve after three<br />
She lives like a bat but she's always a hacker to me.</p>
</div>

<h3>Unknown morbid source</h3>
<div class="lyrics">
<p>He died at the console of hunger and thirst<br />
Next day he was buried<br />
Face down, nine edge first.</p>
