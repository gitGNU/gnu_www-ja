P.S.:  A bored acquaintance of mine ran The GNU Manifesto through
 doctor.  Highlights:

> You have your mind on unixs, it seems.

> What makes you believe a shell command interpreter is nearly
> completed?

> Do you really think you might want to supply eventually
> everything?

> Tell me about your mit.

> When did you first know that you must write gnu?

> Are you sure gnu will be compatible with unix?
