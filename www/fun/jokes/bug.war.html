<h2>War against bugs!</h2>

<p>From <cite>Doctor Dobb's Journal</cite>, 2/90, p. 158, &ldquo;The
War on Bugs&rdquo; (humor):</p>

<blockquote><p>I wish I could tell you that we're going to be able to
eliminate all bug use in America, but that would be insincere.  We
will spare no expense to wipe out computer viruses, which are
responsible for fully one-hundredth of one percent of lost
producticity due to bugs.  And you can rest assured that we will lean
heavily on the cheapo shareware and freeware channels.  I have the
notorious Richard Stallman under FBI surveillance right now.  But
there will be a few common bugs that will not come under the
jurisdiction of the BEA.  We have no intention of harrassing
Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, Lotus, or any other producer of the fine
software that has made this nation what it is today.  After all, the
occasional system crash is not really a bug.  We will, however,
continute to restrict use of their products on commercial air
flights.</p>
