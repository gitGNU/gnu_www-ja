<h2>THE GINGRINCH THAT STOLE CONGRESS</h2>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>THE GINGRINCH THAT STOLE CONGRESS</p>
<p>(With apologies to Dr. Seuss)</p>

<p>Every Rep down in Congress liked Clinton somewhat,<br />
Except for the Gingrinch, who simply did NOT!<br />
He hated Bill Clinton! He hated his wife!<br />
He vowed to torment them the rest of his life!</p>

<p>The Ging hated anyone left of the Huns,<br />
He hated the wusses who didn't like guns.<br />
He hated the teachers who wouldn't lead prayers,<br />
He hated the people who'd tax millionaires!<br />
He hated &ldquo;McGoverniks&rdquo; whining 'bout rights,<br />
Like equal protection for gays and nonwhites.</p>

<p>He hated the folks who said &ldquo;Nicotine kills&rdquo;<br />
And vowed he would pass more pro-nicotine bills.<br />
He hated the folks who said &ldquo;Women need choice&rdquo;<br />
And vowed to give middle-aged males more voice.<br />
But he hated the people on welfare much more;<br />
He hated the way they were POOR POOR POOR POOR!</p>

<p>He hated the way they had no jobs at all,<br />
This struck him as heaploads of GALL GALL GALL GALL!<br />
They also lacked training and day care.  So what?<br />
The Gingrinch announced he'd come up with a plot:<br />
&ldquo;Get off of Welfare! Get off today!<br />
Or we will take all of your children AWAY!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, no one knew what made the Ging such a meanie:<br />
It could be because he had a small weenie.<br />
It could be because he had Donahue hair,<br />
Or maybe because not much lurked under there.<br />
But probably what most explained the man's life<br />
Was that he abandoned his children and wife.</p>

<p>Yes, 'way down in Georgia, his wife lay near dead<br />
Sickened with cancer, in a hospital bed.<br />
He crept in to see her (they let him, of course)<br />
And whispered, quite sweetly, &ldquo;I want a divorce!&rdquo;<br />
He whipped out his pencil with something like zeal<br />
And got down to work on his alimony deal.<br />
And while she was whimp'ring he said, &ldquo;By the way,<br />
I'm leaving for somebody younger &mdash; hooray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Gingrinch's heart shrank two sizes that night.<br />
And that could be what makes him so Christian Right.<br />
Now, the night before Congress the Ging hatched his plans:<br />
From now on he'd speak for, quote, &ldquo;Normal Americans.&rdquo;<br />
Tax-slashers!  That's what those &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; folks love!<br />
He'd take to the skies and dismantle the gov!</p>

<p>He jumped out of bed and he summoned his pet:<br />
A doberman pinscher who once killed a vet.<br />
George was his name (as in Wallace, not Bush);<br />
&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; said the Gingrinch, &ldquo;We're gonna whip tush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They flew to a soup kitchen, filled with sad &ldquo;bums,&rdquo;<br />
Snatched up the kettle and stole all the crumbs.<br />
They flew to a basketball game late at night<br />
And shooed the kids out, to the dealers' delight.</p>

<p>They unplugged mass transit and cried &ldquo;Buy a car!&rdquo;<br />
Then chopped down a forest and chomped a cigar.<br />
What bliss!  What fun!  What downright glee!<br />
What joy!  What yuks!  What great TV!</p>

<p>The next day the Gingrinch sat high above view<br />
And looked down on Congress (as many folks do).<br />
He wanted to relish the joy and the cheer<br />
Of folks waking up to their first tax-free year.</p>

<p>He waited and waited and waited some more;<br />
He waited to hear them cry &ldquo;Newt!  Take the floor!&rdquo;<br />
He waited for kudos and champagne free-flowing,<br />
He waited for trumpets on high to start blowing.<br />
But instead of rejoicing and hoopla, etcet,<br />
He heard a strange rumble that made his palms sweat.</p>

<p>The people weren't happy, not happy at all!<br />
They ringed 'round the Statehouse!  They filled up the hall!<br />
They groused and they grumbled and cried, &ldquo;We're real mad!<br />
We want all those costly old programs we had!<br />
Give back our givebacks!  Give back our pork!<br />
Give back the stuff you walked off with, you dork!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Gingrinch sat simply quite stunned at the sight<br />
Of Normal Americans, not left and not right.</p>

<p>They wanted clean air and they wanted green trees,<br />
They wanted full coverage for medical fees,<br />
They wanted nice schools and streets safe to play,<br />
They wanted it all &mdash; they just didn't want to pay!</p>

<p>And when the truth hit him, the Ging grinned a grin,<br />
He laughed and he laughed till the tears ran down his chin.<br />
The Clintons climbed up to the Dome, laughing too.<br />
&ldquo;Hee hee hee,&rdquo; Bill and Hill laughed, &ldquo;Hoo hoo
hoo!&rdquo;<br />
They laughed with the cheer that comes from within,<br />
They laughed with the knowledge: You just cannot win.</p>

<p>The Gingrinch and Clintons now shared the same plight<br />
Whatever they'd do, they could not do it right.<br />
&ldquo;Folks hate you,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;once you land in D.C.<br />
But I've got a plan: Let us bond, you and me.<br />
We'll work as a team, yes! That's my advice!<br />
We'll listen and nod and make NICE NICE NICE!&rdquo;<br />
The Prez put his hand out, they hugged on the ledge&hellip;</p>

<p>And then that old Gingrinch pushed Bill off the edge.</p>
