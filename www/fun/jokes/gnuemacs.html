<h3>April Fool Mail - emacs rewrite</h3>

<p><i>The following is an April fool mail received from RMS.  It
wasn't actually sent by him, but he found it funny.</i></p>

<blockquote><pre>

Subject: emacs rewrite
</pre>

<p>After more than 30 years I think it's time to rewrite emacs from
scratch.</p>

<p>I would be happy to hear your suggestions about the best language
to use.</p>

<p>At the moment I think that Perl would be the best fit, because of
its acronym:</p>

<p>Perfect emacs rewriting language.</p>
