<h2>GNU Emacs Song</h2>

<h3>Welcome to GNU Emacs</h3>

<blockquote><p>(Hacked up by Jamie Mason to the tune 
&ldquo;Welcome to the Jungle&rdquo; by Guns 'n'
Roses)</p></blockquote>

<p>
&lt;Heavy guitar intro, &ldquo;Oh my GOD!&rdquo; spoken in the
background...&gt;
</p>

<pre>
Welcome to GNU Emacs
We've got fun'n'games
We got everything you want
If you just know the names
We are people that define
Whatever you may need.
If you've got the mem'ry, honey
We got your disease
</pre>

<pre>
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Watch it bring your system to its knees.
I, I wanna fill yer disk
</pre>

<pre>
Welcome to GNU Emacs
We malloc() K by K
If you want it you're gonna thrash
But it's the price you pay
And it's a very fast machine
With sixty megs of core
It used to handle lotsa users
But can't do it anymore
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Won't you feed my... my... my... my... mem'ry need?
I wanna hear you thrash!
</pre>

<pre>
Welcome to GNU Emacs
It gets bigger ev'ry day
You learn to fill all the disk packs
On the system where we play
And if you've got some swap that we can see
We'll brk() it eventually
You can allocate anything you want
But you'd better not take it from me
</pre>

<pre>
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Watch it bring your system to its knees
I'm gonna fill yer disk
</pre>

<pre>
When you're up
You never ever wanna shut down, shutdown, shutdown, SHUTDOWN!
YEAH!
</pre>

<pre>
You know where you are?
You in GNU Emacs, baby.
Yer system's gonna DIE!
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Watch it bring your system to its knees
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Won't you feed my... my... my... my... mem'ry need?
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Watch it bring your system to its knees
In GNU Emacs
Welcome to GNU Emacs
Watch it bring your system...
It's gonna bring it down!
HA!
</pre>
