The first verse may be interpreted as some reasons why to use Vim. "Walk
this way", in the first line, could be "use Vim", for example. Also, the
"voice from deep inside" could be one's interior consciousness calling the
use of a good editor such as Vim. "The passage out of the dark" could be a
way to start using Vim, or to solve a problem when using it (e.g., when
you can't remember the letter for a command).- The refrain can be easily understood as a request for some light on the
use of Vim.- In the third verse, we also have lucky coincidences, because "Seek the
roses along the way" can mean something like "look for useful and
beautiful tools" and "Just beware of the thorns" "It may not be so easy in
the begining".

<H4>Vim, send me an angel!</H4>
The wise man said just walk this way
To the dawn of the light
The wind will blow into your face
As the years pass you by
Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and your will find
The passage out of the dark

V-I-M
Will you send me an angel
V-I-M
In the land of the morning star

The wise man said just find your place
In the eye of the storm
Seek the roses along the way
Just beware of the thorns

V-I-M
Will you send me an angel
V-I-M
In the land of the morning star

The wise man said just raise your hand
And reach out for the spell
Find the door to the promised land
Just believe in yourself
Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and your will find
The way out of the dark

V-I-M
Will you send me an angel
V-I-M
In the land of the morning star
V-I-M
Will you send me an angel
V-I-M
In the land of the morning star
