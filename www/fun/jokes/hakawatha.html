<h2>HAKAWATHA</h2>

<blockquote>
<div class="lyrics">
<p>HAKAWATHA</p>

<p>with apologies to H.W. Longfellow</p>

<p>First, he sat and faced the console<br />
Faced the glowing, humming console<br />
Typed his login at the keyboard<br />
Typed his password (fourteen letters)<br />
Waited till the system answered<br />
Waited long and cursed its slowness<br />
(Oh, that irritating slowness &mdash;<br />
Like a mollusc with lumbago)<br />
Waited for what seemed like hours<br />
Till the operating system<br />
Printed out the latest whinings<br />
From the man called &ldquo;superuser&rdquo; &mdash;<br />
Moanings that some third year students<br />
Played adventure games at lunchtimes,<br />
Moanings the the Disc was nearly<br />
(VERY nearly) full to bursting,<br />
Growling that he wouldn't take it<br />
Screaming that he'd get his own back<br />
By deleting peoples' discfiles.</p>

<p>Next, came Hakawatha's &ldquo;fortune&rdquo;<br />
(Didn't find it very funny)<br />
Then from &ldquo;mailer&rdquo; took a letter<br />
From a fellow network hacker<br />
(Who had penetrated ARPA<br />
All the way to Greenham Common &mdash;<br />
Though his prowling through the filestore<br />
Hadn't pleases the US Airforce &mdash;<br />
So this friend, this network hacker,<br />
Had to flee to Argentina<br />
Where he works on simulations<br />
Simulations of their army's<br />
Capture of the Falkland Islands).</p>

<p>Finally, my Hakawatha<br />
Started to type in a program.<br />
First, he thought for many minutes<br />
What the Devil he should call it<br />
So that later he'd remember<br />
What it did and why he wrote it,<br />
Thought for many, many minutes,<br />
Thought too long, because the system<br />
timed him out for doing nothing<br />
Timed him out and warned him sternly<br />
(Like an irate bus inspector<br />
While you fumble for your ticket<br />
When you could have SWORN you'd put it<br />
Safely in an inside pocket).</p>

<p>So the wretched Hakawatha<br />
Had to start from the beginning<br />
Type the login and the password &mdash;<br />
Found the system even slower<br />
Even slower than the first time<br />
(Just as though some evil spirit<br />
Had reprogrammed all of Unix<br />
In the language LISP or OCCAM &mdash;<br />
Which among the cognoscenti<br />
Are not famed for running quickly<br />
Rather for their ponderous slowness<br />
Like a third year CS student<br />
Trying to make out a theorem<br />
Such as that of Church and Rosser).<br />
After many, many minutes<br />
After risking death from boredom<br />
On the screen, my Hakawatha<br />
Saw a message from the Network<br />
Saying there were no free consoles,<br />
Telling him to just forget it,<br />
Telling him to come back later<br />
(Say, two-thirty in the morning<br />
Preferably a Sunday morning,<br />
Sunday, in the long vacation).</p>

<p>But at this, my Hakawatha<br />
spoke in language full of fury:<br />
&ldquo;I would rather write in COBOL<br />
On a Sinclair ZX80!&rdquo;<br />
Thus, the Gods heard Hakawatha<br />
Heard the Thunder of his anger<br />
Heard him damn the &ldquo;superuser&rdquo;<br />
To a post in Social Science<br />
Heard him damn the Network to be<br />
Slowly boiled in caustic soda<br />
Heard him curse the sort of people<br />
Who use LISP instead of Ada<br />
(Ada is a complex language<br />
Copyright, Defence Department<br />
It has got a formal syntax<br />
Rather longer than the Bible<br />
But semantically there's nothing<br />
But informal chitter-chatter.<br />
Reader! Use it at your peril!)</p>

<p>And the Gods took pity on him<br />
(Though they quite deplored the language<br />
Quite deplored the filthy language<br />
Utilised by Hakawatha)<br />
Brought about a console failure<br />
Of some wimp in Economics<br />
Freed a line so he could use it<br />
Made his screen display a message:<br />
&ldquo;Sorry, we were only joking<br />
Please log in and type your password<br />
We'll be with you in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus assuaged did Hakawatha<br />
Type his login and his password<br />
Read again the Jeremiads<br />
Of the manic &ldquo;superuser&rdquo;<br />
Read his fortune (still not funny)<br />
And prepared to type his program.<br />
Still, alas, my Hakawatha<br />
had no notion what to call it<br />
What to call this wretched program<br />
So that he'd remember later<br />
What it did and why he wrote it<br />
But the dreaded timeout th=eatened<br />
So to save himself from bother<br />
He just called it &ldquo;program 7&rdquo;<br />
Not a name that had much meaning<br />
Signifying nearly nothing<br />
&mdash; Though it has the real advantage<br />
That it fits in with this metre)<br />
Meaning to <tt>mv</tt> it later<br />
When he'd though of something lYeditor he entered<br />
Hakawatha then typed quickly<br />
Very, very, VERY quickly<br />
Swifter than a third-year student<br />
Trying to avoid his tutor<br />
Swifter than a &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; &lsquo;reporter&rsquo;<br />
On the track of something smutty<br />
Like an eagle flew his fingers<br />
Only pausing several moments<br />
While he taxed his recollection<br />
For his algorithm's details<br />
These he knew but only vaguely<br />
(As the mists that on the sunrise<br />
Cloak the lofty mountian summit<br />
As the blur that s-nd-rs printers<br />
Make instead of underlining<br />
As the third year students' notio<br />n
Of the proof of Turing's Theorem)</p>

<p>These deliberations ended<br />
Hakawatha typed yet faster<br />
Missing quotes and semicolons<br />
Missing many closing brackets<br />
(Comments, these he left for later<br />
Till he understood his program<br />
Understood what he'd been doing)<br />
Confident that the compiler<br />
Would pick up the syntax errors<br />
Thus, the program grew like wildfire<br />
Like the spread of some contagious<br />
Malady, like AIDS or BASIC<br />
Or as miners ceased their striking<br />
In the reign of Arthur Scargill.</p>

<p>Hakawatha typed like fury<br />
Clatter, clatter went the keyboard<br />
Like a set of manic dentures<br />
So the morning, so the lunchtime,<br />
So the afternoon receded<br />
Like the superuser's hairline<br />
When beset by third year students<br />
All intent to learn his password<br />
Till at last the stars were twinkling<br />
Till at last the pubs were open<br />
Till Security, reminded<br />
Tapped upon his door and warned him<br />
&ldquo;Sorry, sir, but all late workers
Have to sign the sign-in book, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even then, my Hakawatha<br />
Hardly heard what he was saying<br />
Very red and glazed his eyes were<br />
Cramped and aching were his fingers<br />
Void and rumbling was his stomach<br />
Cold and sweaty was his forehead<br />
Warm and humming was the console<br />
Like a cow with indigestion<br />
Thanked Security and told him<br />
That he'd do it &ldquo;in a minute&rdquo;<br />
That he'd &ldquo;totally forgotten<br />
All that bureaucratic nonsense<br />
In the white-heat of creation&rdquo;<br />
Asked to warn him if the building<br />
Burnt down in the next few minutes<br />
Thanked him for his &ldquo;kind attention&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, ignoring him completely,<br />
Turned again and hit the keyboard<br />
With his swift and able fingers<br />
Till at last the night lay heavy<br />
Till at last the pubs were closing<br />
Till at last the job was finished.</p>

<p>Next my Hakawatha summoned<br />
The appropriate compiler<br />
Asking it to take his program<br />
And attempt its execution<br />
Listing any syntax errors &mdash;<br />
Should by any chance there be some &mdash;<br />
In a file that he called &ldquo;errors&rdquo;<br />
(Stunning was the inovation<br />
Vouchsafed by this choice of naming)<br />
Asked it please to run in background.</p>

<p>Swiftly grew the file named &ldquo;errors&rdquo;<br />
Till it seemed to grow much larger<br />
Than the file called &ldquo;program 7&rdquo;<br />
Larger was the file named &ldquo;errors&rdquo;<br />
Larger than the largest mountain<br />
Larger than the cost of Trident<br />
Larger than the monstrous ego<br />
Of that God whom men name D--kstr-<br />
Larger even than the software<br />
People call the Unix mailer<br />
(Though, perhaps, exaggeration,<br />
Or that licence named poetic<br />
Leads me to commit an error<br />
Since we know the Unix mailer<br />
To be bigger and more faulty<br />
Than the liner named Titanic)</p>

<p>Worried now grew Hakawatha<br />
Tride to kill the background process<br />
Tried to bring it to the foreground<br />
Tried to say to the compiler<br />
&ldquo;That'll do, guv, for the moment&rdquo;<br />
All unheedingly the process<br />
Gobbled bytes like no-one's business<br />
Till it seemed as though the system<br />
Would collapse from sheer exhaustion<br />
From the quantity of page swops<br />
Needed by this tireless process.</p>

<p>Desperate grew Hakawatha<br />
Vivid, yet again, his curses<br />
Purpled the attendant shadows.<br />
Thus the Gods heard Hakawatha<br />
Listened in to the bad language<br />
Thought that they had better stop it<br />
Firmly told the Unix system<br />
Firmly, to stop all its nonsense<br />
Firmly, to abort the process.</p>

<p>Now, this program had a pointer<br />
Pointing to a record union<br />
Pointing sometimes to a REAL<br />
Or an INTEGER or BOOLEAN<br />
Pointing sometimes to a pointer<br />
To ARRAY of FILE of RECORD<br />
Each of which in turn had pointers<br />
Each of which, in mad recursion,<br />
Pointed madly at each other<br />
(Like a crowd of Sunday tabloids<br />
Pointing the accusing finger<br />
At each other's lack of morals<br />
Like a crowd of left-wing students<br />
All accusing one another<br />
Of revisionistic leanings)</p>

<p>In this mess of pure confusion<br />
(with what seemed to Hakawatha<br />
At the time a stroke of genius<br />
But which now he couldn't clearly<br />
Understand why he had done it)<br />
He had placed a simple statement<br />
Placed a simple-looking statement<br />
Re-assigning the FIRST pointer<br />
To some other, and he couldn't<br />
QUITE remember where he'd put it,<br />
Felt that this might be the reason<br />
Why his program wasn't working<br />
Wasn't doing what he wanted.</p>

<p>This occasioned some frustration<br />
Caused the noble Hakawatha<br />
To commit profane expletives<br />
Caused him to cry out &ldquo;Debug her!&rdquo;<br />
(Or, I THINK that's what he shouted).<br />
&ldquo;There are easier methods, surely,<br />
Methods for the computation<br />
Computation of factorial!<br />
Stuff this for a game of soldiers!<br />
I am going to the staff club<br />
For a pint of Romfords' Glory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus departed Hakawatha.</p>
