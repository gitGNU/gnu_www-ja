<h2>Subject: errno(2) codes</h2>

<blockquote><p>
The following was sent to me by a friend who was working at HP during
the summer.  I am posting it here for the people who missed the USENIX
conference and who don't get the HP newsgroups.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the USENIX Association conference in Atlanta recently a contest
was held to invent the most humorous/bizarre/etc UN*X error message of
the errno(2) &lsquo;EERROR&rsquo; type.  This contest had been tried
at an earlier European Users Group meeting, where the winning entry
was:</p>

<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="15">
<tr><th>ENOTOBACCO</th>
<td>Read on an empty pipe</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You get the idea.  A partial [alphabetized] list of
&lsquo;top(?)&rsquo; entries from Atlanta [and from several readers of
hp.unix] follows; if your pun/wierdness tolerance is low, you may want
to abandon ship:</p>

<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="15">
<tr><th>EBEFOREI</th>
<td>Invalid syntax</td></tr>

<tr><th>ECHERNOBYL</th>
<td>Core dumped</td></tr>

<tr><th>ECRAY</th>
<td>Program exited before being run</td></tr>

<tr><th>EDINGDONG</th>
<td>The daemon is dead</td></tr>

<tr><th>EFLAT</th>
<td>System needs tuning</td></tr>

<tr><th>EGEEK</th>
<td>Program written by inept Frat member</td></tr>

<tr><th>EIEIO</th>
<td>Here-a-bug, there-a-bug, &hellip;</td></tr>

<tr><th>EIUD</th>
<td>Missing period</td></tr>

<tr><th>ELECTROLUX</th>
<td>Your code could stand to be cleaned up</td></tr>

<tr><th>EMILYPOST</th>
<td>Wrong fork</td></tr>

<tr><th>END.ARMS.CONTROL</th>
<td>Silo overflow</td></tr>

<tr><th>ENOHORSE</th>
<td>Mount failed</td></tr>

<tr><th>ENONSEQUETOR</th>
<td>C program not derived from main(){printf("Hello, world");}</td></tr>

<tr><th>EWATERGATE</th>
<td>Extended tape gap</td></tr>

<tr><th>EWOK</th>
<td>Aliens sighted</td></tr>

<tr><th>EWOK</th>
<td>Your code appears to have been stir-fried</td></tr>

<tr><th>EWOULDBNICE</th>
<td>The feature you want has not been implemented yet</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And finally, a sort-of &lsquo;period piece&rsquo;:</p>

<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="15">
<tr><th>EMR.ED</th>
<td>A host is a host,<br />
From coast to coast<br />
And nobody talks to a host that's close,<br />
Unless the host that isn't close<br />
Is busy, hung, or dead.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>I would also like this new signal to be supported:</p>

<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="15">
<tr><th>SIGNUKE</th>
<td>Nuclear event occurred (cannot be caught or ignored :-)</td></tr>
</table>
