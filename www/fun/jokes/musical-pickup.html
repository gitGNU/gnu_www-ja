        bar line (where he meets her)
        sax (what he wants)
        suite (what he says she is)
        sheet music (what she puts on the CD player in her room)
        sol-fa (what they lie down on)
        "Triad!" (he suggests tying her up with a major chord)
        "Duet!" (her answer)
        staff (what he pulls out next)
        score (what he does)
        no treble (what he's had)
        a trill (what he assumes she's had)
        a C note (what she hopes for)
        forte (what she's willing to accept)
        a tenor (what he ends up paying)
        "Bass!" (what she calls him)
