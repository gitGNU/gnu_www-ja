This song, it has no author
No place of origin;

And it never did begin;
This song can travel anywhere;
There's no place it don't belong . . .
'Cause nobody owns this song.

In major or minor keys.
All parts can be rearranged
In any ways you please.
Many things can be done to this,
And none of them are wrong,
'Cause nobody owns this song.

You can play it on the lute,
You can play it on the flute,
You can play it on the slide trombone.
You can play it on the harp,
You can play it flat or sharp,
You can play it on the saxophone.
You can play it real high or
You can play it real low,
You can play it real fast or
You can play it real slow,
You can play it real short or
You can play it real long,
'Cause nobody owns this song.
