<h2>The Last Bug</h2>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>&ldquo;But you're out of your mind,&rdquo;<br />
They said with a shrug.<br />
&ldquo;The customer's happy;<br />
What's one little bug?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he was determined.<br />
The others went home.<br />
He spread out the program,<br />
Deserted, alone.</p>

<p>The cleaning men came,<br />
The whole room was cluttered<br />
With memory-dumps, punch cards.<br />
&ldquo;I'm close,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>The mumbling got louder,<br />
Simple deduction,<br />
&ldquo;I've got it, it's right,<br />
Just change one instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It still wasn't perfect,<br />
As year followed year,<br />
And strangers would comment,<br />
&ldquo;Is that guy still here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He died at the console,<br />
Of hunger and thirst.<br />
Next day he was buried,<br />
Face down, nine-edge first.</p>

<p>And the last bug in sight,<br />
An ant passing by,<br />
Saluted his tombstone,<br />
And whispered, &ldquo;Nice try.&rdquo;</p>
