<h2>Hack For Freedom Song</h2>

<h3>Hack For Freedom based on Manowar &mdash; Fight for Freedom</h3>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>There's a sound heard across the AI lab<br />
It's heard across the world<br />
You'll only hear it if you share your software<br />
And one day hope to be free</p>

<p>To hear the sound of freedom many gave their nights<br />
They hacked for you and me<br />
Those memories will always live in silence<br />
And now it's our time to free Unix</p>

<p>[Chorus:]</p>
<p>Where the hackers play &mdash; I will soon be there<br />
If you want to &mdash; come along with me my friend<br />
Share the software and you'll be free<br />
From the Hurd to Emacs<br />
We'll hack for freedom again</p>

<p>Scream out loud for all the world to hear<br />
From MIT to the Savannah<br />
Let freedom ring and every hacker be king<br />
To live on GNU through the years</p>

<p>[Repeat chorus]</p>

<p>Now's the time we all must stand together<br />
So raise your keyboard show them we are strong<br />
Side by side the hacking goes on forever<br />
Marching to the battle with our code</p>

<p>[Repeat chorus to fade]</p>
