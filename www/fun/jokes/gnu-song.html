<div class="lyrics">
<p>The GNU Song</p>
<p>(to the tune of &ldquo;At The Drop of a Hat&rdquo;,<br />
by Michael Flanders and Donald Swann)</p>

<p>A year ago last Thursday, I was in a computer shop<br />
When I met a man who thought he knew the lot<br />
He was laying down the law about copyrights and licenses<br />
And the number of patents large companies have got<br />
So I asked him &ldquo;What's that creature's name?&rdquo; and he
answered &ldquo;That's Unix!&rdquo;<br />
And I'd have gone on thinking that was true<br />
If the animal in question hadn't put that chap to shame,<br />
And remarked&mdash;&ldquo;GNU's not Unix&mdash;I'm a GNU!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I'm a GNU&mdash;I'm a GNU<br />
The g-nicest work of g-nature in the zoo<br />
I'm a GNU&mdash;how do you do?<br />
You really oughtta g-know w-who's w-who<br />
I'm a GNU&mdash;spelt G - N - U<br />
I'm not closed source or cost a buck or two<br />
So let me introduce, I'm neither man nor moose<br />
Oh, g-no, g-no, g-no, I'm a GNU!</p>

<p>I had taken a job coding down at Rustington-on-sea<br />
Whence I travelled on to Aston-under-lyne<br />
On the second night I stayed there I was wakened from a dream<br />
Which I'll tell you all about some other time<br />
Among the thousand programs on the disk in my PC<br />
Installed and mounted was code I thought I knew<br />
BSD?  Unix?  Could it be a hearty beast?<br />
Then I seem to hear a voice&mdash;&ldquo;I'm a GNU!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I'm a GNU-a-g-nother GNU<br />
I know I could g-show my code to you<br />
I'm a GNU&mdash;how do you do?<br />
You really oughtta g-know w-who's w-who<br />
I'm a GNU&mdash;spelt G - N - U<br />
Steal my bison or my octave and I'll sue<br />
Nor am I in the least like that dreadful M$ beast<br />
Oh, g-no, g-no, g-no, I'm a GNU!<br />
G-no, g-no, g-no, I'm a GNU!<br />
G-no, g-no, g-no, I'm a GNU!</p>
