		functions that the user never needs and awkwardly
		performs the half-dozen he uses constantly.

		not bother with the full color manual.

Version 1.0:  Buggier than Maine in June;  eats data.

Version 1.1:  Eats data only occasionally; upgrade is free, to avoid litigation
		by disgruntled users of Version 1.0.

Version 2.0:  The version originally planned as the first release, except for
		a couple of data-eating bugs that just won't seem to go away;
		no free upgrades or the company would go bankrupt.

Version 3.0:  The revision in the works when the company goes bankrupt.

Videotex:  A moribund electronic service offering people the privelege of
		paying to read the weather on their television screens instead
		of having Willard Scott read it to them free while they
		brush their teeth.

Workstation:  A computer or terminal slavishly linked to a mainframe that does
		not offer game programs.
