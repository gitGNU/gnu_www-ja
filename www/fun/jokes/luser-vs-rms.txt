This is great.  There are GNU users for whom the name 'rms' is completely
unknown.

This guy sent in a request for a GUI GDB to the configure mailing list.  I
sent him an answer, and I got this back from him....

   Thanx for the info.  By the way I received a rather unfriendly response to
   the query from a "rms, Richard Stallman" at your site.  It sounded like
   a philistine user, and I'm sorry if my query went to the wrong site, but
   you might try to have controlled response privileges for such users.
