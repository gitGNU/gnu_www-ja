>From Doctor Dobb's Journal, 2/90, p. 158,"The War on Bugs" (humor)

  I wish I could tell you that we're going to be able to eliminate all
bug use in America, but that would be insincere.  We will spare no
expense to wipe out computer viruses, which are responsible for fully
one-hundredth of one percent of lost producticity due to bugs.  And you
can rest assured that we will lean heavily on the cheapo shareware and
freeware channels.  I have the notorious Richard Stallman under FBI
surveillance right now.  But there will be a few common bugs that will
not come under the jurisdiction of the BEA.  We have no intention of
harrassing Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, Lotus, or any other producer of the
fine software that has made this nation what it is today.  After all,
the occasional system crash is not really a bug.  We will, however,
continute to restrict use of their products on commercial air flights.
