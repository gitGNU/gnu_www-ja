    What is the policy for putting this sort of non-Free Software
    related content up anyway?
  
The humor page is a special case; that general question is not
the right question here.
  
Our policy for the humor page should be that we included something if
all of these are true:
  
1. We think it is funny.
2. It has no copyright problems.
3. It is not libelous.
4. It won't offend most ordinary hackers more than
   is reasonable in humor.

The humor does not have to be computer-related.

    We knew things like this would happen. What do we do now? Some
    people may find "shit happens" offensive too.

It is written, "Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke."
We will not be intimidated by a few stiff-necks.

I occasionally got complaints on etc/sex.6 from the Emacs
distribution.  I responded to one such complaint by adding celibacy.1
and lisp/play/meese.el.
