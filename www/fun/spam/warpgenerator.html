<h2>Dimensional Warp Generator Needed</h2>

Hello,

I'm a time traveler stuck here in 2003.

Upon arriving here my dimensional warp generator stopped working. I truste=
d a company here by the name of LLC Lasers to repair my Generation 3 52 43=
50A watch unit, and they fled on me.

Since nobody in this timeline seems to be able to deliver what I need (saf=
ely here to me), I will have to build a simple time travel circuit to get =
where I need myself. While it might be hard to find parts in this time to =
build anything decent, I need easy to follow schematics from the future to=
 build one which is safe and accurate that will not disrupt the time space=
 continuum with both forward and backward capability accounting for tempor=
al location settings (X, Y, Z, n), which can be built out of (readily avai=
lable) parts here in 2003. Please email me any plans you have. I will pay =
good money for anything you send me I can use. Or if you have a dimensiona=
l warp generator available, and are 100% certain you have a (safe secure) =
means of delivering it to me please also reply with a secure way to contac=
t you. Send a separate email to me at: webmaster@custompaintshop.net

Do not reply back directly to this email as it will only be bounced back t=
o you.

Thank You
Brian Appel
