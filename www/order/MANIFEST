# Here is a list of the included packages:


a2ps-4.12/
   GNU a2ps is an Any-to-PostScript filter.  It can pretty-print many
   popular languages, in addition to plain text files.


abuse-2.0/
   Abuse is an action game written by Jonathan Clark, and released as free
   software by the company Crack dot Com.  It was initially developed on
   Linux-based GNU systems.


acct-6.3.2/
   Acct (the GNU Accounting Utilities package) contains system-accounting
   commands, such as `ac', `last' and `sa'.


acm-4.8/
   Acm is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation.  Players
   engage in air to air combat against one another using heat seeking
   missiles and cannons.


adns-0.4/
   Advanced, easy to use, asynchronous-capable DNS client library.


aegis-3.19/
   Aegis is a project change supervisor.  It provides a framework within which
   a team of developers may work on many changes to a program independently,
   and Aegis coordinates integrating these changes back into the master source
   of the program, with as little disruption as possible.  Resolution of
   contention for source files, a major headache for any project with more
   than one developer, is one of Aegis's major functions.

   It should be noted that Aegis is a developer's tool, in the same sense as
   make or RCS are developer's tools.  It is not a manager's tool -- it does
   not provide progress tracking or manage work allocation.


apache-1.3.6/
   Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the
   NCSA server version 1.3 (or 1.4).  It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA
   server and includes many frequently requested new features, and has an
   API which allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily.


autoconf-2.13/
   Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that creates a
   non-interactive configuration script for a package from a template
   file.  The template file lists the operating system features that the
   package can use, in the form of m4 macro calls, and can also contain
   arbitrary shell commands.  Autoconf requires GNU m4.

   Autoconf-generated configure scripts are being used by many GNU
   packages currently, and will be used by more in the future.


automake-1.4/
   Automake is a tool for generating `Makefile.in's for use with
   Autoconf.  The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile
   standards.


avl-1.4.0/
   A library for manipulation of balanced binary trees.


barcode-0.92/
   The package is meant to solve most needs in barcode creation with a
   conventional printer.  It can create printouts for the conventional
   product-tagging standards: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, ISBN.  Output
   is generated as either Postscript or Encapsulated Postscript (other
   back-ends may be added if needed).


bash-2.03/
   BASH (the Bourne Again SHell) is a Posix-compatible shell with full
   Bourne shell (`sh') syntax and some C-shell commands.  BASH supports
   emacs-style command-line editing, job control, functions, and on-line
   help.  Instructions for compiling BASH may be found in the file
   "README".


bc-1.05a/
   `bc' is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision.
   GNU `bc' was implemented from the POSIX 1003.2 draft standard, but it
   has several extensions including multi-character variable names, an
   `else' statement, and full Boolean expressions.

   GNU `bc' does not use the historical method of being a compiler for
   the `dc' calculator.  This version has a single executable that both
   compiles the language and runs the resulting "byte code".  The "byte
   code" is NOT the `dc' language.

   Instructions for compiling `bc' are in the file "Install".


binutils-2.9.1/
   This is a beta release of a completely rewritten binutils
   distribution.  These programs have been tested on various
   architectures.  Most recently tested are sun3 and sun4s running
   sunos4, as well as Sony News running newsos3.  However, since this is
   a beta release taken directly from an evolving source tree, there
   might be some problems.  In particular, the programs have not been
   ported to as many machines as the old binutils.  There are also
   features of the old versions that are missing on the new programs.  We
   would appreciate patches to make things run on other machines;
   especially welcome are fixes for what used to work on the old
   programs!

   This release contains the following programs: `ar', `demangle', `ld'
   (the linker), `gas' (the assembler), `nm', `objcopy', `objdump',
   `ranlib', `size', `strip', and `gprof'.

   GAS is the GNU assembler, which has now been merged with binutils.
   Version 2 has many changes over previous GAS releases.  Most notable
   among the changes are the separation of host system, target CPU, and
   target file format (i.e. cross-assembling is much easier).  Many CPU
   types and object file formats are now supported.

   BFD (the Binary File Descripter) library is in the subdirectory `bfd'
   and is built along with the various binutils.

   See the "README" file for further instructions on where to look for
   building the various utilities.


bison-1.28/
   Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
   `yacc', with more features.  The file "README" gives instructions for
   compiling Bison; the files `bison.1' (a man page) and `bison.texinfo'
   (a GNU Texinfo file) give instructions for using it.


btyacc-3.0/
   btyacc is a public-domain backtracking implementation of yacc.


calc-2.02f/
   Calc is an extensible, advanced desk calculator and mathematical tool
   that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  It comes with source for the Calc
   Manual, which serves as a tutorial and reference.  If you wish, you
   can use Calc only as a simple four-function calculator, but it
   provides additional features including choice of algebraic or RPN
   (stack-based) entry, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and
   financial functions, arbitrary precision, complex numbers, vectors,
   matrices, dates, times, infinities, sets, algebraic simplification,
   differentiation, and integration.  Instructions for install Calc for
   emacs are in the "README" file.


cfengine-1.5.1/
   cfengine is a tool designed for configuring and maintaining site-wide
   configuration of a heterogenous unix network using a simple high level
   language.


cgicc-3.1/
   GNU Cgicc is an ANSI C++ compliant class library that greatly
   simplifies the creation of CGI applications for the World Wide Web.


clisp-1999.07.22/
   CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael
   Stoll.  It supports the ANSI Common Lisp standard, including CLOS.

   CLISP runs on Unix, Win32, OS/2 and other platforms, and needs only
   2 MB of RAM.  The user interface comes in German, English, French
   and Spanish.  CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a foreign
   language interface and a socket interface.  An X11 interface is
   available through CLX and Garnet.


clx-5.02/
   CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.


cook-2.10/
   Put simply, the cook program is yet another make-oid.

   The cook program is a tool for constructing files, and maintaining
   referential integrity between files.  It is given a set of files to create,
   and recipes of how to create and maintain them.  In any non-trivial program
   there will be prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to creating
   any file, such as include files.  The cook program provides a mechanism to
   define these.


cpio-2.4.2/
   `cpio' is a program for creating, updating, and extracting archives.
   GNU `cpio' supports the final POSIX 1003.1 "ustar" standard.
   Instructions for compiling `cpio' are in the file "README".


cvs-1.10/
   CVS is a collection of programs that provide for software release and
   revision control functions.  CVS is designed to work on top of RCS
   version 4.  It will parse older RCS formats, but cannot use any of its
   fancier features without RCS branch support.  The file "README"
   contains more information about CVS.


cvsweb-1.0/
   cvsweb is a WWW CGI script that allows remote access to a CVS tree.
   It allows browsing of the full tree; no access controls are
   implemented.  It can display the revision history of a file, as well
   as diffs between revisions and downloading the whole file.


cxref-1.5a/
   Cxref is a program that can automatically generates documentation and cross
   references for a C program.  The input is any C program with appropriate
   comments and the output is LaTeX or HTML files.


ddd-3.1.6/
   DDD is the Data Display Debugger, an X Windows based graphical front
   end to the gdb and dbx debuggers.


dejagnu-1.3/
   DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to
   provide a single front end for all tests.  For more information read
   the "README" file.


dgs-0.5.7/
   The Display Ghostscript System is functionally upward-compatible with
   Adobe Display PostScript, but it has been written independently.  The
   Display Ghostscript System provides a device-independent imaging model
   for displaying information on a screen.  The imaging model uses the
   PostScript language which has powerful graphics capabilities and frees
   the programmer from display-specific details like screen resolution and
   color issues.


diction-0.8/
   This package contains GNU diction and style, free implementations of old
   standard unix commands, that are not available on many modern systems,
   because they have been unbundled.  Diction prints wordy and commonly
   misused phrases.  Style analyses surface characteristics of a document,
   e.g., sentence length and various readability measures.


diffutils-2.7/
   `diff' compares files showing line-by-line changes in several flexible
   formats.  GNU `diff' is much faster than the traditional Unix
   versions.  This distribution includes `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', and
   `cmp'.  Instructions for compiling these are in the "README" file.


dld-3.3/
   Dld is a library package of C functions that performs "dynamic link
   editing".  Programs that use dld can add compiled object code to or
   remove such code from a process anytime during its execution.  Loading
   modules, searching libraries, resolving external references, and
   allocating storage for global and static data structures are all
   performed at run time.

   Dld works on VAX, Sun 3, SPARCstation, Sequent Symmetry, and Atari ST
   machines.


doschk-1.1/
   This program is intended as a utility to help software developers
   ensure that their source file names are distinguishable on MS-DOS and
   14-character SYSV platforms.


dosemu-0.98.8/
   This package allows MS-DOS programs to be started in Linux.
   A virtual machine (the DOS box) provides the necessary BIOS functions
   and emulates most of the chip devices
   (e.g., timer, interrupt- and keyboard controller).


dumb-0.13.9/
   DUMB is a 3D game engine, reminiscent of id software's Doom.


ed-0.2/
   Ed is the standard text editor.


electric-5.4g6/
   GNU Electric is an electrical CAD system.


elib-1.0/
   This is a small library of emacs-lisp functions, including routines
   for using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.


elisp-archive-1998.03.12/
   This is a snapshot of the GNU Emacs Lisp Archive at Ohio State
   University.


elisp-manual-19-2.4.2/
   This is the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference manual with texinfo source and a
   DVI file that's ready for printing.  The manual documents the
   extension language used by GNU Emacs 19.


elisp-manual-19jp-2.4.2.0/
   This is the Japanese Edition of the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference manual
   with texinfo source and a DVI file that's ready for printing.  The
   manual documents the extension language used by GNU Emacs 19.


elisp-manual-20-2.5/
   This is the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference manual with texinfo source and a
   DVI file that's ready for printing.  The manual documents the
   extension language used by GNU Emacs 20.


emacs-19.34b/
   GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable fullscreen editor.  Read the
   files "README" and "INSTALL" for a full description of the parts of
   GNU Emacs, and the steps needed to install it.  This distribution
   includes the complete GNU Emacs Manual.

   19.34b is the last release of emacs version 19.


emacs-20.4/
   Emacs version 20 supports a wide variety of international character sets,
   including European variants of the Latin alphabet, as well as Chinese,
   Devanagari (Hindi and Marathi), Ethiopian, Greek, IPA, Japanese, Korean,
   Lao, Russian, Thai, Tibetan, and Vietnamese scripts.  These features have
   been merged from the modified version of Emacs known as MULE (for
   "MULti-lingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs").


emacs-lisp-intro-1.05/
   ``Programming in Emacs Lisp, An Introduction'' (Edition 1.05 for
   Version 19.29) is for people who are not necessarily interested in
   programming, but who do want to customize or extend their computing
   environment.  If you read it in Emacs under Info mode, you can run the
   sample programs directly.


empire-4.2.6/
   Empire is a multi-player, client/server Internet based war game.


enscript-1.6.1/
   Enscript is an upwardly-compatible replacement for the Adobe enscript.
   It formats ASCII files (outputting in Postscript) and stores generated
   output to a file or sends it directly to the printer.


es-0.9-beta1/
   This is an extensible shell based on `rc' but with more features
   including first class functions, lexical scope, an exception system,
   and rich return values (i.e. functions can return values other than
   just numbers).  Like rc, it is great for both interactive use and for
   scripting, particularly because its quoting semantics are much less
   baroque than the Bourne shell.


exim-3.03/
   Exim is a mail transfer agent, patterned after some of the lessons
   learned during the development of Smail.  Exim has a flexible
   configuration, and can handle relatively high volume mail systems,
   header rewriting, multiple local domains from one mail system
   (virtual domains), and control over which hosts/nets may use it as a
   relay.  It also has interfaces to LDAP and MYSQL.


f2c-1998.10.14/
   This is a Fortran-to-C converter program.  Instructions for compiling
   it are in the file "src/README".


ffcall-1.6/
   ffcall is the foreign function call library, a collection of C
   libraries for calling external functions in embedded interpreters.


fileutils-4.0/
   These are the GNU file-manipulation utilities.  Instructions for
   compiling these utilities are in the file "README".  The fileutils
   package contains the following programs: chgrp chmod chown cp dd df
   dir du ginstall ln ls mkdir mkfifo mknod mv rm rmdir touch vdir.


findutils-4.1/
   This is a posix-compliant implementation (with many extensions) of
   `find', a program used for searching filesystems for files that match
   certain criteria and performing operations (like showing the path)
   when they are found.  Also included in this distribution are `xargs'
   and `locate'.


finger-1.37/
   GNU Finger is a utility program designed to allow users of Unix hosts
   on the Internet network to get information about each other.  It is a
   direct replacement for the Berkeley 4.3 `finger' program, although it
   produces different looking output.  For more information about why,
   read "finger-1.37/doc/finger.texinfo".  Instructions for building
   finger itself are in the "README" file.


flex-2.5.4a/
   This is a faster, but not completely compatible replacement for `lex',
   a lexical-analyzer-compiler.  Instructions for compiling `flex' are in
   the file "README".


fontutils-0.6/
   These are the GNU font utilities.  There are various programs for
   converting between various bitmaps and other graphical data formats,
   creating fonts using Ghostscript, and other frobnicating utilities.
   You will need GCC and GNU Make to compile these programs.  For the
   programs which do online graphics, you will need an X11 server and the
   X11R4 or R5 libraries.  Instructions for building the fontutils are in
   the "README" file.


freedos-0.3beta/
   FreeDOS is a DOS-like operating system compatible with Microsoft's MS-DOS.


gamma-3.5.3/
   GAMMA is a Magnetic Resonance Simulation Platform.


gawk-3.0.4/
   This version of GNU AWK is upwardly-compatible with the SVR4 version.
   Read the file "README" for instructions on compiling GAWK.
   Instructions for using GAWK are in the file "gawk.texinfo".


gcal-2.40/
   Gcal is a program for printing calendars.  It displays different
   styled calendar sheets, eternal holiday lists, and fixed date warning
   lists.


gcc-2.95.1/
   This is version 2 of GCC, the GNU C Compiler.  In addition to
   supporting ANSI C, GCC Version 2 includes support for the programming
   languages C++, Objective C, Fortran, and Java.

   GCC extends the C language to support nested functions, non-local
   gotos, taking the address of program labels, and unnamed structures as
   function arguments (among other things).  There are also many new
   warnings for frequent programming mistakes.

   GCC 2 can generate output files in a.out, COFF, ECOFF, ELF, XCOFF,
   VAX-VMS and OSF-Rose formats when used with a suitable assembler.  It
   can produce debugging information in several formats: BSD stabs, COFF,
   ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs symbols, VAX-VMS and DWARF.  (We may support
   XCOFF for the RS/6000 in the future.)

   GCC can be easily configured as a cross-compiler, running on one
   platform while generating code for another.

   GCC Version 2 supports compatible calling conventions for function
   calling and return values on the Sparc (unlike version 1) as well as
   the other machine types.

   Early testing of GCC Version 2 indicates that it produces faster code
   for SPARC computers than Sun's latest released compilers (both bundled
   and unbundled).  It is also the fastest known compiler for the
   Motorola 88k.

   GCC Version 2 can produce position-independent code for several types
   of CPU: 68000, 88000, 80386, Sparc, and RS/6000.  Supporting PIC on
   additional suitable CPU types is not too difficult a task.

   A list of supported systems and instructions for compiling GCC are in
   the file "INSTALL".


gcl-2.2.2/
   GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp.
   It is very portable and extremely efficient on a wide class of
   applications.  It compares favorably in performance with commercial
   Lisps on several large theorem prover and symbolic algebra systems.
   It supports the CLtL1 specification but is moving towards the proposed
   ANSI definition.  It is based on AKCL and KCL.  KCL was written by
   Taiichi Yuasa and Masami Hagiya in 1984, and AKCL has been developed
   by William Schelter since 1987.

   GCL compiles to C and then uses the native optimizing C compilers
   (e.g.  GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args and one value
   turns into a C function of the same number of args and returning 1
   value, so it cannot really be any more efficient on such calls.  It
   has a conservative GC which allows great freedom for the C compiler to
   put Lisp values in arbitrary registers.  It has a source level Lisp
   debugger for interpreted code, with display of source code in the
   other Emacs window.  It has profiling tools based on the C profiling
   tools, which count function calls and percentage of time.  CLX works
   with GCL.  There is an Xlib interface via C.


gd-1.6.3/
   gd is a graphics library.  It allows your code to quickly draw images
   complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
   other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a GIF
   file.  This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
   where GIF is the format commonly used for inline images.


gdb-4.18/
   This is the GNU source-level debugger.


gdbm-1.8.0/
   This is the beta-test version of the GNU DBM library.  DBM is a set of
   library routines which implement a database using quick lookup by
   hashing.  See the file "README" for further details.


generic-nqs-3.50.5/
   Generic NQS is a network queuing system for spreading batch jobs
   across a network of machines.  It is designed to be simple to install
   on a heterogeneous network of machines, and has optimizations for
   running on the high end, symmetric multiprocessing servers that are
   currently on the market.  It inter-operates with other NQS systems,
   including Cray's NQE.


geomview-1.6.1.9/
   Geomview is an interactive geometry viewing program.  It allows
   multiple independently controllable objects and cameras.  Geomview
   provides interactive control for motion, appearances (including
   lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an object, edge or
   vertex level, and snapshots in SGI image file or Renderman RIB format.
   Adding or deleting objects is provided through direct mouse
   manipulation, control panels, and keyboard shortcuts.  External
   programs can drive desired aspects of the viewer (such as continually
   loading changing geometry or controlling the motion of certain
   objects) while allowing interactive control of everything else.


gettext-0.10.35/
   The GNU gettext package is a library of programs for aiding package
   maintainers in internationalizing their programs.


gforth-0.4.0/
   Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
   works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice features such as input
   completion (with history) and a powerful locals facility, and it even has
   (the beginnings of) a manual.  Gforth employs traditional implementation
   techniques: its inner innerpreter is indirect or direct threaded.


ghostscript-5.10/
   This program is an interpreter for a language that is intended to be,
   and very nearly is, compatible with the PostScript language.  It runs
   under X on Unix and VMS systems, and also runs on MS-DOS machines.  It
   will drive either displays or low-to-medium-resolution printers.


ghostview-1.5/
   Ghostview allows you to view PostScript(TM) files on X11 displays.
   Ghostview handles the user interface details and calls the
   `ghostscript' interpreter to render the image.  Instructions for
   compiling ghostview are in the "README" file.


gimp-1.0.4/
   The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program, a replacement for
   Adobe Photoshop.


gimp-data-extras-1.0.0/
   Additional data files necessary for the GIMP.


git-4.3.19/
   `GIT' is a set of interactive tools.  It contains an extensible file
   system browser, an ascii/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer and
   some other related utilities and shell scripts.  It can be used to
   increase the speed and efficiency of most of the daily tasks as
   copying and moving files and directories, invoking editors,
   compressing and uncompressing files, creating and expanding archives,
   compiling programs, sending mail, etc.  It looks nice, has colors (if
   the standard ANSI color sequences are supported) and is user-friendly.


gleem-1.0/
   gleem is a small, self-contained C++ library of 3D widgets that
   support direct user interaction with a 3D scene.


glib-1.2.3/
   GLIB is a library of routines to make C programming more
   convenient. It is required for GTK+ and GNOME.


glibc-1.09.1/
   This is version 1 of the GNU C library, provided for the benefit of
   systems where the newer version is not yet supported.


glibc-2.1.1/
   The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
   1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the
   underlying system permits), and most of the functions in POSIX
   1003.2-1992.  It is nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2
   specification which guarantees upward compatibility with 4.4BSD and
   many System V functions.

   When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of
   the Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast
   malloc which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.

   GNU stdio lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a few
   C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help
   writing internationalized programs and the user can adopt the
   environment the program runs in to conform with local conventions.
   Extended getopt functions are already used to parse options,
   including long options, in many GNU utilities.  The name lookup
   functions now are modularized which makes it easier to select the
   service which is needed for the specific database and the document
   interface makes it easy to add new services.  Texinfo source for the
   GNU C Library Reference Manual is included.

   Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of
   systems.  The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not
   been updated since development on version 2.0 started, so today it
   runs out of the box only on GNU/Hurd (all platforms GNU/Hurd also
   runs on) and GNU/Linux (ix86, Alpha, m68k, MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC; work
   is in progress for ARM).  Other architectures will become available
   again as soon as somebody does the port.

   based upon the paradigm of a central site or organization which
   receives problem reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic
   mail.  Although it's been used primarily as a software bug-tracking
   system so far, it is sufficiently generalized so that it could be used
   for handling system administration issues, project management, or any
   number of other applications.

   GPC is the GNU Pascal compiler.  It supports Standard Pascal (according
   to ISO 7185), large parts of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206), is compatible to
   Borland Pascal (version 7), and supports other Pascal standards (Delphi,
   UCSD Pascal, Pascal-SC) in so far as this serves the goal of clarity and
   usability.  GPC can generate code and run on any computer for which the
   GNU C compiler can generate code and run, and it shares GCC's abilities
   of cross-compilation and high optimization.  For more information, see
   http://home.pages.de/~GNU-Pascal/.


gperf-2.7/
   This is a program to generate minimally perfect hash functions for
   sets of keywords.  GCC was optimized by using this program.  Other
   programs that must recognize a set of keywords may also benefit from
   using this program.  Instructions for compiling cperf may be found in
   the file "README".

   This is the C++ version formerly distributed with libg++, now packaged
   separately.  The version written in C has been withdrawn.

   `fgrep'.  They are similar to their Unix counterparts, but are usually
   faster.  Instructions for compiling them are in the file "README".


grg-1.43/
   The GRG program reads record and field information from a dBase3+
   file, delimited ASCII text file, or an SQL query to a RDBMS and
   produces a report listing.  The program was loosely designed to
   produce TeX/LaTeX formatted output, but plain ASCII text, troff,
   PostScript, HTML or any other kind of ASCII based output format can
   be produced just as easily.


groff-1.11.1/
   Groff is a document formatting system, which includes drivers for
   Postscript, TeX `dvi' format, and typewriter-like devices, as well as
   implementations of `eqn', `nroff', `pic', `refer', `tbl', `troff', and

   linked in as a library when building extensible programs.

   Guile was originally based on Aubrey Jaffer's SCM scheme interpreter
   (which was in turn based on George Carrette's SIOD).  The project has
   evolved SCM into a library, added some features to make the interpreter
   more flexible, and added some new types and extension packages.  The
   goal is to make a small, portable, powerfully scalable extension
   langauge library.


guile-oops-0.1.2/
   GOOPS is the object oriented extention to Guile.  It gives the user a
   full object oriented system with multiple inheritance and generic
   functions with multi-method dispatch.


gzip-1.2.4a/
   This is a new compression program free of known patents which the GNU
   Project is using instead of the traditional `compress' program (which
   has patent problems).  Gzip can uncompress LZW-compressed files but
   uses a different algorithm for compression which generally yields
   smaller compressed files.  This will be the standard compression
   program in the GNU system.


hello-1.3/
   The GNU `hello' program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
   allows nonprogrammers to use a classic computer science tool which
   would otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by
   the GNU General Public License, users are free to share and change it.


help2man-1.013/
   help2man is a script to create simple man pages from the --help and
   --version output of programs.  Since most GNU documentation is now in
   info format, this provides a way to generate a placeholder man page
   pointing to that resource while still providing some useful information.

   supported by GNU Emacs.


id-utils-3.2d/
   ID Utils is a package of simple, fast, high-capacity,
   language-independent identifier database tools.  Actually, the term
   ``identifier'' is too limiting -- ID Utils stores tokens, be they
   program identifiers of any form, literal numbers, or words of
   human-readable text.  Database queries can be issued from the
   command-line, or from within Emacs, serving as an augmented tags
   facility.


ilisp-5.8.a04/
   ILISP is a powerful GNU Emacs interface to many dialects of Lisp, including
   Lucid, Allegro, Harlequin LispWorks, GCL, KCL, AKCL, ECL, IBCL, and CMUCL.

   program from BSD.  The file "indent.texinfo" contains instructions on
   using indent.


inetutils-1.3.2/
   Inetutils is a distribution of common networking utilities and servers.

   They are currently all from the 4.4BSD-Lite2 distribution, with some
   changes to make them compatible with the GNU Hurd (in particular, the Hurd
   does not define some arbitrary limits, such as MAXPATHLEN), and to make
   them more portable, using autoconf.  A GNU build environment has also been
   added.

   There are probably many BSD dependencies remaining, but inetutils is
   believed to work on the following system types (and others may work):
     i486-gnu0.2
     i486-pc-linux-gnu
     m68k-hp-netbsd1.2
     sparc-sun-netbsd1.2

   pagers lack.  Instructions for compiling `less' are in the file
   "README".


lesstif-0.88.9/
   Lesstif is an API compatible clone of the Motif toolkit.


libg++-2.8.1.1a/
   This is a libg++ addon for libstdc++ 2.8.1.1.  It is needed only if
   your applications depend on libg++ and you cannot easily remove the
   dependency on libg++; it is no longer maintained, and new programs
   should avoid using it.


libgcj-2.95.1/
   libgcj is the runtime for the Java front end to gcc.

   `m4' is a macro processor, in the sense that in copies its input to
   the output, expanding macros as it goes.  Macros are either built-in
   or user-defined, and can take any number of arguments.  Besides just
   doing macro expansion, `m4' has built-in functions for including named
   files, running Unix commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating
   text in various ways, recursion, etc.  Instructions for building m4
   are in the "README" file.


make-3.77/
   This is GNU Make.  GNU Make supports many more options and features
   than the Unix make.  Instructions for using GNU Make are in the file
   "make.texinfo".  See the file "README" for installation instructions.

   performs standard or Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.  It allows
   you to specify a set of linear or nonlinear equations (eventually
   differential), and solve them using parameter values you choose or
   parameter values sampled from specified statistical distributions.
   Simulation outputs can be compared to experimental data for parameter
   estimation.


mesa-demos-3.0/
   This directory contains demo programs to accompany mesa-lib.


mesa-lib-3.0/
   Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that
   of OpenGL.


metahtml-5.091/
   <Meta-HTML> is a programming language specifically designed for working
   within the World Wide Web environment.  Although it is a genuine
   programming language, suitable for large-scale symbolic manipulation,
   it provides the most commonly wanted Web functionality as built-in
   primitives, so you don't have to write them.  You can find out more
   about the theory of implementation in this white paper
   [http://www.metahtml.com/meta-html/manifesto.html].

   Web pages are authored using HTML and <Meta-HTML> statements freely
   intermixed.  When a page is requested by a browser, the page is passed
   through the <Meta-HTML> engine, which dynamically processes any
   <Meta-HTML> statements to produce a final HTML page which is delivered
   to the browser.

   The source distribution provides several different interpreter options:

      * A CGI engine which can be run by any Unix Web server,
      * A full-featured Web server (mhttpd) with the interpreter built in,
      * A standalone processor, much like Perl or Tcl, and
      * An interactive debugger, with a feel similar to GDB (mdb)


mig-1.1/
   This is the GNU distribution of the Mach 3.0 interface generator `MiG'.

   The GNU Miscellaneous Files Distribution includes non-crucial files
   which have come to be common on various systems over the years,
   including word lists, airport codes, ZIP codes and more.


mkisofs-1.11.3/
   mkisofs is a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO9660 filesystem.
   It takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a binary
   image which will correspond to an ISO9660 filesystem when written to a
   block device.

   mkisofs is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol
   records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.  This is
   used to further describe the files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a unix
   host, and provides information such as longer filenames, uid/gid,
   POSIX permissions, and block and character devices.


mm-1.07/
   This is a macro package for groff.  It is supposed to be compatible
   with the DWB `mm' macros, and has several extensions.  See the "README"
   file for more details.

   only ASCII characters (7 bits) and ISO Latin-1 (8 bits), but also
   Japanese, Chinese, Korean (16 bits) coded in the ISO2022 standard and
   its variants (e.g. EUC, Compound Text).  For Chinese there is support
   for both GB and Big5.  In addition, Thai (based on TIS620) and
   Vietnamese (based on VISCII and VSCII) are also supported.  A text
   buffer in Mule can contain a mixture of characters from these
   languages.  To input any of these characters, you can use various
   input methods provided by Mule itself.  In addition, if you use Mule
   under some terminal emulator (kterm, cxterm, or exterm), you can use
   any input methods supported by the emulator.


mutt-0.95.6i/
   Mutt is a small but very powerful curses-based mail client for Unix-like
   operating systems.  Some of its features include: color support, message
   threading, MIME support (including RFC1522 support for encoded headers),
   customizable key bindings, indefinite postponement of outgoing messages,
   POP3 support, Delivery Status Notification (DSN) support, and PGP/MIME
   support (US/Canada only).

   The best way to describe this mail user agent (MUA) is to say that it's a
   hybrid, or ``mutt,'' consisting of features from various other curses-based
   e-mail clients.  Its interface was initially based on ELM, but hints of
   PINE, MUSH and SLRN are also present.

   The most recent copy of the manual is available on the WWW at
   http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~me/mutt.


nana-2.4/
   Nana is a debugging-support library; it provides improved support for
   assertion checking and logging, for programs written in C, C++ and Ada.

   using nethack may be found in the "README" file.


nvi-1.79/
   `nvi' is a free implementation of the `vi'/`ex' Unix editor.  It has
   most of the functionality of the original `vi'/`ex', except "open" mode
   & the `lisp' option, which will be added.  Enhancements over `vi'/`ex'
   include split screens with multiple buffers, ability to handle 8-bit
   data, infinite file & line lengths, tag stacks, infinite undo & extended
   regular expressions.  It runs under BSD, Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, BSDI,
   AIX, HP-UX, DGUX, IRIX, PSF, PTX, Solaris, SunOS, Ultrix, Unixware &
   should port easily to many other systems.

   solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions over
   finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary
   differential and differential-algebraic equations.

   The Octave distribution includes a 150+ page Texinfo manual.


oleo-1.99.5/
   Oleo is a spreadsheet program (better for you than the more expensive
   spreadsheet).  It supports X windows and character-based terminals,
   and can generate embedded PostScript renditions of spreadsheets.
   Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs users and are configurable by
   users.


p2c-1.20.1/
   This is a Pascal to C conversion program.


patch-2.5.4/

   (in the same sense as `gnuplot'), and include GNU libplot, a set of
   subroutine libraries for producing 2-D device-independent vector graphics.


prcs-1.2.14/
   PRCS is the front end to a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way
   to deal with sets of files and directories as an entity, preserving
   coherent versions of the entire set.

   Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according to
   its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those systems.


pth-1.1.5/
   Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
   which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
   threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server applications.
   All threads run in the same address space of the server application,
   but each thread has its own individual program-counter, run-time
   stack, signal mask and errno variable.


queue-1.12.8/
   Queue is a load-balancing/distributed batch processing and local rsh
   replacement system.


r-0.65.0/
   R is a language which is not entirely unlike (version 3 of) the S
   language developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories.


rc-1.6/
   rc is a shell which features a C-like syntax (much more so than `csh')
   and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.  It's
   intended to be used interactively, but is great for writing scripts as
   well.


rcs-5.7/
   This is the Revision Control System, a program to manage multiple
   versions of a software project.  This program keeps the changes from
   one version to another rather than multiple copies of the entire file;
   this saves disk space.  Instructions for compiling RCS are in the file
   "README".


readline-4.0/
   The GNU Readline Library aids in the consistency of user interface
   across discrete programs that need to provide a command line interface.
   It supports both emacs and vi-style editing.


recode-3.5/
   `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When exact
   transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
   characters or fall back on approximations.  This program recognizes or
   produces nearly 150 different charsets and is able to transliterate
   files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 charsets are supported.


regex-0.12/
   The GNU regex library routines.  It is compliant with POSIX.2, except
   for internationalization features.  It also includes a programmer's
   reference manual for the library (which is slightly out of date for
   version 0.12).

   This release is probably out of date; newer versions of these routines
   are typically distributed along with programs which use them.


roxen-1.1/
   Roxen is a free World Wide Web Server that features high performance and a
   module system for improved extendability.  It used to be called `spinner'.

   For more information about Roxen, read the online documentation at
   http://roxen.com/


rsync-2.3.1/
   rsync is a replacement for rcp that has many more features.

   rsync uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for
   bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the
   differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
   sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.


rx-1.5/
   Rx is a regular expression library.  It is often faster and more
   correct than the GNU regex library, but it is still under development.


sane-1.0.1/
   SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) is a universal scanner interface.  The
   value of such a universal interface is that it allows writing just
   one driver per image acquisition device rather than one driver for
   each device and application.  So, if you have three applications and
   four devices, traditionally you'd have had to write 12 different
   programs.  With SANE, this number is reduced to seven: the three
   applications plus the four drivers.  Of course, the savings get even
   bigger as more and more drivers and/or applications are added.


saoimage-1.26/
   SAOimage is an astronomical image viewer (which runs under X) that
   reads data images and displays them with a pseudocolor colormap.  You
   have full interactive control of the colormap, can read and write
   colormaps, etc.  The data can be in 1- 2- and 4-byte signed or
   unsigned integers, and 4- or 8-byte floating-point formats.

   SAOimage reads many common astronomical image data formats including
   the ubiquitous FITS format that none of the programs that claim to
   read "all the standard image formats" seem to read.  It can handle raw
   binary data without a header, so it's ideal as a general tool to look
   at data from peoples' home-grown fractal hacks, etc.  It has a region
   magnifier, lets you zoom arbitrarily, can remap the image according to
   log, histeq, sqrt, etc. scales, does gamma correction, and can
   interact with other programs via FIFOs to give cursor position or to
   load images in a server mode.  Images can be arbitrarily large; it
   subsamples if necessary.  There is a large manual written in TeX.
   It's been widely ported.


screen-3.9.4/
   `screen' is a window manager that allows you to handle several
   independent screens (UNIX ttys) on a single physical terminal; each
   screen has its own set of processes connected to it (typically
   interactive shells).  Each virtual terminal created by `screen'
   emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions
   (including DEC VT102 features such as line and character deletion and
   insertion).  See the "README" file for details on compiling screen.


sed-3.02/
   `sed' is a stream editor, useful for doing ed-like editing operations
   noninteractively on selected subsets of lines in an input stream.


sh-utils-2.0/
   These are the GNU shell utilities, comprising small commands that are
   frequently run on the command line or in shell scripts.  Instructions
   for compiling these utilities are in the file "README".  The sh-utils
   package contains the following programs: basename date dirname echo
   env expr false groups hostname id logname nice nohup pathchk printenv
   printf pwd sleep stty su tee test true tty uname users who whoami yes.

   and the uu*code family of programs.


shtool-1.4.6/
   The GNU shtool program is a compilation of small but very stable and
   portable shell scripts into a single shell tool.  All ingredients
   were in successful use over many years in various free software
   projects.  The compiled shtool program is intended to be used inside
   the source tree of free software packages.  There it can take over
   various (usually non-portable) tasks related to the building and
   installation of such packages.


sipp-3.1/
   SIPP is a library for creating 3-dimensional scenes and rendering them
   using a scan-line z-buffer algorithm.  A scene is built up of objects
   which can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The
   objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many
   subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected
   polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat
   shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the
   polygon edges without any shading at all.


smail-3.2.0.107/
   Smail is a mail transport system, designed as a compatible drop-in
   replacement for sendmail.  It uses a much simpler configuration format
   than sendmail is designed to be setup with minimal effort.


smalltalk-1.6.2/
   This is the GNU implementation of Smalltalk, an object-oriented
   programming language.


sneps-2.4.0/
   SNePS is the Semantic Network Processing System.  It is the
   implementation of a fully intensional theory of propositional
   knowledge representation and reasoning.  SNePS runs on a variety
   of Lisps (CLISP, GCL, Allegro, Lucid, etc.) and OS platforms
   (Unix, TI-Explorers, Mac).


spell-1.0/
   GNU Spell is a clone of standard Unix `spell'.  It is implemented as a
   wrapper around Ispell, so you must install Ispell before Spell will work.


stow-1.3.2/
   GNU Stow is a program for managing the installation of software packages,
   keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for
   example) while making them appear to be installed in the same place
   (/usr/local).

   Stow is a Perl script which should run correctly under Perl 4 and Perl 5.
   You must install Perl before running Stow.

   You can get the latest information about Stow from
   `http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html'.


stump-2.3/
   STUMP is a free robomoderator program for moderators of USENET
   newsgroups and mailing lists.  (See also webstump.)


superopt-2.5/
   The superoptimizer is a function sequence generator that uses a
   exhaustive generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction
   sequence for a given function.

   The GNU superoptimizer and its application in GCC is described in the
   ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92 proceedings.


swarm-1.4.1/
   Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex
   systems being developed at The Santa Fe Institute; it is intended to be
   a useful tool for researchers in a variety of disciplines, especially
   artificial life.  The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of
   collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this architecture,
   we can implement a large variety of agent based models.


swarmapps-1.4.1/
   This directory contains various applications for the `swarm' package,
   distributed separately.

   English into dialect.  Includes jive, valspeak, etc.


tar-1.13/
   Tar is a program used for archiving many files in a single file, which
   makes them easier to transport.

   GNU tar includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
   files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives,
   and special features to allow tar to be used for incremental and full
   backups.  Unfortunately GNU tar implements an early draft of the POSIX
   1003.1 `ustar standard which is different from the final standard.
   Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible fashion is
   not trivial.


tcl-8.0.5/
   Tcl is an embeddable scripting language.


termcap-1.3/
   This is a standalone release of the GNU Termcap library, which has
   been part of the GNU Emacs distribution for years but is now available
   separately to make it easier to install as `libtermcap.a'.  The GNU
   Termcap library does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of
   termcap entries, unlike most other termcap libraries.  Included is
   extensive documentation in Texinfo format.  Unfortunately, this
   release does not have a termcap database included.  Instructions for
   building the termcap library are in the "README" file.


termutils-2.0/
   The GNU termutils package contains tput and tabs. tput is a program to
   enable shell scripts to portably use special terminal capabilities.
   Although its interface is similar to that of terminfo-based tput
   programs, it actually uses termcap.  tabs is a program to set hardware
   terminal tab settings.


tex-3.1415/
   This is version 3.1415 of the C TeX translation from the original
   WEB version.  TeX is used for all of the GNU Project's documentation.

   This package contains a set of utilities related to Texinfo, which is
   used to generate printed manuals and online hypertext-style manuals
   (called `info').  Programs and interfaces for writing, reading, and
   formatting texinfo files are available both as standalone programs and
   as GNU Emacs interfaces.  See the file "README" for directions on how
   to use the various parts of this package.


textutils-2.0/
   These are the GNU text utilities, commands that are used to operate on
   textual data.  Instructions for compiling these utilities are in the
   file "README".  The textutils package contains the following programs:
   cat cksum comm csplit cut expand fold head join nl od paste pr sort
   split sum tac tail tr unexpand uniq wc.


tiff-3.4beta037/
   The TIFF library (libtiff), is a library for manipulating Tagged
   Image File Format files, a commonly used bitmap graphics format.


tile-forth-2.1/
   TILE Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth-83 Standard written
   in C, thus allowing it to be easily moved between different computers.
   (Traditionally, Forth implementations are written in assembly to
   utilize the underlying architecture as well as possible, but this
   also makes them less portable.)


time-1.7/
   `time' is used to time commands and report statistics about, among
   other things, the amount of user, system, and approximate real time
   used by a process.  Instructions for making time (no pun intended) are
   in the file "README".


tk-8.0.5/
   Tk is an X11 toolkit implemented in Tcl.


trueprint-5.0/
   A printer interface.


ucblogo-4.6/
   An implementation of the classic teaching language Logo.


units-1.55/
   GNU units converts between different systems of units.  This is most
   commonly used for converting between English dimensions and metric,
   but the database also contains many esoteric units.


userv-0.64.1/
   A trust boundary management service for Unix.


uucp-1.06.1/
   This version of UUCP was written by Ian Lance Taylor.  It will be the
   standard UUCP system for GNU.  It currently supports the `f', `g' (in
   all window and packet sizes), `G', `t' and `e' protocols, as well a
   Zmodem protocol and two new bidirectional protocols.  If you have a
   Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  If you have
   TLI libraries, it can make TLI connections.  Other important notes
   about this version of UUCP, and instructions for building it, are in
   the file "README".


vera-1.5/
   VERA (Virtual Entity of Relevant Acronyms) is a document listing thousands
   of acronyms of the computer field.


vrweb-1.5/
   VRweb is a freely available browser for 3D worlds and scenes modeled
   in VRML (the Virtual Reality Modeling Language). VRweb is a joint
   project between IICM, home of Hyper-G, NCSA, home of Mosaic, and the
   University of Minnesota, home of Gopher.

   VRweb is the only free VRML browser available in full source code,
   which does not require commercial packages such as Inventor or Motif,
   and which will run on (almost) any Unix or Windows platform.


w3-4.0.pre44/
   W3 (written by William Perry in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
   World Wide Web browser that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  It has the
   ability to understand many protocols, including HTML, Telnet, WAIS,
   SMTP, gopher, ftp, et al.


wdiff-0.5/
   `wdiff' compares two files, finding which words have been deleted or
   added to the first for getting the second.

   We hope eventually to integrate `wdiff', as well as some ideas from a
   similar program called `spiff', into some future release of GNU
   `diff'.


webstump-2.0/
   Something useful for moderating mailing lists and newsgroups.


wget-1.5.3/
   Wget [formerly known as Geturl] is a freely available network utility
   to retrieve files from the World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two
   most widely used Internet protocols.  It works non-interactively, thus
   enabling work in the background, after having logged off.

   The recursive retrieval of HTML pages, as well as FTP sites is
   supported -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and home
   pages, or traverse the web like a WWW robot (Wget understands
   /robots.txt).

   Wget works exceedingly well on slow or unstable connections, keeping
   getting the document until it is fully retrieved. Re-getting files
   from where it left off works on servers (both HTTP and FTP) that
   support it. Matching of wildcards and recursive mirroring of
   directories are available when retrieving via FTP. Both HTTP and FTP
   retrievals can be time-stamped, thus Wget can see if the remote file
   has changed since last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new
   version if it has.


which-2.8/
   Which shows the full path of one or more commands.


windows32api-0.1.2/
   The Windows32 API Library is a set of header files and import libraries
   that can be used by GNU tools for compiling and linking programs to be
   run under operating systems supporting the Win32 Application Programming
   Interface.  The two currently known operating systems which support the
   Win32 API are Microsoft's Windows NT and Windows 95.


wn-2.0.8/
   WN is a World Wide Web server designed to be secure and flexible.  It
   offers many different capabilities in pre-parsing files before passing
   them to the client, and has a very different design from Apache and
   the NCSA server.


x11-6.4/
   This is the X11R6.4 release of the X Window System.


xaos-3.0/
   XaoS is an realtime fractal zoomer.


xaw3d-1.5/
   A set of 3-D widgets based on the R6.1/R6.3/R6.4 Athena Widget set,
   which may be used as a general replacement for the Athena (Xaw)
   Widget set.


xboard-4.0.3/
   XBoard is an X11/R4-based user interface for GNU Chess.  It uses the
   R4 Athena widgets and Xt Intrinsics to provide an interactive referee
   for managing a chess game between a user and a computer opponent or
   between two computers.  You can also use XBoard without a chess
   program to play through games in files or to play through games
   manually (force mode); in this case, moves aren't validated by XBoard.
   XBoard manages a digital chess clock for each player and resets the
   clocks if the proper number of moves are played within the time
   control period.  A game can be started with the initial chess
   position, with a series of moves from a game file or with a position
   from a position file.  The "match" shell script runs a series of games
   between two machines, alternating sides.  The man page xboard.man
   describes the features of XBoard.


xdelta-1.1.1/
   XDelta is a library interface and application program designed to
   compute changes between files.  These changes (deltas) may be used to
   store and transmit only the changes between files.  XDelta uses a
   fast, linear algorithm and performs well on both binary and text
   files.  XDelta typically outperforms GNU diff in both time and output
   size, even for plain text files.  XDelta also includes a simple
   implementation of the Rsync algorithm and several advanced features
   for implementing RCS-like file-archival.


xgrabsc-2.41/
   xgrabsc is an X-windows screen dumping utility. It is much more
   flexible than most such tools, allowing one to grab arbitrary screen
   portions and windows, and dumping them in a large number of output
   formats, including several Postscript formats, x-bitmap, and
   portable-bitmap.


xinfo-1.01.01/
   An X-based GNU info widget.


xlogmaster-1.6.0/
   Xlogmaster is an X11 program that does comfortable and fast monitoring
   of all logfiles and every device that allows its status to be read by
   cat (like the /proc devices).


xmcd-2.5/
   Xmcd is an X11/Motif-based CD player utility; this packages also includes
   cda, a command-line driven, non-graphical CD audio player.

   Xmcd uses the Motif toolkit to achieve a pleasing appearance, such that
   it actually looks and feels like a real CD player for all basic
   functions, yet takes advantage of the GUI and window system to make
   programming and CD database functions easy.

   Currently, the cda utility offers almost the same functionality as
   xmcd except the FF, REW, Sample and A->B features are not available.
   Also, the CD database is read-only via cda (no updates).  In addition,
   a visual mode is available that turns cda into a screen-oriented
   (curses-based) CD player.


xpm-3.4k/
   XPM (X PixMap) is a format for storing/retrieving X pixmaps to/from files.


ygl-4.0g/
   Ygl emulates SGI's GL (Graphics Language) library under X11.  It runs
   fine under AIX 3.2, HP-UX 7.0/8.0/9.0, Linux with XFree, SunOS,
   ConvexOS and many others.


zlib-1.1.3/
   zlib is a general purpose data compression library.


zlibc-0.9e/
   Zlibc is a preloadable shared object that allows executables to
   uncompress the datafiles that they need on the fly.  No kernel patch, no
   recompilation of these executables and no recompilation of the libraries
   is needed.


zsh-3.1.6/
   Zsh is a "hacker's shell" with lots of features.
