"I wrote the free software song at a <a href=\"#filksinging\"> "
"filksinging</a> session at a science fiction convention, probably in early "
"1991.  It was a &ldquo;bardic circle&rdquo; session, which means each person "
"in turn around the hall had the chance to either sing or ask someone else to "
"sing.  I had just had my turn, and there were 20 or more people there, so I "
"knew it would be a long time before I had another turn.  I decided to pass "
"the time writing a filksong.  This meant I was not starting with any "
"particular inspiration in mind.  I had to look for what to write about and "
"how."

"So first I asked myself, what topic should it be about? I realized I had "
"never written a filksong relating to free software, so I figured it was time "
"I did."

"Then I asked myself, what tune should I use? I realized I had never written "
"a filksong using Bulgarian dance music, so I figured that would be a good "
"thing to do for once.  I chose <cite>Sadi Moma</cite> because it is not too "
"fast or complicated, and is easy to sing."

"By the time it was my turn again, the song was ready.  After I sang it, "
"someone else in the room said, &ldquo;That has an anthem-like quality.  You "
"should show it to Richard Stallman.&rdquo; (That year was the time I was a "
"little famous and I was a guest at the convention.)"

"&ldquo;filksong&rdquo; started as a typo for &ldquo;folksong&rdquo;, and the "
"term was adopted in science fiction fandom to refer to the practice of "
"singing songs that relate to science fiction topics or other any other topic "
"that was considered interesting or funny.  Some of the people who sing these "
"songs also write some.  Many of these songs put new words to existing tunes, "
"and such a song is called a &ldquo;filk&rdquo; of the original song.  Thus, "
"the free software song is a filk of <cite>Sadi Moma</cite>."
