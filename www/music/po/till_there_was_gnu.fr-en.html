<h2>'Till There Was GNU</h2>

<p><strong>A Song Performed By Steven R. Champagne</strong></p>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>there were applications<br />
but I never saw their source code<br />
no I never saw it at all<br />
'till there was gnu</p>

<p>there were profits so high<br />
it was all proprietary<br />
all behind a corporate wall<br />
'till there was gnu</p>

<p>then there were downloads<br />
and wonderful mail lists<br />
that informed me<br />
with sweet contributions<br />
from all, it's true</p>

<p>there was code all around<br />
but I never heard of sharing<br />
no I never heard it at all<br />
'till there was gnu</p>

<p>&lt;instruments&gt;</p>
