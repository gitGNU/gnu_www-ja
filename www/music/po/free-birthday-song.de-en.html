<h2>The Free Birthday Song</h2>

<p>This song was written by Steven Sheffey in celebration of Richard
Stallman's birthday.  It follows the same tune as the
<a href="/music/free-software-song.html">Free Software Song</a>: the Bulgarian
folk song &ldquo;Sadi moma bela loza.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="lyrics">

    <p>Happy birthday, Dr. Stallman<br />
    Set us free, Stallman, set us free<br />
    Happy birthday, Dr. Stallman<br />
    Set us free, Stallman, set us free.</p>

    <p>I used to use non-free software<br />
    Sadly true, Stallman, sadly true<br />
    But now I use software libre<br />
    Learned from you, Stallman, learned from you.</p>

    <p>Spread free software to the planet<br />
    We'll help too, Stallman, we'll help too<br />
    One day software will be libre<br />
    For the world, Stallman, shared with you.</p>

    <p>Happy birthday, Dr. Stallman<br />
    Set us free, Stallman, set us free<br />
    Happy birthday, Dr. Stallman<br />
    Set us free, Stallman, set us free.</p>
