"This song is in a rhythm of 7/8; those unaccustomed to odd rhythms often "
"take the unevenness to be a mistake. The meter can be analyzed into three "
"subgroups as slow-quick-quick or 3-2-2. Such meters in Bulgarian music can "
"often be stretched, and some musicians analyze this song as 3-2-3 instead; "
"however, Yves Moreau, who collected and taught the dance, endorses the "
"rhythm of 7."
