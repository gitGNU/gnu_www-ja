\begin{verse}

A hacker went a-coding armed with coffee and his brain \\
Debating in himself whether to put it all in 'main' \\
When all at once his IRC was filled with hateful spite \\ 
A plethora of angry words about syntax highlight \newline

Their hands were writing fire and they called each other n00b... \\
He'd never seen such sparking since the days of vacuum tubes \\
A bolt of fear went through him as he closed parentheses \\
Torn between the 'write and quit' and ol' C-x C-c \newline

Yippy kai yay... \\ 
File I/O... \\
Emacs versus vi... \newline

He'd long endured the arguments, he knew the story well... \\
So why condemn an editor and all its bytes to Hell? \\
From concepts of simplicity to a buffer-based OS... \\
You'd think they'd find a better way to work out daily stress! \newline

So learn your lesson, hacker, and you'll not regret one day... \\
The time you spent recovering, and throwing chars away... \\
What's popular is never what you'll get into your head... \\
So take a pointer from the pros... and choose the mighty ED! \newline

Yippy kai yay... \\
File I/O... \\
Emacs versus vi... \newline

Yippy kai yay... \\
File I/O... \\
Emacs versus vi... \newline
