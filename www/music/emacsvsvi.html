<h2>Emacs vs VI</h2>

<p><em>(To the tune of &ldquo;Ghost Riders in the Sky&rdquo;, by the Outlaws)</em></p>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>A hacker went a-coding armed with coffee and his brain<br />
Debating in himself whether to put it all in &#8217;main&#8217;<br />
When all at once his IRC was filled with hateful spite<br />
A plethora of angry words about syntax highlight </p>

<p>Their hands were writing fire and they called each other n00b&#8230;<br />
He&#8217;d never seen such sparking since the days of vacuum tubes<br />
A bolt of fear went through him as he closed parentheses<br />
Torn between the &#8217;write and quit&#8217; and ol&#8217; C-x C-c </p>

<p>Yippy kai yay&#8230;<br />
File I/O&#8230;<br />
Emacs versus vi&#8230; </p>

<p>He&#8217;d long endured the arguments, he knew the story well&#8230;<br />
So why condemn an editor and all its bytes to Hell?<br />
From concepts of simplicity to a buffer-based OS&#8230;<br />
You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d find a better way to work out daily stress!<br />
</p>

<p>So learn your lesson, hacker, and you&#8217;ll not regret one day&#8230; <br />
The time you spent recovering, and throwing chars away&#8230; <br />
What&#8217;s popular is never what you&#8217;ll get into your head&#8230; <br />
So take a pointer from the pros&#8230; and choose the mighty ED! </p>

<p>Yippy kai yay&#8230; <br />
File I/O&#8230; <br />
Emacs versus vi&#8230; </p>

<p>Yippy kai yay&#8230; <br />
File I/O&#8230; <br />
Emacs versus vi&#8230; </p>
