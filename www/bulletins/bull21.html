</p>

<h3 id="SEC5">What Is the FSF?</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced "guh-new") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</p>
<p>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have three specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and
distribute it to your friends and co-workers; second, the freedom to change
a program as you wish, by having full access to source code; third, the
freedom to distribute a modified version and thus help build the community.
Free software means you can study the source and learn how such programs
are written; it means you can port it or improve it, and then share your
work with others.

</p>
<p>
If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a distribution fee or you
may give it away, so long as you include the source code and the <i>GNU
General Public License</i>; see section <a href="#SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</a>, for details.

</p>
<p>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</p>
<p>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</p>
<p>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President;
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</p>
<h3 id="SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.
But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <em>all</em> users.  To prevent this,
<em>copyleft</em> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</p>
<p>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <em>GNU General Public License</em> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <em>GNU Library General
Public License</em> (LGPL), applies to a few (but not most) GNU libraries.
This license permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables
under certain conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU
source code distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available
upon request.

</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each
license.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC7">First Free Software Conference</h3>

<p>
In February, the FSF hosted the First Conference on Freely Redistributable
Software at the Cambridge (MA) Marriott.
The Conference drew 185 attendees from 14
countries, with Linus Torvalds and Richard
M. Stallman as the keynote speakers, eight tutorials, eleven
technical presentations, and a half dozen BoFs.

</p>
<p>
The Conference Proceedings have been published and are available from the
FSF while supplies last (see the FSF Order Form, in the centerfold).

</p>
<p>
The FSF is currently negotiating with groups in Europe and the U.S.
concerning co-sponsorship of future events.

</p>
<p>
The FSF thanks everyone who made this Conference a success,

<h3 id="SEC8">What Is the Hurd?</h3>

<p>
The Hurd is a collection of server processes that run on top of Mach, a
free message-passing microkernel developed at CMU.  The Hurd and Mach
together form the kernel of the GNU operating system.  The GNU C Library
implements the Unix "system call" interface by sending messages to
Hurd servers as appropriate.
</p><p>
The Hurd allows users to create and share useful projects without
knowing much about the internal workings of the system--projects that might
never have been attempted without freely available source, a well-designed
interface, and a multiple server design.  The Hurd is thus like other
expandable GNU software, e.g. Emacs and GUILE.

</p>

<p>
Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform
exists.  Right now we are using the University of Utah's Mach distribution
which we hope will be unified with the distribution produced by the Open
Software Foundation.

</p>
<p>
The first test version of the Hurd was just released.  See section <a href="#SEC11">GNUs Flashes</a>, for a report on recent progress.
</p><p>
We need help with significant Hurd-related projects.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should send mail
to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C
Library to new systems is another way to help.
</p><p>
You can get the Hurd from <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>, our FTP distribution
site, along with complete binaries for an i386 GNU system.  We will not be
distributing these things on CD-ROM until they are more stable.

</p>
<h3 id="SEC9">What Is a GNU/Linux system?</h3>

<p>
by Richard M. Stallman

</p>
<p>
A GNU/Linux system is a system which is a combination of Linux and
GNU.

</p>

<p>
Linux is a kernel, compatible with the Unix kernel, written by Linus
Torvalds.

</p>
<p>
GNU is a Unix-like operating system.  We started the GNU Project in 1984
with the aim of bringing such a system into existence.  A Unix-like
operating system consists of many components; we had to obtain each of the
important components somehow.  The job was so large that many of the people
who sympathized with the goal were discouraged from attempting it, but we
decided we would reach the goal no matter how long it took.

</p>
<p>
We found some components already available as free software--for
example, the X Window System and TeX.  Naturally we decided to use
them, since the job was big enough even with short cuts.  We obtained
other components by helping to convince their developers to make them
free--for example, the Berkeley network utilities.

</p>
<p>
The rest of components, we had to write.  These include GNU Emacs, the
GNU C &#38; C<tt>++</tt> compilers &#38; libraries, Bash, Ghostscript, Groff, &#38;
many others.

</p>
<p>
All of these various components--those we wrote, those we helped make
free, and those we found already available--together make up the GNU
system.

</p>
<p>
Until recently, users couldn't run <i>the</i> GNU system, because one part
(the kernel; see section <a href="#SEC8">What Is the Hurd?</a>) was not yet ready.  (We made
the first test release just recently.)  However, for a couple of years
now, it has been possible to put together the Linux kernel and the
almost-complete GNU system, resulting in a complete Unix-like free
operating system suitable for actual use.

</p>
<p>
While commonly referred to as "Linux systems", we prefer the term
"Linux-based GNU systems," or "GNU/Linux systems" for short, since
these systems are mostly the same as <em>the</em> GNU system.
This gives Linus credit for the kernel that he
wrote, while still indicating that these systems <em>as a whole</em> are
essentially variants of the GNU system.

</p>
<p>
We also occasionally use the term "GNU/Hurd system" to emphasize that
we mean a version of the GNU system which uses the Hurd rather than
Linux.

</p>
<p>
We think it is proper to give the GNU Project credit for making the free
Unix-like system that it set out for a decade ago.  But there is a more
important reason for friends of GNU to use names like "Linux-based GNU
system" instead of "Linux system."  This is to help spread the GNU
Project's philosophical idea: that there is ethical importance in
freeing users to share software and cooperate in improving it; that free
software belongs to a community, and people who benefit from the
community should feel a moral obligation to help build the community
when they have a chance.

</p>
<p>
When users install a system which they call "Linux," they can easily miss
ever seeing the GNU idea.  When businesses promote a system and call it
"Linux," they can easily avoid bringing the GNU idea to users' attention.
And if the GNU idea is not widely known, fewer people will write free
software.

</p>
<p>
A conference was recently announced on the topic of developing "Linux
applications"; although the conference is about using the GNU system, the
conference announcement did not mention GNU.

</p>
<p>
The announcement does not even hint that there is any ethical reason to
contribute to free software.  On the contrary, it offers a panel
entitled, "Licenses and licensing--I don't want to give away my
application!!!"  (The three `!' marks appear in the announcement).
Even the title encourages people writing new software (which
could enhance all free operating systems) to make it proprietary
instead, thus contributing nothing to the free software community.

</p>
<p>
It would be harder to express that attitude if everyone knew that the
topic is a variant of the GNU system.  It is up to you and us to make
sure they know.  To do that, we have to inform people using variant
GNU systems that that is what they are doing.

</p>
<p>
So please use the term "Linux-based GNU system" or "GNU/Linux"
when you talk about a system which is a combination of Linux and GNU.
At first, it may feel strange to go against the flow, but think how much
more "against the flow" it was to start writing a free operating system.
We did it, and you can do it.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC10">FSF and Debian Separate Amicably</h3>

<p>
Ian Murdock started the effort to put together Debian, a Linux-based
GNU system designed to be easy to install &#38; upgrade.  He asked for &#38;
got the FSF's sponsorship for the project, hoping that besides
being useful in its own right, it would give the FSF experience in
packaging up a complete GNU system.

</p>
<p>
This March, Murdock stepped down as the head of Debian, having become
too busy with other work.  The new team head did not want FSF
sponsorship.  As a result, the FSF is no longer a sponsor of Debian.
We wish the situation were otherwise.  However, we are working
together on some design issues.

</p>
<p>
We have not yet decided whether the FSF will distribute a CD-ROM of
Debian, since we don't know if that would achieve enough of the goals
that we previously hoped for as sponsors of the system.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC11">GNUs Flashes</h3>


<ul>

<li><b>Hurd Test Release!</b>   (Also see section <a href="#SEC8">What Is the Hurd?</a>)

We are pleased to announce the first public test release of the Hurd,
version 0.0; it is very preliminary, and we don't recommend you try it
unless you are in the mood to experiment.  We are distributing it only by
FTP until it becomes more stable.

Much work remains to be done on reliability, efficiency, and on user-level
features to take advantage of the underlying capabilities.  We're making
rapid progress on these tasks, and we plan to make further releases fairly
often.

</li><li><b>Preliminary GNU System Released!</b>

The first test release of the Hurd has enabled us to release a complete GNU
system in binary form, for 32-bit PC clones.  Like the Hurd itself, this
system release is preliminary, recommended for experimentation only, and
available only by FTP.  We have thus come in sight of the goal which the
GNU project was founded to achieve.  We will actually reach that goal when
the system becomes reliable enough that we can recommend it for real use.

</li><li><b>www.gnu.ai.mit.edu</b>

The GNU Project now has a site on the World Wide Web at URL:
<tt>`http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu'</tt>.  We would like to thank Networks
On-Line (URL: <tt>`http://www.nol.net'</tt>) for donating use of the
hardware &#38; Internet connection, and their staff for setting up the machine.
We would also like to thank Phil Nelson and Len Tower for being the
site's webmasters.  They are reachable at
<code>webmaster@www.gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>New Source Code CD!</b>   (See section <a href="#SEC34">July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs</a>)

We have released the July 1996 (Edition 8) Source Code CD-ROM.  Once again,
it is a two disk set.  It includes several new programs:
Automake,
<code>enscript</code>,
Exim,
<code>gcal</code>,
Generic NQS,
<code>geomview</code>,
GNAT,
GNUMATH,
ID Utils,
Inetutils,
Karma,
Lynx,
Maxima,
Miscfiles,
Smail,
TIFF,
and
WN.
See section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>, for more information about these packages.
Also on the CD-ROMs are full distributions of X11R6.1, MIT Scheme, Emacs,
GCC, and current versions of all other GNU Software.

</li><li><b>GNU Miscellaneous Files Distribution</b>

We have just released the GNU Miscellaneous Files Distribution, which is a
collection of non-crucial but useful files.
All the files in version 1.0 have come from BSD, but files from other
sources are eagerly solicited.  Please send bug reports, as well as
suggestions about new files to include to
<code>bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  See the entry in section <a href="#SEC23">GNU Software Now Available</a>, for more information.

</li><li><b>Free Java for Linux Machines on the way!</b>

Eric S. Raymond maintains a Linux "HOWTO" for running Java on Linux
machines, including information about freely available Java software.  See
<tt>`http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Java-HOWTO.html'</tt> for
information.

</li><li><b>Give to GNU the United Way!</b>

As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, the FSF is eligible to receive United
Way funds.  When donating to United Way, one can specify that all or part
of the donation be directed to the FSF.  On the donor form, check the
"Specific Requests" box and include the sentence, "Send my gift to the
Free Software Foundation, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110."

</li><li><b>Tapes and MS-DOS Diskettes No Longer Available from the FSF</b>

We no longer offer tapes or MS-DOS diskettes due to very low demand.

</li><li><b>GNU Software Works on MS-DOS</b>   (Also see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS for
i386/i486/Pentium machines.
We ship binaries &#38; sources on
the section <a href="#SEC31">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.
We will ship binaries &#38; sources on the section <a href="#SEC32">MS-DOS/Windows Book with CD-ROM</a>, when
it is available.

</li><li><b>California's Department of Water Resources to use GNU GPL</b>

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) of the State of California plans to
use the GNU General Public License to protect a numerical model, the
"Delta Simulation Model 2" (DSM2), which is used to calculate flows,
water quality, and particle movement in a tidal estuary.

The DWR says that they wish to ensure that `DSM2 remain freely available to
all who wish to use and modify the code for the benefit of the entire
estuary community.  The GPL is considered to be a practical way to achieve
this goal.'

</li><li><b>New Free Postscript Fonts Available!</b>

A commercial font supplier (URW++, of Hamburg, Germany) has released a
commercial-quality set of the 35 standard Postscript Type 1 scalable fonts
with the GPL.
These sets include equivalents of the following type faces:

	<em>Serif:</em>
		Bookman, New Century Schoolbook,
		  Palatino, Times;
	<em>Sans-serif:</em>
		Avant Garde, Helvetica, Helvetica Narrow;
	<em>Serif, monospace:</em>
		Courier;
        <em>Script:</em> Zapf Chancery; and
	<em>Symbolic:</em>
		Symbol, Zapf Dingbats.
All but the symbolic fonts are available in plain, bold, italic (or
oblique), and bold italic (or bold oblique) variants.  The fonts are
available in .PFB format (a standard Type 1 binary format originally used
on PCs); the metrics are available in .AFM and .PFM formats for use by
desktop publishing applications.

The fonts are included in the most recent release of GNU Ghostscript, and
are also available packaged separately.  They replace the lower quality
fonts previously released with Ghostscript.

</li><li><b>MULE Merge Almost Complete</b>

MULE is the Multi-Lingual Emacs developed by Ken'ichi Handa at the
Electro-Technical Lab in Tsukuba, Japan.  Handa has readied the code
for merging into Emacs and we expect to complete the merge soon.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs 19.32</b>   (Also see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)
<p>
We have just released Emacs 19.32.  It mostly fixes bugs, but it has a few
new features.  The most noticeable one is that marking a region with the
mouse now leaves the region highlighted at least until the next input
event.  Also, a new timer system lets you efficiently arrange to call a
Lisp function at a particular time, and mouse tracking is much faster and
more reliable.
</p><p>
Support for MS-DOS and Windows 95 is greatly improved.  You can now
compile Emacs with DJGPP version 2; asynchronous subprocesses now
work on Windows 95; and many additional Lisp packages now work
on MS-DOS.
</p>
</li><li><b>Utah Flux Project Software</b>

<b>Fluke</b>, to be the base of the Flux OS, is a new "nanokernel."  Design
documentation, API documentation, &#38; an experimental prototype are
available.  See the Web site or write to
<code>fluke-interest-request@cs.utah.edu</code>.

<h3 id="SEC12">Free Software Redistributors Donate</h3>

<p>
The <b>SNOW 2.1 CD</b> producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to the
FSF" to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how
much of the price is for the FSF &#38; how much is for the redistributor.
</p><p>
The <b>Sun Users Group Deutschland</b> has made it even clearer:
their CD says, "Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the FSF."
</p><p>
<b>ASCII Corporation</b> (Japan) has also donated to the FSF
and plans to add a donation to the price of their next GNU software CD-ROM.
</p><p>
<b>Austin</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Works</b>, a free software redistributor,
supports free software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling
price for the GNU software CDs they produce &#38; sell.
</p><p>
<b>TOHDO-SHA</b> is donating 400 yen to the FSF for each copy of
<cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, Japanese Edition</cite>
sold at bookstores in Japan.
</p><p>
<b>CQ Publishing</b> made a large donation from the sales of their GAWK
book in Japanese, and <b>Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc.</b> is
donating 3% of the profits from selling "Effective AWK Programming", by
Arnold Robbins.
<b>Walnut</b> <b>Creek</b> <b>CDROM</b> gives us part of
their selling price every month.

</p>
<p>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.
</p><p>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</p>
<p>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</p>
<p>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated,"
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</p>
<p>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler or Mach contribute more; major new features &#38; programs
contribute the most.

</p>
<p>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC13">Help from Free Software Companies</h3>

<p>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) regularly donates a part of its
income to the FSF to support the development of new GNU programs.  Listing
them here is our way of thanking them.
Wingnut has made a pledge to donate 10% of their income to the FSF, and has
purchased several Deluxe Distribution packages in Japan.  Also see

<h3 id="SEC14">Some Bad News about Pine</h3>

<p>
Pine is a simple electronic mail reader for beginning users, which we have
included on our Source CDs since 1995.

</p>
<p>
In March of 1996, the Pine developers released a new version with new usage
restrictions.  The new terms do not permit everyone to redistribute, and do
not permit distribution of modified versions at all.  Either restriction
would be enough to prevent Pine from being free software.

</p>
<p>
The previous versions of Pine remain free; however, no substantial
program is bug-free, and every program needs to be maintained.  So
this April the Free Software Foundation recruited a team of volunteers
to carry on development of the free version of Pine, starting from the
last available free release (3.91).

</p>
<p>
Forking a program is unfortunate; people should try their best to work
together before giving up and working separately.  So before embarking
on separate development, we tried our best to persuade the old
developers to make their work free software once again.  In the end,
though, they rejected our plea.

</p>
<p>
The new team has just started, and has yet to do a release.  However, you
can report bugs in Pine 3.91 to them at the address
<code>bug-pine@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>, so they can be fixed in the next
release of the free alternative version of Pine.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC15">Free Software Support</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our
mission is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way
to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers do now; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

</p>
<p>
The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support and other
consulting services.  It is
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE'</tt> on a GNU FTP host (listed in section <a href="#SEC39">How to Get GNU Software</a>),
on the World Wide Web

<p>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part
of preparing a new improved version.  We may send you a patch for a bug so
that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug
report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from
another user who reads our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the

<h3 id="SEC16">What Is the LPF?</h3>

<p>
The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) aims to protect the freedom to
write software.  This freedom is threatened by "look-and-feel" interface
copyright lawsuits and by software patents.

</p>
<p>
The League is a grass-roots organization of professors, students, business
people, programmers, users, &#38; even software companies dedicated to
bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League isn't opposed to
the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on individual programs.
The League aims to reverse recent changes made by judges in response to
special interests.

</p>
<p>
Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers, managers,
and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.
</p><p>
To join, please send a check and the following information:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

Your name and phone numbers (home, work, or both).

</li><li>

The address to use for League mailings, a few each year (please indicate
whether it is your home address or your work address).

</li><li>

The company you work for, and your position.

</li><li>

Your email address, so the League can contact you for political action.
(If you don't want to be contacted for this, please say so, but please
provide your email address anyway.)

</li><li>

Please mention anything about you which would enable your<br />
endorsement of the League to impress the public.

</li><li>

Please say whether you would like to help with League activities.

</li></ul>

<p>
<strong>The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation, and
is not concerned with the issue of free software.</strong>  The FSF supports the
League
because, like any software developer smaller than Microsoft, it is
endangered by
software patents and interface copyrights.  You are in danger, too!  It
would be easy to ignore the problem until you or your employer is sued, but
it is more prudent to organize before that happens.

<h3 id="SEC17">News from the LPF</h3>

<p>
by Dean Anderson, President, League for Programming Freedom

</p>
<p>
<b>Statement on Supreme Court Decision</b>

</p>
<p>
The recent Supreme Court action in <cite>Lotus v. Borland</cite> represents a
victory for Borland, the League, developers, and users.  While we wish the
Supreme Court was more specific and had provided a written opinion, the
Supreme Court tie allows the First Circuit decision to stand as law for the
First Circuit, and as an "authoritative reference" for other Circuits.
Essentially, the action means that one cannot own the user interface to
programs.

</p>
<p>
This action is a win for users because their investment in learning a user
interface can be preserved when they change vendors.  It will be more
difficult to create software monopolies based on claiming an exclusive
right to a user interface.  This decision will promote competition in the
software industry as software companies will now compete to provide better
and cheaper software which speaks the languages that users already know.

</p>

<p>
The League can now focus its attention on the software patent problem.
Software patents are now
the major threat to software developers, and to users and the general
public as prices are driven up by legal and licensing costs.  Software
innovations which would improve our quality of life may be blocked by
patent disputes and licensing quagmires.  As people become more dependent
on computer networks and software, the software patent issue will become
more critical.

</p>
<p>
<b>Tell a Friend about the LPF</b>

</p>
<p>
The user interface copyright battle was largely fought in the courtroom,
and that involved some key moments of focus and coordination.  But since we
will probably be battling in Congress over software patents, our approach will
have to be somewhat different.  Therefore, it is very important to get more
members.  Membership is what will get us the most clout with Congress.  In
the next year, we will need to gear up to promote our ideas more widely,
both inside &#38; outside of the software world.  Your help &#38; support is very
important to the success of this effort, so encourage everyone you know to
join the LPF!

</p>
<p>
Keep writing letters!  Write the LPF, your representatives, newspapers,
journals, and others.  Be sure to send us copies of the articles you wrote, and
the publications to which they were sent.
See our Web page at <tt>`http://www.lpf.org/'</tt> for more info on how to

<h3 id="SEC18">Help the GNU Translation Project</h3>

<p>
GNU is going international!  Our Translation Project gets
users, translators, and maintainers together, so GNU will gradually
speak many native languages.

</p>
<p>
To complete the GNU Translation Project, we need many people who
like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to
synergize with other translators speaking the same language as part of
"translation teams".
</p><p>
If you want to start a new team, or want more information on existing teams
or other aspects of this project, write

Many groups in Japan now distribute GNU software.  They include JUG, a PC
user group; ASCII, a periodical and book publisher; the Fujitsu FM
Towns users group; and SRA's special GNU users' support group, Wingnut, who
also purchased the first Deluxe Distribution package in Japan
(also see section <a href="#SEC13">Help from Free Software Companies</a>).  (Since
then, there have been several other purchases of Deluxe Distribution
packages in Japan.)

</p>
<p>
It is easy to place an order directly with the FSF from Japan, thus funding
new software.  To get an FSF Order Form written in Japanese, ask
<code>japan-fsf-orders@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.
We encourage you to buy our software CDs:
for example, 140 CD-ROM orders at the
corporate rate allow the FSF to hire a programmer for a year to write more
free software.

<p>
Many programs in the field of parallel processing and knowledge processing
were released to the public under the name of "ICOT Free Software (IFS)"
in the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project.  IFS was an 11-year
Japanese project started in 1982 and FGCS was its 2-year follow-on project.

</p>
<p>
As of the end of March 1996, over 3,900 persons have accessed the ICOT Web
page, and almost 21,000 files have been transferred since the first release
in 1992.  As ICOT was wound up in June, 1995, maintenance and further
development of IFS was transferred to the Japan Information Processing
Development Center (JIPDEC).  JIPDEC established the Research Institute for
Advanced Information Technology (AITEC).  AITEC not only maintains,
develops, and distributes IFS, but also develops parallel knowledge
processing software in collaboration with several Japanese universities.
Newly developed software will be released to the public with conditions
similar to those of IFS.
</p><p>
For now, the domain name will remain <code>icot.or.jp</code>.  For more

<h3 id="SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</h3>

<p>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</p>

<ul>

<li><b>GNU C Library</b>   (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

Version 2.0 of the GNU C library is now in test release.  GNU/Hurd support
is now fully functional.  Roland McGrath and Ulrich Drepper have been
working steadily on support for GNU/Linux; the new GNU C library will
eventually be the new standard system C library on GNU/Linux,
<tt>`libc.so.6'</tt>.  David Mosberger-Tang and Richard Henderson have
contributed Alpha and 64-bit ELF support along with many fixes and
improvements; the next major release of Linux/Alpha will use the GNU C
library as the sole system library.  Andreas Schwab has contributed
Linux/m68k support.

This release adds several new functions traditionally found in Unix systems
&#38; some small new GNU extensions, as well as major new internationalization
support.  Ulrich Drepper has made invaluable contributions to the library
in recent months, including new floating-point printing/reading functions
that are perfectly accurate &#38; much faster than the old code; an
<tt>`nsswitch.conf'</tt> mechanism for versatile name database lookup, paving
the way for easy plug-in support of protocols like NIS; and a complete set
of internationalization features including POSIX.2-compatible <code>locale</code>
&#38; <code>localedef</code> programs, &#38; catalogs for displaying program messages in
languages other than English.  (Ulrich presented a paper on his
internationalization work at the section <a href="#SEC7">First Free Software Conference</a>; to order a copy of the Proceedings, see the FSF
Order Form, in the centerfold).

The library now builds as a shared library for systems that use the ELF
object file format.  Included is the run-time loader (<code>ld.so</code>) which
sets up the shared libraries when a program runs; it works now with the
Hurd &#38; Linux kernels, and is easy to port to other ELF systems such as SVR4
&#38; Solaris 2.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>   (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

Future versions of Emacs will: save the undo history in a file (which allows
you to undo older changes in the history) and also have support for
variable-width fonts, wide character sets, and the world's major languages.
Our long term plan is to move it in the direction of a WYSIWYG word
processor &#38; make it easier for beginners to use.

</li><li><b>GNUstep</b>   (Also see "Objective-C Library" in section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement over two years ago, there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, named GNUstep.  Work has begun on GNUstep, starting with a
library written in Objective-C.  Much remains to be done to bring this
library close to the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should contact
<code>office@gnustep.org</code>.  Check <tt>`http://www.gnustep.org/'</tt>
for more info.

</li><li><code>recode</code>    (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

The next <code>recode</code> release should give more flexible control over
encodings of charsets, offer MIME conversions, &#38; handle ISO-10646
(Unicode).  It will install a library &#38; support files to help work towards
internationalizing GNU.

</li><li><p><b>GUILE</b>

GNU's Ubiquitous Extension Language is an SCM-based library which
can be used to make any ordinary C program extensible
(for SCM info, see "JACAL" in section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>).
</p><p>
Also being developed are a POSIX.1 interface, an SCSH-like library, a
module system, a Tk interface, &#38; a byte-code interpreter; support for Emacs
Lisp &#38; a more C-like language is coming.
</p>

</li><li><code>ptx</code>   (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

The next release of <code>ptx</code> should offer contextualized support for SGML
texts as the first step towards a major overhaul for that package.

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>   (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

Version 2.2 of GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was released in November '95.  It now
includes a graphical interface to the Tk widget system.  All documentation
is now Texinfo-based, with built-in regexp matching used to access the
documentation.  A first pass at the Common Lisp condition system is also
included.  Some new ports include DEC Alpha
and ELF for GNU/Linux.  Volunteers to help with the move to the ANSI standard
are most welcome; contact <code>schelter@math.utexas.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>C Interpreter</b>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
task is partly finished.  GCC has generated byte code for all supported
languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
finish this work has begun.  To make this work usable, we need to enhance
GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We would also like support for
compiling just a few selected functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GCC</b>   (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

New front ends for GCC are being developed for Pascal and Chill.
See the Fortran item in this article for news on that front end.
See the GNAT item in section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>, for news on GNU Ada.

</li><li><b>Fortran</b>   (For info on <code>f2c</code> &#38; GCC, see section <a href="#SEC21">GNU Software</a>)

The GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) front end is stable, but more work is needed
to bring its overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the
levels the Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: improving
documentation and diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially for
large, densely initialized data tables; completing existing support for
<code>INTEGER*2</code>, <code>INTEGER*8</code>, and similar features; allowing
intrinsics in <code>PARAMETER</code> statements; and providing debug information

<h3 id="SEC21">GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All our software is available via
FTP; see section <a href="#SEC39">How to Get GNU Software</a>.  We also offer
section <a href="#SEC26">CD-ROMs</a>, and printed
section <a href="#SEC38">GNU Documentation</a>,
which includes manuals and reference cards.
In the articles describing the contents of each medium, the version number
listed after each program name was current when we published this Bulletin.
When you order a newer CD-ROM, some of the programs may be newer and
therefore the version number higher.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
for ordering information.

</p>
<p>
Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <code>compress</code>, we use another compression program,
<code>gzip</code>.  (Such prohibitions on software development are fought by the
League for Programming Freedom; see section <a href="#SEC16">What Is the LPF?</a>, for details.)

</p>
<p>
You may need to build GNU <code>make</code> before you build our other software.
Some vendors
supply no <code>make</code> utility at all and some native <code>make</code> programs
lack the <code>VPATH</code> feature essential for using the GNU configure system
to its full extent.  The GNU <code>make</code> sources have a shell script to
build <code>make</code> itself on such systems.

</p>
<p>
We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (see section <a href="#SEC15">Free Software Support</a>).

</p>

<h4 id="SEC22">Configuring GNU Software</h4>

<p>
We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software
packages in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below,
in this article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same
alternatives for naming machine and system types.
</p><p>
Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system
all at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package
separately.
</p><p>
You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.
Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

<ul>

<li><code>acm</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>acm</code> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

</li><li><b>Apache</b>   (SrcCD)

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for version 1.3
or 1.4 of the NCSA server.  It fixes many bugs in the NCSA server,
includes many frequently requested new features, and has an API which
allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily.

</li><li><b>Autoconf</b>   (SrcCD)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <code>m4</code> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <code>m4</code> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

</li><li><b>Automake</b>   (SrcCD)

Automake is a tool for generating `Makefile.in's for use with Autoconf.
The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile standards.

</li><li><b>BASH</b>   (SrcCD)

GNU's shell, BASH (<b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell), is compatible with the
Unix <code>sh</code> and offers many extensions found in <code>csh</code> and
<code>ksh</code>.  BASH has job control, <code>csh</code>-style command history,
command-line editing (with Emacs and <code>vi</code> modes built-in), and the
ability to rebind keys via the <code>readline</code> library.  BASH conforms to the
POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

</li><li><code>bc</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>bc</code> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <code>bc</code> follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992
standard with several extensions, including multi-character variable names,
an <code>else</code> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <code>dc</code> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <code>bc</code> is not implemented as a <code>dc</code> preprocessor.

</li><li><p><b>BFD</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

The <b>B</b>inary <b>F</b>ile <b>D</b>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <code>ld</code> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet
published on paper).
</p><p>
At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.
</p>
</li><li><b>Binutils</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

Binutils includes these programs:
<code>ar</code>,
<code>c<tt>++</tt>filt</code>,
<code>demangle</code>,
<code>gas</code>,
<code>gprof</code>,
<code>ld</code>,
<code>nlmconv</code>,
<code>nm</code>,
<code>objcopy</code>,
<code>objdump</code>,
<code>ranlib</code>,
<code>size</code>,
<code>strings</code>,
&#38;
<code>strip</code>.

Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, <code>gas</code>,
supports the a29k, Alpha, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS,
NS32K, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and attempts to be compatible
with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It can produce
mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility similar to
that in some other assemblers.  GNU's linker, <code>ld</code>, emits source-line
numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined
references, and interprets a superset of AT&#38;T's Linker Command Language,
which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
<code>nlmconv</code> converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
<code>objdump</code> can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and
can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format
read by BFD.

</li><li><p><b>Bison</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<code>yacc</code>.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Bison Manual</cite>
and reference card are included; see section <a href="#SEC38">GNU Documentation</a>.
</p><p>
A recent policy change allows non-free programs to use Bison-generated
parsers.
</p>
</li><li><b>C Library</b>   <em>See section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a></em>

  (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman]</b>

The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most of the
functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible with 4.4BSD and
includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <code>malloc</code>
which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU
regular-expression functions (<code>regex</code> and <code>rx</code>) now nearly
conform to the POSIX 1003.2 standard.

GNU <code>stdio</code> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <code>fmemopen</code> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <code>printf</code> formats to use a C function you have written.  For
example, you can safely use format strings from user input to implement
a <code>printf</code>-like function for another programming language.
Extended <code>getopt</code> functions are already used to parse options,
including long options, in many GNU utilities.
Texinfo source for the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> is
included (see section <a href="#SEC38">GNU Documentation</a>).

It runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2), HP
9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation (Ultrix
4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486/Pentium (GNU/Hurd, GNU/Linux, System V,
SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2, &#38; SCO ODT 2.0),
Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3), &#38; SGI (Irix 4).

</li><li><p><b>C<tt>++</tt> Library</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

The GNU C<tt>++</tt> library (libg<tt>++</tt>) contains an extensive collection of
container and utility classes, including Obstacks, multiple-precision
Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers, BitSets, and BitStrings.
</p><p>
The distribution also includes the libstdc<tt>++</tt> library.  This implements
library facilities defined by the forthcoming ANSI/ISO C<tt>++</tt> standard,
including strings, the iostream library, and a port of the Standard
Template Library.
</p>
</li><li><b>Calc</b>   (SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator &#38; mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
can use Calc as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many
more features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
logarithmic, trigonometric, &#38; financial functions; arbitrary precision;
complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
algebraic simplification; &#38; differentiation &#38; integration.  It outputs to
<code>gnuplot</code>, &#38; comes with source for a manual &#38; reference card
(see section <a href="#SEC38">GNU Documentation</a>).

</li><li><code>cfengine</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>cfengine</code> is used to maintain site-wide configuration of a
heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
appearance is similar to <code>rdist</code>, but allows many more operations
to be performed automatically.

</li><li><b>CLISP</b>   (SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
It mostly supports the Lisp described by <cite>Common LISP: The Language
(2nd edition)</cite> and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a foreign language
interface, and, for some machines, a screen editor.  The user interface
language (English, German, French) can be chosen at run time.  Major
packages that run in CLISP include CLX &#38; Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB of
memory &#38; runs on many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2,
Windows NT, Amiga 500--4000, and Acorn RISC PC) &#38; Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux,
Sun4, SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTStep, &#38; others).

</li><li><b>Common Lisp</b>   <em>Also see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a></em>   (SrcCD)
<p>
GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
&#38; interpreter for Common Lisp.
GCL is very portable &#38; extremely
efficient on a wide class of applications, &#38; compares favorably in
performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover &#38;
symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.
</p><p>
GCL compiles to C &#38; then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args &#38; one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in
registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted
code &#38; displays source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler
(based on the C profiling tools) counts function calls &#38; the time spent in
each function.
</p><p>
There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs
in a separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp
computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
interface.
</p><p>
There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
does PCL (see
"PCL" later in this article).
</p><p>
GCL version 2.2 is released under the GNU Library General Public
License.
</p>
</li><li><b>CLX</b>   (SrcCD)

CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.
This is separate from the built-in TK interface.

</li><li><code>cpio</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>cpio</code> is an archive program with all the features of SVR4
<code>cpio</code>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite>
standard.  <code>mt</code>, a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
<code>cpio</code>.

</li><li><b>CVS</b>   (SrcCD)

CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows you to
keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who,
when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles multiple developers,
multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations,
and can work over a wide area network.  It does not handle build
management or bug-tracking; these are handled by <code>make</code> and GNATS,
respectively.

</li><li><b>DejaGnu</b>   (SrcCD)
<p>
DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all
tests.  DejaGnu's flexibility &#38; consistency makes it easy to write
tests.
</p><p>
DejaGnu comes with <code>expect</code>, which runs scripts to conduct dialogs
with programs.
</p>
</li><li><b>Diffutils</b>   (SrcCD)

GNU <code>diff</code> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
Diffutils package contains <code>diff</code>, <code>diff3</code>, <code>sdiff</code>, &#38;
<code>cmp</code>.
Recent improvements include more consistent handling of character sets and
a new <code>diff</code> option to do all input/output in binary; this is useful
on some non-POSIX hosts.  Plans for the Diffutils package include support
for internationalization (e.g., error messages in Chinese) and for some
non-Unix PC environments.

</li><li><b>DJGPP</b>   (BinCD)
<p>
DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G<tt>++</tt> (see "GCC" in this article)
to i386s running MS-DOS.  DJGPP has a 32-bit
i386 DOS extender with a symbolic debugger, development libraries, &#38; ports
of Bison, <code>flex</code>, &#38; Binutils.  Full source code is provided.
It needs at least 5MB of hard disk space to install &#38; 512K
of RAM to use.
It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768),
XMS &#38; VDISK memory allocation,
<code>himem.sys</code>,
VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, &#38; 386MAX), &#38;
DPMI (e.g., Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, &#38; QDPMI).
DJGPP Version 2 was released in Feb 1996, &#38; needs a DPMI
environment; a free DPMI server is included.

is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated
into the editor--for writing extensions &#38; provides an interface to the
X Window System.  It runs on Unix, MS-DOS, &#38; Windows NT or 95.  In addition to
its powerful native command set, Emacs can emulate the
editors vi &#38; EDT (Digital's VMS editor).  Emacs has many other features which
make it a full computing support environment.  Source for

</li><li><code>es</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>es</code> is an extensible shell (based on <code>rc</code>) with first-class
functions, lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e.,
functions can return values other than just numbers).  <code>es</code>'s
extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the shell's
built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.  Like <code>rc</code>,
it is great for both interactive use and scripting, particularly since
its quoting rules are much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

</li><li><b>GCC</b>   <em>Also see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a></em>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman]</b>

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C<tt>++</tt>, and
Objective-C; the source
file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.
Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <code>object</code>, but see "GNUstep" in
section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>).
As much as possible,
G<tt>++</tt> is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not
with <code>cfront</code> (AT&#38;T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs automatic register
allocation, common sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain
amount of CSE between basic blocks -- though not all the supported machine
descriptions provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion
from loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
elimination, integration of inline functions &#38; frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf function
optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, the ability to assign
attributes to instructions, &#38; many local optimizations automatically deduced
from the machine description.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <code>long long
int</code>).  It supports extended floating point (type <code>long double</code>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional
C, &#38; GNU C extensions (including: nested functions support, nonlocal gotos,
&#38; taking the address of a label).

GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, &#38; DWARF.

GCC generates code for many CPUs, including the
a29k,
Alpha,
ARM,
AT&#38;T,
DSP1610,
Clipper,
Convex cN,
Elxsi,
Fujitsu Gmicro,

Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
easy as building a native compiler.

Version 1 of GCC, G<tt>++</tt>, &#38; libg<tt>++</tt> are no longer maintained.

is included with GCC (see section <a href="#SEC38">GNU Documentation</a>).

</li><li><b>GDB</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

GDB, the <b>G</b>NU <b>D</b>e<b>B</b>ugger, is a source-level debugger for C,
C<tt>++</tt>, and Fortran.

GDB can debug both C and C<tt>++</tt> programs, and will work with executables
produced by many different compilers; however, C<tt>++</tt> debugging will have
some limitations if you do not use GCC.

GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
interface.  Two X interfaces (not distributed or maintained by the FSF)
are: <code>gdbtk</code> (FTP it from <code>ftp.cygnus.com</code> in directory
<tt>`/pub/gdb'</tt>); and <code>xxgdb</code> (FTP it from <code>ftp.x.org</code> in
directory <tt>`/contrib/utilities'</tt>).

Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
(breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
has simulators for the
ARM,
Hitachi H8/300,
Hitachi H8/500,
Hitachi Super-H,
PowerPC,
WDC 65816,
&#38;
Zilog Z8001/2.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <em>targets</em> a platform
means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB can
<em>host</em> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
necessarily debug native programs.
<p>

multiple independently controllable objects and cameras.
<code>geomview</code> provides interactive control for motion, appearances
(including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an object, edge
or vertex level, and snapshots in SGI image file or Renderman RIB format.
Adding or deleting objects is provided through direct mouse
manipulation, control panels, and keyboard shortcuts.  External programs
can drive desired aspects of the viewer (such as continually loading
changing geometry or controlling the motion of certain objects) while
allowing interactive control of everything else.

</li><li><p><b>Ghostscript</b>   <em>Also see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a></em>   (SrcCD)

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript and PDF graphics languages.
</p><p>
The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 3.33.  This version includes
nearly a full Postscript Level 2 interpreter and also a PDF 1.0
interpreter.  Significant new features include: support for anti-aliased
characters; the ability to scan a directory and register all the fonts in
it; support for Type 0 (Japanese / Chinese / Korean) fonts; and the ability
to compile all the external initialization files into the executable.  This
version can also run as a 32-bit MS Windows application.

Thanks to the generosity of URW++ (Hamburg, Germany), the low-quality
bitmap-derived fonts distributed with older versions have been replaced
with commercial-quality, hinted outline fonts.  See section <a href="#SEC11">GNUs Flashes</a>.

Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language by writing
directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to files for
printing later or manipulating with other graphics programs.
</p><p>
Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
i386/i486/Pentiums running DOS with EGA, VGA or SuperVGA graphics (but
please do <em>not</em> ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not
use DOS).

<h3 id="SEC25">The Deluxe Distribution</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code
and includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, &#38; reference
cards.

</p>
<p>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C<tt>++</tt> Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</p>
<p>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine close to us.  However, we
can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system -- porting is a separate matter (to commission a port,
consult the GNU Service Directory; details in section <a href="#SEC15">Free Software Support</a>).
Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an
unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for a common machine.
Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

</p>
<p>
We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with
"Rock Ridge" extensions),
or on one of these tapes in Unix <code>tar</code> format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -- QIC24,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in c.t. -- QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm c.t., or
DAT 4mm c.t.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</p>
<p>
The manuals included are one each of the <cite>Bison</cite>, <cite>Calc</cite>,
<cite>GAWK</cite>, <cite>GNU C Compiler</cite>, <cite>GNU C Library</cite>, <cite>GDB</cite>,
<cite>Flex</cite>, <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</cite>, <cite>Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction</cite>, <cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Texinfo</cite>, &#38; <cite>Termcap</cite>
manuals; six copies of the <cite>GNU Emacs</cite> manual; and ten reference cards
each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB.
</p><p>
Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs
that have sources of our software &#38; compiler tool
binaries for some systems.
The
CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</p>
<p>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"
section on the
see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>
and send it to:

<h3 id="SEC26">CD-ROMs</h3>

<p>
We offer these CD-ROMs:

</p>

<ul>

<li>Several editions of our section <a href="#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>.

</li><li>December 1995 section <a href="#SEC31">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</li><li>December 1993 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</li></ul>

<p>
Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format and can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each
CD with "Rock Ridge" extensions
and it will look just like an ordinary Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated and otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</p>
<p>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC27">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the July 1996 Source CD
set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out of
your own pocket.  The December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

</p>

<h5 id="SEC28">What Do the Different Prices Mean?</h5>

<p>
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</p>
<p>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the July 1996 Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.

</p>
<p>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</p>
<p>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
140 Source CDs at that price support an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

</p>
<h5 id="SEC29">Why Is There an Individual Price?</h5>

<p>
In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

</p>
<p>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</p>
<h5 id="SEC30">Is There a Maximum Price?</h5>

<p>
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will
accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a
tax-exempt public charity.

</p>
<h4 id="SEC31">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We have the third edition of our CD-ROM that has binaries and complete
sources for GNU compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler.
This enables the people who use these systems to compile GNU and other free
software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.  You can also use
these GNU tools to compile your own C/C<tt>++</tt>/Objective-C programs.
Older editions of this CD are available while supplies last at a reduced
price; see the
see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

</p>

<p>

until we announce it on our electronic mailing lists (to subscribe, ask
<code>info-gnu-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>).

</p>

<h4 id="SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:

</p>

<ul>

<li>section <a href="#SEC34">July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs</a>, the newest release, has

programs, bug fixes, &#38; improvements not on the other CDs.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC35">December 1995 Source Code CD-ROMs</a>.

</li><li>June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM, see the

see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</li><li>May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM, see the

see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</li><li>October 1992 Source Code CD-ROM, see the

see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</li></ul>

<p>
The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced price
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in
section <a href="#SEC38">GNU Documentation</a>.
</p><p>
MIT Scheme &#38; much of X11 is <em>not</em> on the older Source CDs.

</p>
<p>
There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the section <a href="#SEC31">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</p>

<h5 id="SEC34">July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs</h5>

<h3 id="SEC37">CD-ROM Subscription Service</h3>

<p>
Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source CD-ROMs (plus
shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new versions of the
section <a href="#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>.  The CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued
(currently twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent).
We do not yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler
Tools Binaries CD or our DOS/Windows Book with CD-ROM when it is available.

</p>
<p>
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the
X Window System.  Each edition of the section <a href="#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>, has
updated sources for the X Window System.

</p>
<p>
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're
in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you
must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping
Costs" on the
see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="SEC38">GNU Documentation</h3>

<p>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online &#38; printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how to
use all the features of each program, &#38; give examples of command use.  GNU
manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both typeset
hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online hypertext
display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals comes
with our software; here are the manuals that we publish as printed books.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
to order them.

</p>
<p>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <em>lay-flat</em>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.  Currently, the <cite>GDB</cite>, <cite>Emacs</cite>, <cite>Emacs Lisp
Reference</cite>, <cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite>, <cite>GNU
Awk User's Guide</cite>,
<cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Bison</cite>, &#38; <cite>Texinfo</cite> manuals have this binding.  The
other GNU manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC binding.  All our
manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in by 11in
<cite>Calc</cite> manual.

</p>
<p>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</p>

<p>
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> (Edition 4.12 for Version 4.14) tells how to run
your program under GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a
program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GNU Emacs Manual</cite> (11th Edition for Version 19.32) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and
regular expression search; how to use special programming modes to write
languages like C<tt>++</tt> and TeX;
how to use the <code>tags</code> utility;
how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and
other elementary customizations.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite> (Edition 1.04) is for
people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do want
to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you read it in
Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

</p>
<p>
<cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.32)
and <cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition</cite> (Japanese DRAFT
Revision 1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
cover this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</p>
<p>
<cite>The GNU Awk User's Guide</cite> (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0.0) tells how
to use GAWK.  It is written for those who have never used <code>awk</code> and
describes features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.

</p>
<p>
<cite>GNU Make</cite> (Edition 0.50 for Version 3.75 Beta) describes GNU
<code>make</code>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <em>makefiles</em>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Flex</cite> manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <code>flex</code> program to create a
C<tt>++</tt> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</p>

<p>
<cite>The Bison Manual</cite> (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<tt>++</tt>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Texinfo</cite> manual (Edition 2.20 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation &#38; typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, &#38; how to catch mistakes.  This second edition
describes over 50 new commands.

</p>
<p>
<cite>The Termcap Manual</cite> (3nd Edition for Version 1.3), often
described as "twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap,"
details the format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal
capabilities, and the process of interrogating a terminal description.
This manual is primarily for programmers.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>C Library Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 0.07 for Version 1.09)
describes the library's facilities, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" &#38; "system calls."  We are doing small copier runs
of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to
<code>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Calc Manual</cite> (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC39">How to Get GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All the software &#38; publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can also get GNU software directly from the FSF by ordering
CD-ROMs and books.  Such orders provide most of the
funds for the FSF staff to develop more free software, so please support
our work by ordering from the FSF if you can.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software.
Some are listed in section <a href="#SEC12">Free Software Redistributors Donate</a>; also see
section <a href="#SEC41">Free Software for Microcomputers</a>.  Please note that the Free Software
Foundation is <em>not</em> affiliated with them in any way and is <em>not</em>
responsible for either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of
their responses.

</p>
<p>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partially on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</p>
<p>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of logins.  Please use
one of these other sites that also provide GNU software via FTP (program:
<code>ftp</code>, user: <code>anonymous</code>, password: <var>your e-mail
address</var>, mode: <code>binary</code>).  If you
can't reach one of them, get the software from GNU's main FTP host,
<code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code> (IP address: <code>18.159.0.42</code>).  More
hosts &#38; details are in <tt>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</tt> &#38;
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'</tt> on any host.

</p>
<p>
Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with <code>gzip</code> to
lessen FTP traffic.  Refer to the <tt>`/pub/gnu/=README-about-.gz-files'</tt>
on each FTP site for instructions on uncompressing them.  <code>uncompress</code>
and <code>unpack</code> <em>do not work</em>!

<h3 id="SEC40">FSF T-shirt</h3>

<p>
The front of our T-shirt
has the GNU Emacs Lisp code <code>(USE 'GNU)</code> with "<code>()</code>" being the
dancing parentheses from the cover of our <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual</cite> (drawn by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne Suvasa).  The shirt's back is
imprinted with the Preamble to the GNU General Public License.

</p>
<p>
These shirts come in black, purple, red, pink, burgundy, blue, and
natural (off-white).  When you order, please give 3 choices.  Black
and purple are printed in white; the other colors are printed in
black.  All shirts are thick 100% cotton, and come in sizes S, M, L,
XL, and XXL (but they run small so you may want a larger size than
usual).

</p>
<p>
GNU T-shirts often create spontaneous friendships at conferences &#38;
on university campuses.  They also make great gifts for friends &#38; family,
including children!

<h3 id="SEC41">Free Software for Microcomputers</h3>

<p>
We do not provide support for GNU software on most microcomputers because it is
peripheral to the GNU Project.  However, we are willing to publish
information about groups who do support and maintain them.  If you are
aware of any such efforts, please send the details, including postal
addresses, archive sites, and mailing lists, to either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
See section <a href="#SEC26">CD-ROMs</a>, for microcomputer software
available from the FSF.  Please do not ask us about any other software.  We
do <em>not</em> maintain any of it and have <em>no</em> additional information.

</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Linux</b>
<p>
Linux (named after its main author, Linus Torvalds) is a GPLed kernel that
implements POSIX.1 functionality with SysV &#38; BSD extensions.  Complete
systems based on the Linux kernel are now available for Alpha &#38;
386/486/Pentium/Pentium Pro
machines with one of these buses: ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI.
Since these systems are essentially
variant GNU systems, we call them "GNU/Linux" systems.  An m68k port is in
testing (it runs on high end Amiga &#38; Atari computers).  PowerPC &#38; MIPS
ports are being worked on.
FTP it from
<code>tsx-11.mit.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/linux'</tt> (USA)

</p>

<ul>

<li>

GNU art that highlights a program or aspect of the GNU Project.

</li><li>

Oleo extensions and other free software for business, such as accounting
and project management programs.
Graphical free software applications for ordinary users who are not
programmers.

</li><li>

Volunteers to distribute this Bulletin at technical conferences, trade
shows, local and national user group meetings, etc.  Volunteers to get
articles into their user group newsletters.  Please phone or fax the
numbers on
the top menu,
or email <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code> to make

</li><li>

Volunteers to type and proofread for the GNU Dictionary Project.
See section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for details.

</li><li>

Volunteers to build binaries for Deluxe Distributions &#38; systems not yet on
the section <a href="#SEC31">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>
(especially systems that don't include a C compiler).
Please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li>

A CD-ROM writer,
SCSI tape drives for 4mm DAT cartridge tapes, 8mm Exabyte
cartridge tapes, and 1600 or 6250bpi 1/2inch reel to reel tapes.

</li><li>

600<tt>+</tt> megabyte SCSI disks to give us more space to develop software.

</li><li>

Pentium Pro, Pentium, 486, or 386 PC laptops, notebooks, or compatibles
with 200<tt>+</tt> MB of disk &#38; Ethernet cards.

</li><li>

14.4 or faster modems.

</li><li>

Companies to lend good programmers &#38; technical writers for at least six
months.  True wizards may be welcome for less time, but we have found
that this is the minimum time for a programmer to finish a worthwhile
project.

</li><li>

Professors who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting research
assistants to do actual GNU development, with partial FSF support.

</li><li>

Speech and character recognition software and systems (if the devices
aren't too weird), with the device drivers if possible.  This would help
the productivity of partially disabled people (including a few we know).

</li><li>

New quotes and ideas for articles in the GNU's Bulletin.  We particularly
like to highlight organizations involved with free information exchanges,
software that uses the GNU General Public License, and companies providing
free software support as a primary business.

</li><li>

Information about free software or developers of free software that we may
not know about.  Often, we only find out about interesting projects because
a user writes and asks us why we have not mentioned those projects!

</li><li>

Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU Project or GNU
software.  Send these to the address on
the top menu,
or send a citation to <code>citations@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li>

Money, as always.
<p>
If you use &#38; appreciate our software, please send a contribution.  One way
to help is to order a CD-ROM, or Book with CD-ROM from us.
A business can make a larger contribution by ordering a section <a href="#SEC25">The Deluxe Distribution</a>.  This is especially helpful if you work for an organization
where the word <em>donation</em> is anathema.
Because of the value received, the full dollar amounts of such donations are
not tax-deductible as charitable contributions; however, they may qualify
as a business expense.
