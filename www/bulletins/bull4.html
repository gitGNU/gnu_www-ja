<h3 id="SEC3">GNU's Who</h3>

  <p>The GNU Team has grown larger in the last few months: <b>Brian
  Fox</b> and <b>Opus Goldstein</b> have joined <b>Jay Fenlason</b>
  as the only employees of the Foundation. Most recently, Brian
  created a stand-alone texinfo formatter and browser and is now
  working on <code>sh</code>, the shell. Stacey is running the mail
  room, distributing tapes and manuals and generally doing every
  thing that programmers do not do (e.g. interfacing with the
  "real" world). <b>Jay Fenlason</b> has just finished the profiler
  and is now working on miscellaneous utilities.</p>

  <p><b>Richard Stallman</b> continues to do countless tasks,
  including refining the C compiler, GDB, GNU Emacs, etc.; he has
  also written a termcap manual and several other documents.
  <b>Robert J. Chassell</b> publishes our manuals, and serves as
  the Foundation's treasurer. <b>Chris Hofstader</b> has become our
  fund raiser. (Don't be surprised if he asks you for money.)
  Finally, <b>Len Tower</b> continues to handle electronic
  administrivia (mailing lists, information requests, and system
  mothering).</p>

<h3 id="SEC5">What is the Free Software Foundation?</h3>

  <p>by Richard M. Stallman</p>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating
  restrictions on copying, redistribution, understanding and
  modification of software.</p>

  <p>The word "free" in our name does not refer to price; it refers
  to freedom. First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute
  it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.
  Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control
  it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must
  be made available to you.</p>

  <p>The Foundation works to give you these freedoms by developing
  free compatible replacements for proprietary software.
  Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated
  software system "GNU" that is upward-compatible with Unix. When
  it is released, everyone will be permitted to copy it and
  distribute it to others; in addition, it will be distributed with
  source code, so you will be able to learn about operating systems
  by reading it, to port it to your own machine, to improve it, and
  to exchange the changes with others.</p>

  <p>There are already organizations that distribute free CPM and
  MSDOS software. The Free Software Foundation is doing something
  different.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The other organizations exist primarily for distribution;
    they distribute whatever happens to be available. We hope to
    provide a complete integrated free system that will eliminate
    the need for any proprietary software.</li>

    <li>One consequence is that we are now interested only in
    software that fits well into the context of the GNU system.
    Distributing free MSDOS or Macintosh software is a useful
    activity, but it is not our goal. For information on how to get
    the software we do distribute, please see the article later in
    this issue, `How To Get GNU Software'.</li>

    <li>Another consequence is that we will actively attempt to
    improve and extend the software we distribute, as fast as our
    manpower permits. For this reason, we will always be seeking
    donations of money, computer equipment or time, labor,
    documentation and source code to improve the GNU system.</li>

    <li>In fact, our primary purpose is this software development
    effort; distribution is just an adjunct which also brings in
    some money. We think that the users will do most of the
    distribution on their own, without needing or wanting our
    help.</li>
  </ol>

<h4 id="SEC6">Why a Unix-like System?</h4>

  <p>It is necessary to be compatible with some widely used system
  to give our system an immediate base of trained users who could
  switch to it easily and an immediate base of application software
  that can run on it. (Eventually we will provide free replacements
  for proprietary application software as well, but that is some
  years in the future.)</p>

  <p>We chose Unix because it is a fairly clean design which is
  already known to be portable, yet whose popularity is still
  rising. The disadvantages of Unix seem to be things we can fix
  without removing what is good in Unix.</p>

  <p>Why not imitate MSDOS or CP/M? They are more widely used,
  true, but they are also very weak systems, designed for tiny
  machines. Unix is much more powerful and interesting. When a
  system takes years to implement, it is important to write it for
  the machines that will become available in the future; not to let
  it be limited by the capabilities of the machines that are in
  widest use at the moment but will be obsolete when the new system
  is finished.</p>

  <p>Why not aim for a new, more advanced system, such as a Lisp
  Machine? Mainly because that is still more of a research effort;
  there is a sizeable chance that the wrong choices will be made
  and the system will turn out not very good. In addition, such
  systems are often tied to special hardware. Being tied to one
  manufacturer's machine would make it hard to remain independent
  of that manufacturer and get broad community support.</p>

<h4 id="SEC7">Our First Large Donation.</h4>

  <p>Software Research Associates, a Japanese software house, has
  donated $10,000 to the GNU project. In addition they plan to send
  us a Sun-like SONY workstation and lend us a staff programmer for
  6 months.</p>

  <p>This represents the influence of Kouichi Kishida, who
  organized the Japanese Sigma project (to stimulate Unix
  competence in Japan), only to conclude later that the project had
  gone astray and that a "grass roots movement" was needed instead.
  We hope to be this movement.</p>

<h3 id="SEC8">GNUs Flashes, February 1988</h3>

  <p>by Richard M. Stallman</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Some parts of BSD are becoming free.</b> After years of
    urging from us and others, the people who maintain Berkeley
    Unix have decided to release various parts of it (those which
    don't contain AT&amp;T code) separately as free software. This
    includes substantial programs which we hope to use in GNU, such
    as TCP/IP support and the C-shell.</li>

    <li><b>Berkeley and GNU project cooperating.</b> The next
    release of Berkeley Unix may contain Make, AWK and SH from the
    GNU project instead of those from Unix. The reason is that they
    would like to have improvements in these programs like those in
    system V.3; but they find the new restrictions on V.3 licenses
    unpalatable. Both we and they hope they never get a V.3
    license. We may help them avoid it by providing alternative
    software. GNU Make already supports the system V features; a
    volunteer is now writing the extensions for Gawk.</li>

    <li><b>Shell disappointment.</b> For a year and a half, the GNU
    shell was "just about done". The author made repeated promises
    to deliver what he had done, and never kept them. Finally I
    could no longer believe he would ever deliver anything. So
    Foundation staff member <b>Brian Fox</b> is now implementing an
    imitation of the Bourne shell. Once it is done, we will extend
    it with the features of the Korn shell, thus coming to
    Berkeley's aid.</li>

    <li><b>We may use Sprite, or the Sprite file system with
    MACH.</b> We still hope to use the MACH kernel from CMU when it
    becomes free, after the parts of Berkeley Unix which currently
    form part of it have been replaced as planned. The MACH people
    say that in a month or two certain new features (call-outs from
    the kernel to user code) should be ready that will enable us to
    start working on replacing some of these parts with new code.
    One thing we are considering is adapting the file system from
    Berkeley's Sprite kernel for use in MACH. This file system was
    designed from the beginning to work in a distributed manner.
    The file system is the largest part of MACH that needs
    replacement, now that the Berkeley TCP/IP code, also used in
    MACH, has been declared free.</li>

    <li>
      <b>GNU Make is done.</b> The GNU version of Make is now
      ready, and will be distributed soon. It features
      conditionals, pattern rules, and indirect search for implicit
      rules, and built-in functions for text processing. Here is
      how a GNU Makefile can say that the file `foo' is linked from
      the object files of all C source files in the current
      directory:
      <pre>
   objects=$(subst .c,.o,$(wildcard *.c))
   foo: $(objects)
           $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(LDFLAGS)
</pre>
    </li>

    <li><b>Most libraries are done.</b> <b>Roland McGrath</b>, who
    contributed a great deal to GNU Make, has a nearly complete set
    of ANSI C library functions. We hope they will be ready some
    time this spring. These join the GNU <code>malloc</code>,
    <code>regexp</code> and <code>termcap</code> libraries that
    have existed for some time. Meanwhile, <b>Steve Moshier</b> has
    contributed a full series of mathematical library
    functions.</li>

    <li><b>Profiler replacement done.</b> Foundation staffer <b>Jay
    Fenlason</b> has recently completed a profiler to go with GNU
    C, compatible with `prof' from Berkeley Unix. I hope it will be
    distributed with GNU C soon.</li>

    <li><b>Termcap Manual.</b> We are now publishing the first
    thorough manual for Termcap, which some have suggested ought to
    be entitled "Twice as much as you ever wanted to know about
    Termcap".</li>

    <li><b>GNU mailer being done.</b> <b>Landon Noll</b> and
    <b>Ronald Karr</b> of Amdahl are writing a mail queueing and
    delivery system, called Smail. This project will be a supported
    part of Amdahl's UTS system--and it will be available on
    exactly the same terms as GNU Emacs! We may use this mailer for
    the GNU system, or another mailer that <b>Rayan Zachariasen</b>
    is writing, whichever turns out better.</li>

    <li><b>Ghostscript status</b> Ghostscript, the free Postscript
    for GNU, will with luck be finished by <b>Peter Deutsch</b>
    (except for bugs) in March. Therefore, it might be ready for us
    to distribute a few months later.</li>

    <li><b>Emacs version 18.50</b> This version, to be available in
    a few weeks, will fix many bugs and add support for the 80386,
    the Sun 4, the Convex, the IRIS 4d and the HP 9000 series 800;
    also support for system V.3; and add support for version 11 of
    the X window system.</li>

    <li><b>GDB can read COFF format.</b> COFF is the hairy
    executable file format used on system V. Recently <b>Dave
    Johnson</b> of Brown University contributed support for reading
    COFF files in GDB, the GNU debugger. This code will appear in
    GDB 2.5, accompanying Emacs 18.50. As a result, it should now
    be possible to use GDB on system V without a large amount of
    work. In general, support for COFF isn't important for the GNU
    project, since we are going to use the BSD object file format
    in GNU. Everything said below about VMS applies to COFF support
    as well.</li>

    <li><b>G<code>++</code>, the GNU C<code>++</code> compiler.</b>
    <b>Michael Tiemann</b> of MCC has written a C<code>++</code>
    compiler as an extension of GNU C. This is the first compiler
    that compiles C<code>++</code> directly instead of
    preprocessing it into C. G<code>++</code> is now being tested
    at several sites. Michael believes it is as reliable as
    AT&amp;T's C<code>++</code> preprocessor, but this still leaves
    a long way to go before it is a solid product. G<code>++</code>
    comes with GDB<code>+</code>, a version of GDB that supports
    C<code>++</code> class operations in its expression
    evaluator.</li>

    <li><b>GDB and GNU C support the 32000.</b> GNU C has now
    compiled itself correctly on the Sequent 32000 system. The port
    was done by Michael Tiemann of MCC, who says it is more
    reliable than Sequent's compiler and yields a 40% speedup for
    several programs including a prolog interpreter. Support for
    the 32000 is now released in GNU C version 1.17, along with
    existing support for the 68000 series and the VAX. GDB support
    for the 32000 is in GDB 2.5, to appear with Emacs 18.50.</li>

    <li><b>GNU C ports in progress.</b> People are working on
    porting GNU C to the IBM 370, to the IBM RT/PC, and to the
    80386. The 80386 is the easiest; there is little doubt that
    this port will be available in a few months at most. The other
    machines have more troublesome architectural differences and it
    isn't yet certain whether GNU C can handle them fully without
    significant new features.</li>

    <li><b>GNU C is becoming reliable.</b> GNU C bug reports are
    becoming less frequent, suggesting that it is approaching a
    state of reliability. People are still reporting bugs, but they
    also say they think there are fewer bugs than in commercial
    compilers. <b>John Gilmore</b> is now compiling all of BSD Unix
    with GNU C. He has found several bugs, but not a great number
    for such a large amount of code never before compiled.</li>

    <li><b>GNU C for VMS.</b> Fed up with the deficiencies of the
    VMS C compiler, <b>David Kashtan</b> from SRI decided to spend
    a couple of weeks and make GNU C run on VMS. After making
    considerable changes to satisfy the VMS C compiler, he got it
    running and was able to take most of the changes out. We hope
    to deliver VMS support in GNU C version 1.19 or 1.20, but we
    can't be certain when he will finish merging it and deliver it.
    (Uh oh, I hope it's not going to take a year...) When VMS
    support is delivered to us, the usual GNU C sources will
    contain everything needed for it, but you won't be able to
    compile them with the standard VMS C compiler due to its
    various incompatibilities and deficiencies. You will need a
    binary of GNU C. We plan to offer mag tapes with VMS backup
    savesets containing binaries as well as sources. Other GNU
    programs currently working on VMS include GNU Emacs and Bison.
    Please don't ask us to devote effort to additional VMS support,
    because it is peripheral to the GNU project. We merge in and
    support VMS ports that users do, because it is hard to refuse
    to pass on work that other people have done. But even when the
    changes are clean, this drains considerable effort from our
    real goal, which is to produce a complete integrated system.
    (When they aren't clean, we summon up the courage to ignore
    them.) Merging VMS GNU Emacs and reorganizing the changes to
    ease future maintenance consumed several weeks even though the
    "real work" was done by others. I hope we have learned not to
    let this happen again.</li>

    <li><b>Looking for a tech writer.</b> We are trying to hire a
    technical writer, but so far we have not found anyone suitable.
    It seems that tech writers are not as likely as programmers to
    accept a pay cut to work for our cause. We still have a couple
    of candidates who are possible, and we're still looking.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="SEC9">GNU C++</h3>

  <p><i>brings Object Oriented Programming to GNU</i></p>

  <p>by Michael Tiemann</p>

  <p>C<code>++</code> is among the most popular languages for
  object-oriented programming, for two reasons: it is nearly a
  superset of C, thus making it easily accessible to the C user
  community, and it is supported by AT&amp;T, which leads a
  standards-hungry public to believe that, by subscribing to
  C<code>++</code> (as opposed to SmallTalk, Objective C, or many
  other alternatives), they are following "the standard". About a
  million lines of code have been written in C<code>++</code>.</p>

  <p>Last summer, I was faced with the task of selecting a language
  to use for a new computer architecture project. So strong was the
  influence of C<code>++</code>, that the only decision I could
  make was "which one". C<code>++</code> from AT&amp;T looked like
  the logical choice, except for two problems: it is proprietary
  software, and it is a preprocessor which converts
  C<code>++</code> code into C code. This is slow and means that
  the constructs and concepts of C<code>++</code> aren't available
  in the debugger.</p>

  <p>I decided to see whether we could quickly modify GNU C into a
  C<code>++</code> compiler that has the quality people expect from
  compilers for other languages, such as easy retargetability and
  source-level debugging support. I could--and I have.</p>

  <p>The GNU C<code>++</code> compiler is intended to implement the
  C<code>++</code> programming language, as specified in
  Stroustrup's reference manual. Since most of the GNU C compiler
  is language-independent, it only took six months to make a
  general beta-test release. There are still gaps and bugs, but I
  am working hard on finishing it. All the optimizations of GNU C
  apply equally to C<code>++</code>. I have also added
  C<code>++</code>-inspired optimizations. Some of them, such as
  inlining functions, will also work in some cases for C; others,
  such as optimizing virtual functions, are strictly
  C<code>++</code>.</p>

  <p>GNU C<code>++</code> is not only the first free
  C<code>++</code> compiler; it is the first <em>direct</em>
  compiler for C<code>++</code> available at any price, and it is
  the first C<code>++</code> implementation to interface with a
  C<code>++</code> source-level debugger (GDB<code>+</code>, a
  modification of the existing GNU debugger).</p>

  <p>GNU C<code>++</code> is therefore remarkable from a technical
  point of view, but it is even more remarkable organizationally,
  because it is free software whose development was paid for by the
  Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), a
  consortium established in 1982 to do long range research for
  around 20 shareholder companies.</p>

  <p>In January, six months after I started working on GNU
  C<code>++</code>, the group of MCC shareholders sponsoring the
  computer architecture project were told for the first time that I
  was writing free software. It was easy to imagine they might
  disapprove, Scrooge-like, or even insist on halting the work. But
  it was just the opposite: our cooperation with the Free Software
  Foundation was good news to them. Technology transfer is one of
  the most difficult barriers for shareholders to overcome when
  picking up MCC research.</p>

  <p>When MCC delivers specialized software, it comes with no
  experts beyond those who wrote it, and it is all but unusable
  except by painful learning. When we deliver software that relies
  on a proprietary environment which they do not have access to,
  that software becomes an expensive hostage of its environment. By
  providing software which can be made accessible to anybody,
  without fear of compromising cooperative agreements, it gives the
  shareholders freedom to use that technology in ways previously
  unavailable to them.</p>

  <p>Our group was specifically congratulated on its achievement of
  delivering technology that they wanted, and making that
  technology available via the Free Software Foundation.
  Considering that this is the first free software that MCC has
  ever sponsored, and the incredibly positive reaction that we
  received, it is very exciting to think of the possibilities that
  lie ahead.</p>

<h3 id="SEC10">GNU Software Available Now</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>GNU Emacs</b> In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the
    first Emacs: the extensible, customizable real-time display
    editor. GNU Emacs is his second implementation of Emacs. It's
    the first Emacs available on Unix systems which offers true
    Lisp, smoothly integrated into the editor, for writing
    extensions. It also provides a special interface to MIT's free
    X window system, version 10, which makes redisplay very fast.
    GNU Emacs has been in widespread use since 1985 and often, as
    at MIT's Project Athena, displaces proprietary implementations
    of Emacs because of its greater reliability as well as its good
    features and easier extensibility. GNU Emacs (as of version
    18.50) has run on many kinds of Unix systems: those made by
    Alliant (system release 1, 2 or 3), Amdahl (UTS), AT&amp;T (3b
    machines and 7300 pc), CCI 5/32 and 6/32, Celerity, Convex,
    Digital (Vax, not PDP-11), Dual, Elxsi 6400, Encore, GEC 93,
    Gould, HP (9000 series 200, 300 or 800 (Spectrum) but not
    series 500), IBM (RT/PC running 4.2 and AIX), Integrated
    Solutions (Optimum V with 68020 and VMEbus), Iris (2500 Turbo
    and 4D), LMI (Nu), Masscomp, Megatest, MIPS, NCR (Tower 32),
    Nixdorf Targon 31, Plexus, Pyramid, Sequent, Stride (system
    release 2), Sun (any kind), Tahoe, Tektronix (NS16000 system),
    Texas Instruments (Nu), Whitechapel (MG1), and Wicat. These
    include both Berkeley Unix and System V (release 0, 2, 2.2 or
    3). Emacs also runs on several 80386 machines. It also runs on
    Apollo machines and on VAX/VMS. GNU Emacs use is described by
    the GNU Emacs Manual, available from the Free Software
    Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>GDB</b> GDB is the source-level C debugger written for
    the GNU project in 1986. It offers many features not usually
    found in debuggers on Unix, such as a history that records all
    values examined within the debugger for concise later
    reference, multi-line user-defined commands, and a strong
    self-documentation capability. It currently runs on VAXen under
    4.2 and 4.3bsd, on Suns (systems version 2 and 3), and on some
    32000 systems. A users' manual for GDB is available from the
    Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>GNU CC</b> The GNU C compiler is a fairly portable
    optimizing compiler. It generates good code for the 32000,
    68000, 68020 and Vax. It features automatic register packing
    that makes register declarations unnecessary. It supports full
    ANSI C as of the latest draft standard. The texinfo source of
    the manual "Internals of GNU CC" is included.</li>

    <li><b>Bison</b> Bison is an upward-compatible replacement for
    YACC, with additional as-yet-undocumented features. It has been
    in use for several years.</li>

    <li><b>X Window System</b> X is a portable, network transparent
    window system for bitmap displays written at MIT and DEC. It
    currently runs on DEC VAXstation, Lexidata 90, and most Sun
    Microsystems displays, with others in the works. X supports
    overlapping windows and fully recursive subwindows, and
    provides hooks for several different styles of user interface.
    Applications provided include a terminal emulator, bitmap
    editor, several window managers, clock, window dump and undump
    programs, hardcopy printing program for the LN03 printer, and
    several typesetting previewers. Version 10 of X Windows is
    distributed on the GNU Emacs tape; version 11 (which is totally
    incompatible) is distributed on the GCC tape. Emacs version
    18.50 will support both versions 10 and 11.</li>

    <li><b>MIT Scheme</b> Scheme is a simplified, lexically scoped
    dialect of Lisp, designed at MIT and other universities for two
    purposes: teaching students of programming, and researching new
    parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques. MIT
    Scheme is written in C and runs on many kinds of Unix systems.
    Sorry, we do not distribute documentation with the the current
    distribution version of MIT Scheme. A new standard for Scheme
    has been designed by the various labs that work on Scheme, and
    work is going on at MIT to change MIT Scheme to fit. Once that
    is done, the standard will serve as a manual for MIT Scheme. At
    that time, we will distribute both the new release of Scheme
    and the standard. In the meantime, several books have been
    published about Scheme.</li>

    <li><b>Hack</b> Hack is a display oriented adventure game
    similar to Rogue.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="SEC11">The GDB Song</h3>

  <p><i>with thanks to Joel Bion, Mark Baushke, and Lynn

  <p>Somebody asked us what was GDB. With apologies to Oscar
  Hammerstein II, Richard Rodgers, and Julie Andrews, we offered
  the following reply:</p>

  <p>Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to

<h3 id="SEC12">Why Was Copyright Invented?</h3>

  <p>by Richard M. Stallman</p>

  <p>Now that copyright is becoming a public nuisance that the
  public tries to ignore, copyright owners try to justify this
  imposition by calling it an intrinsic right. As they tell it,
  their intrinsic right is a tradition that makes the public good
  irrelevant.</p>

  <p>This is contrary to the facts of the history of copyright.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court has stated explicitly what copyright was
  for. Writing for the Court, Justice Stewart explained:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a
    fair return for an "author's" creative labor. But the ultimate
    aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for
    the general public good. `The sole interest of the United
    States and the primary object in conferring the [copyright]
    monopoly,' this Court has said, `lie in the general benefits
    derived by the public from the labors of authors.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
<tt>             </tt>---Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal (286 US 123, 127)
</pre>

  <p>So when copyright interferes with the public use of a program,
  that directly attacks the reason for having copyright.</p>

<h3 id="SEC13">When Programs Become Available</h3>

  <p><i>or Rather, how NOT to find out when a program becomes
  available...</i></p>

  <p>by Richard M. Stallman</p>

  <p>I have dared to make a few predictions about when certain
  programs will be ready for distribution. Now, after the fact, I
  hope that wasn't a mistake.</p>

  <p>Creating a given program often takes much longer than
  expected. If this happens, many of you who are eager to use it
  might have the idea of phoning or writing to ask me whether the
  program is available yet. Or, even worse, to describe which parts
  are completed, or which machines it will be ported to, or how
  easy it will be to port to certain machines, or which features
  are going to be implemented.</p>

  <p>Some of these questions have no answers. When a program isn't
  finished, we don't know which features we will add while
  finishing it. We don't make plans to port programs because our
  usual policy is to leave porting up to you. This is a way of
  recruiting wider participation.</p>

  <p>Responding to all possible inquiries would divert time and
  energy and slow the completion of the program, causing even more
  inquiries. Were we to permit this to happen, the amount of time
  left to devote to programming could approach zero.</p>

  <p>Only you can save the GNU project from this absurd fate.
  Please exert your will power, be patient, and wait for us to
  announce that programs are available. If you would like to see
  more GNU software appear faster, the best thing to do is to
  volunteer a significant amount of your time.</p>

  <p>The best way to find out quickly when a piece of GNU software
  is released or updated for general on-line distribution is to
  arrange to receive the info-gnu mailing list on which our
  announcements are made. To receive info-gnu, send a request
  to</p>

  <p><code>ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!info-gnu-request
  (usenet)</code></p>

  <p><code>info-gnu-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (internet)</code></p>

  <p>Some specific programs such as Emacs, GCC, GDB, GNU Chess, and
  G<code>++</code> have specific mailing lists of their own on
  which new versions are announced. To be on these lists, just
  mention in your request which programs you are interested in.</p>

  <p>Tape distribution normally starts some weeks later than
  on-line distribution, either because we demand a higher standard
  of reliability for users who cannot easily get upgrades, or
  because we are hopelessly confused and can't get our act
  together. We generally make another electronic announcement when
  tape distribution starts. You can order tapes in advance if you
  wish, if you understand that delivery may be delayed for many
  weeks while we work on reliability.</p>

  <p>When we expect true reliability to take many months to
  achieve, we may offer a beta-test tape at an earlier date, as we
  are doing with GNU C. We announce these tapes in the usual
  ways.</p>

  <p>If you can't receive Usenet or Internet mail and you are
  planning to order a tape of a specific program, you can telephone
  the Foundation to find out whether the program is available for
  tape distribution. Our phone number is (617) 876-3296. It is best
  to call in the morning, EST, as you will be more likely to reach
  Opus Goldstein, our office and shipping person, rather than our
  tape machine. In general, Opus cannot contact each person
  individually to say when a tape is ready, but perhaps an
  arrangement can be made if it is important.</p>

  <p>If you are planning to get a copy from someone else, please
  ask that person to inform you when it is ready. This will spread
  the burden.</p>

  <p>If you are truly desperate for a prognostication, you might
  try consulting your local fortune-tellers. They don't know any
  less than we about the future.</p>

<h4 id="SEC14">GNU Wish List</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Money, as always. Please remember, we are tax-deductable
    and, among other things, we want to hire somebody to write
    documentation!!!</li>

    <li>Office equipment, e.g. a desktop copier; a nifty new phone
    answering machine that deletes old messages; a couple of Sun
    workstations or VAXen; 1200/2400/4800/9600 baud modems; and an
    electric typewriter that has a delete key.</li>

    <li>Highly knowledgible technical people to write excellent
    documentation on a volunteer basis.</li>

    <li>Top flight programmers to help write utilities and
    compilers for new languages.</li>

    <li>Clipings of media articles mentioning GNU.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="SEC15">How To Get GNU Software</h3>

  <p>All the software and publications from the Free Software
  Foundation are distributed with permission to copy and
  redistribute. The easiest way to get a copy of GNU software is
  from someone else who has it. Just copy it from them.</p>

  <p>If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
  software from the host <tt>`prep.ai.mit.edu'</tt>. For more
  information, read the file
  <tt>`/u2/emacs/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</tt> on that host.</p>

  <p>If you cannot get the software from a friend or over the net,
  the Free Software Foundation distributes tapes for a copying and
  distribution fee. See the order form on the inside back
  cover.</p>

  <p>If you do not have net access, and your computers cannot use
  either of the two media we distribute on, you must get our
  software from third party groups--people and organizations that
  do not work with us, but have our software in other forms. For
  your convenience, other groups that are helping to spread GNU
  software are listed below. Please note that the Free Software
  Foundation is <i>not</i> affiliated with them in any way, and is
  not responsible for either the currency of their versions or the
  swiftness of their responses.</p>

  <p>These Internet sites have some GNU programs available for
  anonymous FTP: <code>louie.udel.edu</code>,
  <code>nic.nyser.net</code>, <code>bu-it.bu.edu</code>,
  <code>uunet.uu.net</code>, <code>spam.istc.sri.com</code>, and
  <code>simtel20.arpa</code> (under PD:&lt;Unix.GNU&gt;).</p>

  <p>Information on how to uucp some GNU programs is available via
  electronic mail from: <code>arnold@skeeve.UUCP</code>,
  <code>ihnp4!hutch!barber</code>, <code>hqda-ai!merlin</code>.
  Also, you can ask:
  <code>hao!scicom!qetzal!upba!ugn!nepa!denny</code> or else from:
  <code>postmaster@uunet.uu.net</code>.</p>

  <p>Ohio State also uucps GNU programs. They post their
  instructions monthly to newsgroup <code>comp.sources.d</code> on
  Usenet. Current details from Karl Kleinpaste
  <code>karl@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu</code> or
  <code>karl@ohio-state.arpa</code> or
  <code>...!cbosgd!osu-cis!karl</code>; or Bob Sutterfield
  (substitute bob for karl in the above addresses).</p>

  <p>Information on obtaining floppy disks of GNU Emacs for the
  AT&amp;T Unix PC (aka 3B1 or PC7300) is available via electronic
  mail from: <code>brant@manta.uucp</code>.</p>
