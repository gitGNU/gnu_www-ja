<h3 id="SEC4">What Is the FSF?</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" (pronounced "guh-new", "GNU's Not Unix") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</p>
<p>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have two specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program and give it
away to your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to change a
program as you wish, by having full access to source code.  You can study
the source and learn how such programs are written.  You may then be able
to port it, improve it and share your changes with others.  If you
redistribute GNU software you may charge a distribution fee or give it
away, so long as you include the source code and the GPL; see section <a href="#SEC5">What Is Copyleft?</a>, for details.

</p>
<p>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</p>
<p>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</p>
<p>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President;
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC5">What Is Copyleft?</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.  But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <em>all</em> users.  To prevent this,
<em>copyleft</em> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</p>
<p>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <em>GNU General Public License</em> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <em>GNU Library General
Public License</em> (LGPL), applies to a few GNU libraries.  This license
permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables under certain
conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU source code
distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available upon request.

</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of public license appear at the end of each
license.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC6">What Is the Hurd?</h3>

<p>
The Hurd will be the foundation of the whole GNU system.  It is is a
collection of server processes that run on top of Mach, a
free message-passing kernel developed by CMU.  Mach's virtual memory
management and message-passing facilities are extensively used by the Hurd.
The GNU C Library will provide the Unix system call interface, using the
Hurd servers for those services it can't provide itself.

</p>
<p>
One goal of the Hurd is to establish a framework for shared development and
maintenance.  The Hurd is like GNU Emacs in that it will allow users to
create and share useful projects without knowing much about the internal
workings of the system--projects that might never have been attempted
without freely available source, a well-designed interface, and a
multiple server design.

</p>

<p>
Currently there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700 &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting GCC) once a Mach port to a particular platform exists.  Right
now we are using the University of Utah's Mach distribution, but we
hope that will be unified with the distribution produced by the Open
Software Foundation.

</p>
<p>
Important progress has been made recently; see section <a href="#SEC17">GNUs Flashes</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are significant projects relating to the Hurd for which we need
volunteers.  Experienced system programmers who are interested should send
mail to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the
GNU C Library to new systems is another way to help development of the
Hurd.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC7">Free Software Redistributors Donate</h3>

<p>
by Richard Stallman

</p>
<p>
The <b>Sun Users Group Deutschland</b> has agreed to add a donation to the
FSF to the price of their next CD-ROM of GNU software.  Potential purchasers
will know precisely how much of the price is for the FSF and how much is for SUGD.
<b>Austin Code Works</b>, a redistributor of free software, is supporting
free software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling price for
the GNU software packages they produce and sell.
<b>Walnut Creek CD-ROM, Inc.</b> and <b>Info
Magic</b>, two more free software redistributors, are also giving us a
percentage of their selling price.
<b>CQ Publishing</b> made a large donation from the sales of their book
about GAWK in Japanese.

</p>
<p>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.

</p>
<p>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves,
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</p>
<p>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</p>
<p>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits are donated",
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</p>
<p>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler contribute more; major new features and programs contribute the
most.

</p>
<p>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC8">Help from Free Software Companies</h3>

<p>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

</p>
<p>
These free software support companies regularly donate a part of their
income to the Free Software Foundation to support the development of new
GNU programs.  Listing them here is our way of thanking them.
Wingnut has made a pledge to donate 10% of their income to the FSF, and
have also purchased several Deluxe Distribution packages in Japan.
(Wingnut is SRA's special GNU support group).

<h3 id="SEC9">Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund Appeal</h3>

<p>
Phil Zimmermann, who wrote the public-key encryption program known as
Pretty Good Privacy ("PGP") and released it on the Internet, is now
facing prosecution for "exporting" it out of the United States.

</p>
<p>
There is a law prohibiting the export of encryption software from the
US.  Zimmermann did not do this, but the US government hopes to
establish the proposition that posting an encryption program on a BBS
or on the Internet constitutes exporting it--in effect, stretching
export control into domestic censorship.

</p>
<p>
If the government wins, that will have a chilling effect on the free
flow of information on the global network, as well as on everyone's
privacy from government snooping.

</p>
<p>
Estimates are that Zimmermann's defense will cost over $100,000--and
that doesn't even count lawyers' fees.  To help pay this, a legal
trust fund, the Philip Zimmermann Defense Fund (PZDF), has been
established.  Donations are accepted in any reliable form, check,
money order, or wire transfer, and in any currency, as well as by
credit card.

</p>
<p>
To send a check or money order by mail, make it payable, <em>not</em> to

<h3 id="SEC10">Free Software Support</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our
mission is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way
to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers now do; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

</p>
<p>
The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support and other
consulting services.  It is in the file <tt>`etc/SERVICE'</tt> in the GNU Emacs
distribution, <tt>`SERVICE'</tt> in the GCC distribution and
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE'</tt> on a GNU FTP host (see section <a href="#SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</a> for a list).
Contact us if you would like a copy or wish to be listed in it.
Those service providers who share their income with the FSF are
listed in section <a href="#SEC8">Help from Free Software Companies</a>.

</p>
<p>
If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.  We have
many Internet mailing lists for bug reports, announcements and questions.
They are also gatewayed into USENET news as the <code>gnu.*</code> newsgroups.
You can request a list of the mailing lists from either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part
of preparing a new improved version.  We may send you a patch for a bug so
that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug
report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from
another user who reads our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the
Service Directory.

</p>
<p>
Please do not ask us to help you install software or figure out how to use
it--but do tell us how an installation script fails or where
documentation is unclear.

</p>
<p>
If you have no Internet access, you can get mail and USENET news via
UUCP.  Contact a local UUCP site, or a commercial UUCP site such as:

</p>

<pre>
   <b>UUNET Communications Services</b>

   Fax:       +1-703-204-8001
   Electronic-Mail: <code>info@uunet.uu.net</code>
</pre>

<p>
A list of commercial UUCP and Internet service providers is posted
periodically to USENET in the newsgroup <code>news.announce.newusers</code> with
<tt>`Subject: How to become a USENET site'</tt>.  You can also get it via
anonymous FTP from the host <code>rtfm.mit.edu</code> in the file
<tt>`How_to_become_a_USENET_site'</tt>, in the directory
<tt>`/pub/usenet-by-group/news.announce.newusers'</tt>.

</p>
<p>
When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development or by writing free software
improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

<h3 id="SEC11">News from the LPF</h3>

<p>
 
<b>Changing Tactics:</b>

</p>
<p>
The LPF has recently been placing less emphasis on communicating its position
to individual programmers, and more on communicating with government and
industry.

</p>
<p>
During 1994, the LPF testified at two patent office hearings and filed papers
in two court cases (the Lotus v. Borland appeal and another look and feel
case in Texas).  These activities are less visible to the public, but directly
relate to the goals of the LPF.

</p>
<p>
The LPF has also decided to drop the boycott against look and feel plantiffs
as a tactic.

</p>
<p>
The LPF has been attempting to establish relationships with companies within
the software industry.  Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Synopsis, and Wind River
Systems have all publically issued statements opposed to software patents.

</p>
<p>
It is a slow process, but real progress is being made.

</p>
<p>
 
<b>Web Site:</b>

</p>
<p>
The LPF now has a World Wide Web server.  It contains general information
relating to the LPF, various documents the LPF has published, and any other
related information the LPF is able to assemble.  The Web site is available
at URL: <tt>`http://www.lpf.org/'</tt>.  Please suggest improvements to:
<code>webmasters@lpf.org</code>.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC12">What Is the LPF?</h3>

<p>
The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) aims to protect the freedom
to write software.  This freedom is threatened by "look-and-feel"
interface copyright lawsuits and by software patents.

</p>
<p>
The League for Programming Freedom is a grass-roots organization of
professors, students, business people, programmers, users, and and even
software companies dedicated to bringing back the freedom to write
programs.  The League is not opposed to the legal system that Congress
intended--copyright on individual programs.  Our aim is to reverse the
recent changes made by judges in response to special interests.

</p>
<p>
Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers, managers
and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.

</p>
<p>
To join, please send a check and the following information:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

Your name and phone numbers (home, work, or both).

</li><li>

The address to use for League mailings, a few each year (please indicate
whether it is your home address or your work address).

</li><li>

The company you work for, and your position.

</li><li>

Your email address, so the League can contact you for political action.
(If you don't want to be contacted for this, please say so, but please
provide your email address anyway.)

</li><li>

Please mention anything about you which would enable your<br />
endorsement of the LPF to impress the public.

</li><li>

Please say whether you would like to help with LPF activities.

</li></ul>

<p>
The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation and is not
concerned with the issue of free software.  The FSF supports the LPF because,
like any software developer smaller than IBM, it is endangered by
software patents and interface copyrights.
You are in danger, too!  It would be easy to ignore
the problem until you or your employer is sued, but it is more prudent
to organize before that happens.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC13">End of Apple Boycott</h3>

<p>
For several years, the Free Software Foundation has participated in a
boycott of Apple, Lotus &#38; Xerox sponsored by the League for Programming
Freedom.

</p>
<p>
The League for Programming Freedom has decided to end the boycott
(see section <a href="#SEC11">News from the LPF</a>).  So the FSF will now treat
Apple operating systems like other non-free operating systems.  This means
we will accept patches for Apple systems when that is easy and painless,
and usually not otherwise.

</p>
<p>
The aim of the GNU Project is developing the GNU operating system.
Supporting other operating systems is something we do as a sideline
when it seems good to do.  If changes to support some other system are
likely to take substantial maintenance time, it is better for us to
reject them, and spend that time on tasks that contribute directly to
the GNU system.

<h3 id="SEC14">Third Annual GNU Seminars in Japan</h3>

<p>
The FSF sponsored the third annual GNU Technical Seminar on December 5,
1994 in Tokyo.  Richard Stallman spoke on the GNU Project and the GNU
extension language plans.  Gavin T. Nicol then spoke on the World
Wide Web and compared the existing free operating systems.  Finally,
Michael Bushnell spoke on the Hurd.  Bob Myers and David
Littleboy translated the English lectures into Japanese.  Over 140 people
attended the seminar, and some Japanese publications interviewed Richard
Stallman.  The FSF also premiered the latest editions of our Source Code
and Compiler Tool Binaries CD-ROMs.  The seminar was supported by several
organizations who did all the behind-scene work: LS-JP, NSUG,
JUS, SEA, and CSRL-Aoyama Gakuin; and was supervised by
Masayuki Ida, Carl Hoffman and Nobuyuki Hikichi.
The Lisp Society of Japan, Computer Science
Research Lab at Aoyama Gakuin University, and
Software Research Associates, Inc. (SRA), and their staff
provided help in countless ways for this seminar and the entire trip to
Japan.

</p>
<p>
Seminars were also held at Aoyama Gakuin on December 7th, where Richard
Stallman spoke on GNU Emacs Lisp as an Extension Language, and at The
University of Aizu where both Richard Stallman &#38; Michael Bushnell
spoke.

</p>
<p>
The Japan Unix Society gave the FSF a booth at Unix Fair '94 in Yokohama.
We thank all the volunteers and organizations who helped run this booth.

</p>
<p>
Our success at the seminars and trade show exceeded our expectations.  We
received many unsolicited donations from individual supporters and users'
groups, and are thankful for the number of enthusiastic volunteers who
helped us.  In the future we hope to appear at even more Unix events both
in Japan and elsewhere.  If you would like to host a seminar, or need a
speaker for a conference, please contact either address on
the top menu.

<h3 id="SEC15">GNU and Other Free Software in Japan</h3>

<p>
Mieko (<code>h-mieko@sra.co.jp</code>) and Nobuyuki Hikichi
(<code>hikichi@sra.co.jp</code>) continue to volunteer for the GNU
Project in Japan.  They translate each issue of this Bulletin into
Japanese and distribute it widely, along with their translation of the
GNU General Public License Version 2.  This translation of the GPL is
authorized by the FSF and is available by anonymous FTP from
<code>ftp.sra.co.jp</code> in <tt>`/pub/gnu/local-fix/GPL2-j'</tt>.
They are working on a formal translation of the GNU Library General
Public License.  They also solicit donations and offer GNU software
consulting.

</p>
<p>
<code>nepoch</code> (the Japanese version of Epoch) and MULE are available and
widely used in Japan.  MULE (the MULtilingual Enhancement of GNU Emacs) can
handle many character sets at once.  Its features are being merged
into the FSF's version of Emacs.  The FSF does not distribute
<code>nepoch</code>, but MULE is available (see section <a href="#SEC38">December 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a> and the section <a href="#SEC43">Emacs Diskettes</a>).  You
can FTP it from <code>sh.wide.ad.jp</code> in <code>/JAPAN/mule</code> or
<code>etlport.etl.go.jp</code> in <code>/pub/mule</code>.  See section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>,
for more information about MULE.

</p>
<p>
The Village Center, Inc. prints a Japanese translation of the
<cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite> and uploads the Texinfo source to
various bulletin boards.  They have also published a copylefted book,
Nobuyuki's and Mieko's <cite>Think GNU</cite>.  This appears to be the first
non-FSF copylefted publication in Japan.  Part of their profits are
donated to the FSF.  Their address is:</p>

The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, ICOT, has
released the "ICOT Free Software (IFS)" distribution.  The famous
Fifth Generation Computing System project produced this distribution,
which includes 100 systems for symbol processing, knowledge
processing, problem solving, inference, and natural language
processing.  Many of them are based on parallel logic programming.
Nearly half of the software can run on Unix workstations.  For details,
contact <code>ifs@icot.or.jp</code>.

</p>
<p>
There is a mailing list in Japan to discuss both hardware and software
which is under the GNU General Public License.  This list provides
information about making your own computer system.  The main language used
on the list is Japanese.  If you are interested in getting information or
having discussions in English, contact <code>mka@apricot.juice.or.jp</code>
or <code>ishiz@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp</code>.

</p>
<p>
Many groups in Japan now distribute GNU software.  They include JUG, a PC
user group; ASCII, a periodical and book publisher; the Fujitsu FM
Towns users group; and SRA's special GNU support group, called Wingnut, who
also purchased the first Deluxe package in Japan.  (Since then, there have
been several other purchases of the Deluxe package in Japan.)

</p>
<p>
It is easy to place an order directly with the FSF from Japan, thus funding
new code.  To get an FSF Order Form written in Japanese, ask
<code>japan-fsf-orders@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.
We encourage you to buy
software on tapes or CDs: for example, every 160 tape orders allows FSF to
hire a programmer for a year to write more free software.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC16">Free Unix for Romania</h3>

<p>
In 1992, Marius Hancu, <code>hancu@crim.ca</code>, began a project to send
freely distributable software to Romania, called "Free Unix for Romania."
At that time, little such software was available in Romania.  Recently, Ted
Lungu, <code>lungu@thak.jpl.nasa.gov</code>, took over project coordination.

</p>
<p>
The main focus has been on sending editors, debuggers, compilers, and
operating system distributions using GNU/Linux and Free/NetBSD--all
freely redistributable and able to run on inexpensive 80386 and 80486
PCs.

</p>
<p>
In addition, they have sought donations, sent equipment and computer
science books to Romania, and created a list of volunteer technical
consultants.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC17">GNUs Flashes</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Hurd</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC6">What Is the Hurd?</a>)

The GNU Hurd now runs many programs native.
It can run GCC, <code>make</code>, Emacs,
and most other GNU utilities.  Progress is being made so rapidly that by the
time you read this it probably does much more.  It is right on the verge of
being self-hosting (able to run on its own well enough to compile its own
source code and be used for its own development).

For a complete system we still have much more work to do, but we will make
an alpha release as soon as the network software is finished and shared
libraries have been implemented.  We have a mailing list to distribute
announcements about progress; to be added to it, send mail to
<code>hurd-announce-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>Mach and 4.4BSD--Lite for PA-RISC HP 700</b>

An almost complete snapshot of a Mach/4.4BSD--Lite based single-server for
the PA-RISC HP 700 is available from
<tt>`jaguar.cs.utah.edu:/flexmach'</tt> by anonymous FTP.
The snapshot provides binaries for the "Lites" BSD-based
single-server, freely redistributable sources for a complete Mach
kernel with integrated support for the PA-RISC 1.1 (HP 700)
platform, a complete GNU tool chain for the ELF object format, and
other software.  (Sources for the floating point emulation library are
not available.)
The developers caution that this (December 1994) snapshot is for
hard-core operating system hackers only.  This is not a formal release
and is not yet robust.  Check
<tt>`http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flexmach/'</tt> for more
information.

</li><li><b>GNU Software Now Works on MS-DOS</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS
for 386 and 486 based machines.  We ship binaries &#38; sources on the
section <a href="#SEC42">DJGPP Diskettes</a>, section <a
href="#SEC43">Emacs Diskettes</a>, &#38; the section <a
href="#SEC36">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>, &#38; soon on the
section <a href="#SEC34">MS-DOS CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li><b>GAS merged with Binutils</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Due to large amounts of shared code, GAS, the GNU Assembler, has been
merged with GNU Binutils.

</li><li><b>Two calculators in one</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The RPN calculator <code>dc</code>, once packaged alone, is now packaged with
<code>bc</code>.  Unlike the traditional Unix implementation, GNU <code>bc</code> is not
just a front end for <code>dc</code>.

</li><li><b>The Dictionary Project</b>

The FSF has a copy of the <cite>Century Dictionary</cite>, an unabridged
dictionary now in the public domain, and we are planning to put it online.
We tried OCR, but it wasn't reliable enough.

We're now waiting for the results from the first batch of
dictionary volunteers.  We've decided to see how well the process
works with the first batch before we ask anyone else to do work.

</li><li><b>4.4BSD--Lite</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC30">Berkeley 4.4BSD--Lite Tape</a>)

The FSF is distributing 4.4BSD--Lite (instead of the old
Berkeley Networking 2 tape).  The "Lite" refers to the omitting of some
proprietary files that still remain in the full 4.4BSD distribution.
However, 4.4BSD--Lite is considerably more complete than the previous
Networking 2 release.

</li><li><b>Common Lisp Freed!</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

We now distribute GNU Common Lisp (GCL).  Previously, GCL had distribution
terms under which each user had to have a signed paper contract on file.
However, the authors recently decided to switch to the LGPL.

</li><li><b>New Packages on the Languages Tape</b>         (Also

see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

OBST, the GNU Objective-C Library and Perl 5 have been added.

</li><li><b>New Program on the Utilities Tape</b>         (Also

see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

<code>netfax</code> has been replaced by <code>FlexFAX</code>.

</li><li><b>New Programs on the Source Code CD-ROM</b>

This CD-ROM has all the new programs and changes on the tapes.
See section <a href="#SEC38">December 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, for details.

</li><li><b>GNU Column in Linux Magazine</b>

Arnold Robbins, <code>arnold@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>, a long-time volunteer
for the GNU Project, is the author of "What's GNU?", a semi-regular column in
the monthly magazine <cite>Linux Journal</cite>.  The column discusses the
GNU Project, its software and other interesting free software.  Authors
of significant GNU software packages occasionally write columns as
guest authors.  For subscription information, contact
<code>subs@ssc.com</code>.

</li><li><b>Experimental Tape Takes a Recess</b>         (Also

see section <a href="#SEC24">Tapes</a>)

We are not currently distributing the Experimental Tape because most of the
programs that were on it are now stable and have moved to other tapes.

</li><li><b>The FSF now takes American Express</b>

We now accept the American Express credit card in addition to Visa,
Mastercard, JCB, Diner's Club, and Carte Blanche.  Please note that we are
charged about 5% of an order's total amount in credit card processing fees.
Please consider paying by check instead, or adding on a 5% donation to make
up the difference.

</li><li><b>Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</b>

We have a new edition of the Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM with updated
versions of all the software on it.
It contains executables of the GNU compiler tools
for some systems that don't normally come with a compiler.  This allows
users of those systems to compile their own software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.  See section <a
href="#SEC36">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>, for details,
including which platforms are supported.

We hope to include more systems with each update of this CD.  If you
can help build binaries for new systems, or have one to suggest,
please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li><b>Source CD-ROM Subscriptions</b>

We offer a subscription service for the Source Code CD-ROM in
addition to our tape subscription service.  For the price of 3 CD-ROMs
(plus any shipping costs) you get the next 4 that we make.  We make between
two and four updates a year.  See section <a href="#SEC46">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</a>.

</li><li><b>FSF Accepts Orders and Donations via Fax</b>

You can now send orders and donations to the FSF by fax.  Please fax us a
completed
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
including credit card information, since orders must
be prepaid.  We do <em>not</em> accept purchase orders.  The number is
<tt>+</tt>1--617--492--9057.
Individuals in Japan who are unable to place international calls may use
the "free dial" numbers: 0031--13--2473 (KDD) and
0066--3382--0158 (IDC).

</li><li><b>A new FSF T-shirt!</b>

There is a new version of our T-shirt.
The previous version of the T-shirt will remain available while
supplies last, but please contact the office to see if we have
what you would like before ordering.  See section <a href="#SEC52">FSF T-shirt</a>.

</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC18">Guile</h3>

<p>
If a software system includes several programs that are extensible, they
should all use the same extension language implementation.  This means less
for extension writers to learn, and that libraries of extensions may
be useful with more than one program.  A common language enables programs
to exchange complex data structures or source code.  A common
implementation conserves both system and maintainer resources.

</p>
<p>
The GNU Project has started to build Guile: GNUs' Ubiquitous Extension
Language.  We will produce a library which programmers can use to make
any ordinary C program extensible.  We expect to use this library in
many GNU programs and hope to see wide use elsewhere.
We are basing Guile on SCM, a version of Scheme written by Aubrey Jaffer
(see the JACAL item in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>).  A number of cosmetic changes
are being made, so the interpreter will be more useful as a C library.
Volunteers are working on a complete Posix interface, an SCSH-like library,
and a module system.
Releases with only some of the features mentioned will begin early in 1995.
SCM is already available.

</p>
<p>
The copyright terms for Guile will permit the use of the library even in
proprietary programs.  We plan to use terms similar to those used for X11.

</p>
<p>
Choosing Scheme helps to put aside controversy over "which extension
language is best".  It is a convenient target language, into which other
languages may be translated.  Even though maintainers must choose one
extension language implementation, users can choose from any number of
extension languages.

</p>
<p>
Anyone can make Guile applications programmable in their favorite
language simply by writing a new translator.  We intend to have a
language that is like simplified C and one that is like an interactive
command processor syntax.  Guile will be able to run Emacs Lisp programs.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC19">Help the GNU Locale Project</h3>

<p>
The GNU locale package (glocale) is a set of tools that provides a
framework to help other GNU packages produce multilingual messages.
glocale is currently undergoing alpha testing.

</p>
<p>
A handful of GNU packages have already been adapted and provided with
message translations for several languages.  Translation teams have begun
to organize, using these packages as a starting point.  But there are many
more packages and many languages for which we have no volunteer
translators.  If you'd like to volunteer to work at translating messages,
please send mail to <code>gnu-locale@prep.ai.mit.edu</code> indicating what
language(s) you can work on.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</h3>

<p>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</p>

<ul>

<li><b>New CD-ROMs from the FSF</b>         (see section <a href="#SEC32">CD-ROMs</a>)

We will release the sixth edition of its Source Code CD-ROM in March
1995.  We will also be releasing two new CDs: the MS-DOS CD-ROM in
February 1995; &#38; the Debian GNU/Linux CD-ROM in Spring 1995; both of
them will come in a book describing their contents.  Contact either address
on
the top menu,
for more information then.

</li><li><b>Programming in Emacs Lisp, An Intro.</b>         (see section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>)

In February, the FSF will publish the first edition of <cite>Programming in
Emacs Lisp, An Introduction</cite> by Robert J. Chassell (who, in another guise,
is the FSF's Secretary/Treasurer).  This book is an elementary
introduction, written for people who are not programmers &#38; who do
not necessarily wish to be, but who do want to extend Emacs.  The
book walks though code used in GNU Emacs &#38; has many sample programs
that you can run in Emacs.

</li><li><b>GNU Objective-C Class Library</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Future versions, of the GNU Objective-C Class Library (<code>libobjects</code>),
will have String objects that are integrated into the
Collection object hierarchy, a better allocation/deallocation
mechanism, improved features for distributed objects (including a
back-end using Mach ports instead of sockets), more extensive
random number generator facilities, and ports to more machines.
Volunteers are needed for additional projects; contact
<code>mccallum@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GNUStep: GNU OpenStep</b>

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement over a year ago, there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, which is named GNUStep.  Work has started on an
implementation using an existing library written in Objective-C as a
starting point.  Much work remains to be done to bring this library close to
the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should contact
<code>Paul_Kunz@slac.stanford.edu</code>.

</li><li><code>makeinfo</code> <b>and the World Wide Web</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

<code>makeinfo</code> is being modified to translate Texinfo source files into
HTML documents that can be displayed from the Internet's World Wide Web.

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Version 1.1 of GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was released in November.
Development is now concentrating on a TK based graphical window
interface; a beta version will be available by time you read this Bulletin.
Both GCL specific documentation, and a Texinfo version of the proposed ANSI
standard have been written.  Work on conditions, installing the new
compiler, and internals is underway.  Volunteers for parts of the move to
the ANSI standard and to convert the current GCL specific documentation to
Texinfo are most welcome; contact <code>schelter@math.utexas.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display
editor &#38; computing environment.  The next release will have support for
Windows NT, be able to communicate with multiple X displays at once &#38; be
able to save text properties in files for editing formatted text.  Future
releases will include: different visibility conditions for regions &#38; for
multiple windows showing the same buffer, incrementally saving the undo
history in a file, so that you can undo older changes in the history,
support for both variable-width fonts &#38; wide character sets
including
all the world's major languages.

</li><li><b>C Interpreter</b>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to the GNU compiler and debugger.
This task is partly finished.  GCC now generates byte code (for all
supported languages: C, C<tt>++</tt> and Objective-C) and another package
interprets it.

To make this work usable, we need to add features to GDB to load the byte
code dynamically.  We also would like C compiler support for compiling just
a specified few functions in a file.  Due to limited resources, the FSF
cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GCC</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

New front ends for GCC are being developed for Pascal and Chill.  See the
GNU Fortran and GNAT items in this article for news on those front ends.

</li><li><b>GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator</b>         (<em>Not yet available from the FSF</em>)

A front end for much of Ada 9X (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is available
via anonymous FTP from <code>cs.nyu.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/gnat'</tt>.  News about
GNAT is posted to the USENET newsgroup <code>comp.lang.ada</code>.

</li><li><b>GNU Fortran</b>         (For info on <code>f2c</code> &#38; GCC, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

We have released GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>), developed by Craig Burley,
for public beta testing.  For the time being, <code>g77</code> produces code
that is generally object-compatible with <code>f2c</code>, and they use the
same run-time library (<code>libf2c</code>).

The <code>g77</code> front end is stable, but work is needed to bring its
overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the levels the
Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: writing
documentation; improving diagnostics; speeding up compilation
especially for large initialized data tables; implementing
<code>INTEGER*2</code>, <code>INTEGER*8</code>, and similar features; and
arranging to build and install <code>libf2c</code> automatically.

We don't know when these things will be done, but we hope some will be
finished in the coming months.  You can speed progress by working on
some of them or by offering funding.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <code>g77</code>.  To
subscribe, ask <code>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.
To contact the developer of <code>g77</code>, write to
<code>fortran@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>Ghostscript</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Ghostscript 3.0 will be released and distributed by the FSF late in 1995; a
future GNU's Bulletin will have a more definite date.  It will implement
the full Postscript Level 2 language except for LZW compression, which
can't be freely implemented because of software patents.
(Prohibitions on programming like this are what the
League for Programming Freedom is
fighting.  See section <a href="#SEC12">What Is the LPF?</a>, for details.)

</li><li><b>Oleo</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Volunteers are writing an Oleo manual and extensions to the Oleo interface.

</li><li><b>rx</b>, a faster regular expression library

Tom Lord has written <code>rx</code>, a new regular expression library which is
faster than the current library we use.  Currently it is only being
distributed with <code>sed</code>; eventually we will distribute it as a separate
package as well.

This new library is nearly a drop-in replacement for the current <code>regex</code>
library used by the GNU Project, but it needs a few more features to
be used in Emacs.

</li><li><b>Smalltalk</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The next release, version 1.2, will use the
GNU Autoconf configuration system, and will have significant performance
improvements and memory requirement reductions, more control over the
memory allocation, ability to use the Smalltalk interpreter as a subroutine
(i.e., callable from C), better interfaces to the X Window System, ability
to represent and manipulate C data structures in Smalltalk, conditional
compilation facilities, large integer support, a complete GUI based class
browsing system, better (more complete/usable) TCP/IP interfaces, exception
support, and weak references &#38; finalization support.

</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC21">Freely Available Texts</h3>

<p>
Freely redistributable information isn't just software.  We have a list
of groups providing various books, historical documents, and more.  You can
FTP the list in file <tt>`/pub/gnu/FreelyAvailableTexts'</tt> from
<code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Please let either address on
the top menu
know of additional entries.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC22">GNU Software</h3>

<p>
We are using a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages in
order to compile them.  It uses the <code>autoconf</code> program (see item
below).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same
alternatives for naming machine and system types.

</p>
<p>
When the GNU system is complete it will be possible to configure and build
the entire system at once, eliminating the need to separately configure
each individual package.

</p>
<p>
The configuration scheme can also specify both the host and target system,
so you can easily configure and build cross-compilation tools.

</p>

<p>
 
<b>GNU software currently available:</b>

</p>
<p>
(For new features and coming programs, see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>.)

</p>

<ul>

<li><code>acm</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>acm</code> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

</li><li><b>Autoconf</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <code>m4</code> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <code>m4</code> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

</li><li><b>BASH</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU shell, BASH (<b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell), is compatible with
the Unix <code>sh</code> and offers many extensions found in <code>csh</code> and
<code>ksh</code>.  BASH has job control, <code>csh</code>-style command history, and
command-line editing (with Emacs and <code>vi</code> modes built-in, and the
ability to rebind keys) via the <b>readline</b> library.  BASH conforms to
the POSIX 1003.2 shell specification.

</li><li><code>bc</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>bc</code> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <code>bc</code> follows the POSIX.2-1992
standard, with several extensions including multi-character variable names,
an <code>else</code> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <code>dc</code> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <code>bc</code> is not implemented as a <code>dc</code> preprocessor.

</li><li><b>BFD</b>         (BinCD, DjggpD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The <b>B</b>inary <b>F</b>ile <b>D</b>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <code>ld</code> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with source for Texinfo documentation (not yet
published on paper).

Presently BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.

</li><li><b>Binutils</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

Binutils includes the programs:
<code>ar</code>,
<code>c<tt>++</tt>filt</code>,
<code>demangle</code>,
<code>gas</code>,
<code>gprof</code>,
<code>ld</code>,
<code>nlmconv</code>,
<code>nm</code>,
<code>objcopy</code>,
<code>objdump</code>,
<code>ranlib</code>,
<code>size</code>,
<code>strings</code>,
and
<code>strip</code>.

Binutils Version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU
linker <code>ld</code> emits source-line numbered error messages for
multiply-defined symbols and undefined references.  It interprets a
superset of the AT&#38;T Linker Command Language, which gives general control
over where segments are placed in memory.  <code>nlmconv</code> converts object
files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.  <code>objdump</code> can
disassemble code for a29k, ALPHA, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k,
m88k, MIPS, SH, SPARC, &#38; Z8000 processors, and can display other data
(e.g., symbols &#38; relocations) from any file format understood by BFD.

</li><li><b>Bison</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCompT)

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<code>yacc</code>.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Bison Manual</cite>
and reference card are included.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GNU C Library</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most of the
functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible with 4.4BSD and
includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

The C Library will perform many functions of the Unix system calls in
the Hurd.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <code>malloc</code> which
wastes less memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU regular-expression
functions (<code>regex</code> and <code>rx</code>) now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2
standard.

GNU <code>stdio</code> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <code>fmemopen</code> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <code>printf</code> formats to use a C function you have written.  For
example, you can safely use format strings from user input to implement
a <code>printf</code>-like function for another programming language.
Extended <code>getopt</code> functions are already used to parse options,
including long options, in many GNU utilities.

The C Library runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2),
HP 9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation
(Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486 (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2 &#38;
SCO ODT 2.0), Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3) &#38; SGI (Irix 4).  Texinfo
source for the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> is included
(see section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>); the manual is now being updated.

</li><li><b>GNU C<tt>++</tt> Library</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU C<tt>++</tt> library (libg<tt>++</tt>) is an extensive collection of C<tt>++</tt>
<cite>forest</cite> classes, an IOStream library for input/output routines,
and support tools for use with G<tt>++</tt>.  Supported classes include:
Obstacks, multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers,
arbitrary length Strings, BitSets and BitStrings.

Version 2.6.2 includes the initial release of the libstdc<tt>++</tt> library.
This implements library facilities defined by the forthcoming
ANSI/ISO C++ standard, including the Standard Template Library.

</li><li><b>Calc</b>         (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator &#38; mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
can use Calc just as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many more
features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based)
entry; logarithmic, trigonometric &#38; financial functions; arbitrary
precision; complex numbers; vectors; matrices;
dates;
times; infinities; sets; algebraic simplification; differentiation &#38;
integration.  It outputs to <code>gnuplot</code> &#38; comes with source for a
reference card &#38; a Manual.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GNU Chess</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

GNU Chess lets the computer play a full game of chess with you.  It
runs on most platforms &#38; has dumb terminal, "curses" &#38; X terminal
interfaces.

GNU Chess implements many specialized features including the null move
heuristic, a hash table with aging, the history heuristic (another form of
the earlier killer heuristic), caching of static evaluations, &#38; a
database which lets it play the first several moves of the game quickly.

Recent improvements include better heuristics, faster evaluation, thinking
on opponent's time, Swedish &#38; German language support, support for more
book formats, a rudimentary Bobby Fischer clock, &#38; bug fixes.

It is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft, Mike McGann, Chua Kong
Sian, &#38; Tim Mann on behalf of the FSF.

</li><li><b>CLISP</b>         (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) by Bruno
Haible and Michael Stoll.  It mostly supports the Lisp described by
<cite>Common LISP: The Language (2nd edition)</cite>.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a subset of CLOS and, for some machines, a
screen editor.  The user interface language (English, German, French) is
chooseable at run time.  Major packages that run in CLISP include
CLX &#38; Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory &#38;
runs on many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2, the Atari ST,
Amiga 500--4000) &#38; Unix-like systems
(GNU/Linux, Sun4, SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTstep &#38; others).

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>         (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp.
It is very portable and extremely efficient on a wide class of
applications.  It compares favorably in performance with commercial Lisps
on several large theorem--prover and symbolic algebra systems.  It
supports the CLtL1 specification but is moving towards the proposed ANSI
definition.  It was formerly know as Kyoto Common Lisp.

GCL compiles to C and then uses the native optimizing C compilers (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args and one value turns into a
C function of the same number of args and returning one value, so GCL
is maximally efficient on such calls.  It has a
conservative garbage collector which allows great freedom for the C
compiler to put Lisp values in arbitrary registers.  It has a source
level Lisp debugger for interpreted code, with display of source code in
an Emacs window.  It has profiling tools based on the C profiling tools,
which count function calls and percentage of time spent in each
function.
CLX works with GCL.
There is an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  PCL runs with GCL (see PCL
item later in this article).  See section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for
about GCL.

GCL version 1.1 is released under the GNU Library General Public
License.

</li><li><code>cpio</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>cpio</code> is an alternative archive program with all the features of SVR4
<code>cpio</code>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite>
standard.  <code>mt</code>, a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
<code>cpio</code>.

</li><li><b>CVS</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

CVS, the Concurrent Version System, manages software revision and release
control in a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group environment.  It
works best in conjunction with RCS versions 4 and above, but will parse
older RCS formats with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See Berliner,
Brian, "CVS-II: Parallelizing Software Development," <cite>Proceedings of
the Winter 1990 USENIX Association Conference</cite>.  To find out how to get a
copy of this report, ask <code>office@usenix.org</code>.

</li><li><b>DejaGnu</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs that provides a single
front end for all tests.  The framework's flexibility and consistency makes
it easy to write tests for any program.  DejaGnu comes with <code>expect</code>,
which runs scripts to conduct dialogs with programs.

</li><li><b>Diffutils</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>diff</code> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
Diffutils package contains <code>diff</code>, <code>diff3</code>, <code>sdiff</code>,
and <code>cmp</code>.

Recent Diffutils improvements include:
a new <code>diff</code> option to do all input/output in binary;
this is useful on some non-Posix hosts, and more consistent handling of
character sets.

Plans for the Diffutils package include support for
internationalization (e.g., error messages in Chinese), and for some
non-Unix PC environments.

</li><li><b>DJGPP</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD)

DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G<tt>++</tt> 2.6.0 (see the GCC item in this section)
to the i386 MS-DOS platform.  The DJGPP package also contains a 32-bit
80386 DOS extender with symbolic debugger; development libraries; and ports
of Bison, <code>flex</code>, GAS, and the GNU Binutils.  Full source code is
provided.
It requires at least 5MB of hard disk space to install and 512K
of RAM to use.
It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768),
XMS &#38; VDISK memory allocation,
<code>himem.sys</code>,
VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, &#38; 386MAX), and
DPMI (e.g., Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, &#38; QDPMI).

Ask <code>djgpp-request@sun.soe.clarkson.edu</code> to join a DJGPP users
mailing list.

</li><li><code>dld</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>dld</code> is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your
program with the <code>dld</code> library allows you to dynamically load object
files into the running binary.  Currently supported are VAX (Ultrix), Sun 3
(SunOS 3.4 &#38; 4.0), SPARC (SunOS 4.0), Sequent Symmetry (Dynix), &#38; Atari ST.

</li><li><code>doschk</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

This program is intended as a utility to help software developers ensure
that their source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms with
14-character filenames and on MS-DOS with 8+3 character filenames.

</li><li><code>ecc</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>ecc</code> is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking program, which can
correct three byte errors in a block of 255 bytes and detect more severe
errors.  Contact <code>paulf@Stanford.EDU</code> for more information.

</li><li><code>ed</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Ed is the standard text editor.

</li><li><b>Elib</b>         (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

Elib is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>

In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an
extensible, customizable real-time display editor and computing
environment.  GNU Emacs is his
second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated into
the editor--for writing extensions, and provides an interface to the
X Window System.  In addition to its powerful native command set,
extensions which emulate other popular editors are distributed: vi and
EDT (DEC's VMS editor).  It has many other features which make it a
full computing support environment.  Source for the <cite>GNU Emacs
Manual</cite>,
the <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, and a reference
card come with the software.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs 18</b>         (EmcsD, LspEmcT, SrcCD, VMSEmcsT)

GNU Emacs 18.59 is the last release of version 18 from the FSF.  We are

Other configurations supported by Emacs 18 should work with few changes in
Emacs 19; as users tell us more about their experiences with different
systems, we will augment the list.  Also see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>.

</li><li><code>es</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>es</code> is an extensible shell based on <code>rc</code> with
first class functions, lexical scope, exceptions, and
rich return values (i.e., functions can return values other than just
numbers).  Like <code>rc</code>, it is great for both interactive use and for
scripting, particularly since its quoting rules are much less baroque
than the C or Bourne shells.

</li><li><code>f2c</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>f2c</code> converts Fortran-77 source files into C or C<tt>++</tt>, which can be
compiled with GCC.  You can get bug fixes by FTP from site
<code>netlib.att.com</code> or by email from
<code>netlib@research.att.com</code>.
The fixes are summarized in the file <tt>`/netlib/f2c/changes.Z'</tt>.
See section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for information about GNU Fortran.

</li><li><b>Fileutils</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

The fileutils work on files:
<code>chgrp</code>,
<code>chmod</code>,
<code>chown</code>,
<code>cp</code>,
<code>dd</code>,
<code>df</code>,
<code>dir</code>,
<code>du</code>,
<code>install</code>,
<code>ln</code>,
<code>ls</code>,
<code>mkdir</code>,
<code>mkfifo</code>,
<code>mknod</code>,
<code>mv</code>,
<code>mvdir</code>,
<code>rm</code>,
<code>rmdir</code>,
<code>sync</code>,
<code>touch</code>,
&#38;
<code>vdir</code>.
Only some of these are on the section <a href="#SEC44">Selected Utilities Diskettes</a>.

</li><li><b>Findutils</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>find</code> is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations on
them.  Also included are <code>xargs</code>, which applies a command to a
list of files, and <code>locate</code>, which scans a database for file
names that match a pattern.

</li><li><b>Finger</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger <em>server</em>
host, and other hosts at that site configured as finger <em>clients</em>.
The server host collects information about who is logged in to the
clients.  To finger a user on any host at a GNU Finger site, a single
query gets useful information.  GNU Finger supports many
customization features, including per--user customization.

</li><li><code>flex</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

<code>flex</code> is a replacement for the <code>lex</code> scanner generator.
<code>flex</code> was written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and generates far more efficient scanners than <code>lex</code> does.
Source for the <cite>Flex Manual</cite> and reference card are included.
See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>FlexFAX</b>         (UtilT)

FlexFAX is a facsimile system for Unix systems.  It supports sending,
receiving, and polled retrieval of facsimile, as well as transparent
shared data use of the modem.

Information is also available on the World Wide Web at URL:
<tt>`http://www.vix.com/flexfax/'</tt>.

</li><li><b>Fontutils</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The fontutils create fonts for use with Ghostscript or TeX, starting
with a scanned type image and converting the bitmaps to outlines.  They
also contain general conversion programs and other utilities.

Fontutils programs include:
<code>bpltobzr</code>,
<code>bzrto</code>,
<code>charspace</code>,
<code>fontconvert</code>,
<code>gsrenderfont</code>,
<code>imageto</code>,
<code>imgrotate</code>,
<code>limn</code>,
and
<code>xbfe</code>.

</li><li><b>GAWK</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

GAWK is upwardly compatible with the latest POSIX versions
of <code>awk</code>.  It also provides several useful extensions not found in
other <code>awk</code> implementations.  Texinfo source for the <cite>GAWK
Manual</cite> comes with the software.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GCC</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCompT)

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports multiple languages; the source
file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.  The GNU C
Compiler distribution includes support for C, C<tt>++</tt> and Objective-C.
Support for Objective-C was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <code>object</code>).  As much as possible,
G<tt>++</tt> is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not
with <code>cfront</code> (AT&#38;T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

The GNU C Compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which
performs automatic register allocation, common sub-expression
elimination, invariant code motion from loops, induction variable
optimizations, constant propagation and copy propagation, delayed
popping of function call arguments, tail recursion elimination,
integration of inline functions and frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf
function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, a certain
amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE) between basic blocks
(though not all of the supported machine descriptions provide for
scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes to
instructions, and many local optimizations that are automatically
deduced from the machine description.  Position-independent code is
supported on the 68k, i386, i486, Pentium, Hitachi Slt, Hitachi H8/300,
Clipper, 88k, SPARC &#38; SPARClite.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <code>long long
int</code>).  It supports extended floating point (type <code>long double</code>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.

GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C &#38; GNU C extensions (including:
nested functions support, nonlocal gotos &#38; taking the address of a label).

GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs &#38; DWARF.

GCC generates code for many CPUs, including: a29k, Alpha, ARM, AT&#38;T
DSP1610, Convex cN, Clipper, Elxsi, Fujitsu Gmicro, H8/300, HP--PA (1.0 and
1.1) i370, i386, i486, Pentium, i860, i960, m68k, m68020, m68030, m68040,
m88k, MIPS, ns32k, PDP-11, Pyramid, ROMP, RS6000, SH, SPARC, SPARClite,
VAX, &#38; we32k.

Operating systems supported include: AIX, ACIS, AOS, BSD, Clix, Ctix,
DG/UX, Dynix, Genix, GNU/Linux, HP-UX, ISC, Irix, Luna, LynxOS, Mach, Minix,
NewsOS, OSF, OSF-Rose, RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2, SunOS 4, SysV, Ultrix, Unos,
VMS &#38; Windows/NT.

The old (version 1) machine descriptions for the Alliant, Tahoe and Spur
(as well as a new port for the Tron) do not work, but are still included in
the distribution in case someone wants to work on them.

Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
easy as building a compiler for the same target machine.

We no longer maintain version 1 of GCC, G<tt>++</tt>, or libg<tt>++</tt>.

Texinfo source for the <cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> manual,
is included with GCC.

See section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for later releases of GCC.

</li><li><b>GDB</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

In GDB (<b>G</b>NU <b>D</b>e<b>B</b>ugger), object files and symbol tables are
read via the BFD library,
which allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out &#38; COFF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and
watchpoints (breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression
changes).  Exception handling, SunOS shared libraries and C<tt>++</tt> multiple
inheritance are only supported when used with GCC version 2.

GDB has a command line user interface; GNU Emacs comes with
a GDB mode, and <code>xxgdb</code> provides an X interface (but it is not
distributed or maintained by the FSF; FTP it
from <code>ftp.x.org</code> in the <tt>`/contrib'</tt> directory).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
has simulators for the
Zilog Z8001/2, Hitachi H8/300, H8/500 &#38; Super-H.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <em>targets</em> a platform
means that it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that
GDB can <em>host</em> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but
cannot necessarily debug native programs.  GDB can:


<ul>

<li><em>target</em> &#38; <em>host</em>:

Amiga 3000 (Amix),
DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
DECstation 3100 &#38; 5000 (Ultrix),
HP 9000/300 (BSD, HP-UX),
HP 9000/700 (HP-UX),
i386 (BSD, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, LynxOS, NetBSD, SCO),
IBM RS/6000 (AIX, LynxOS),
Motorola Delta m88k (System V, CX/UX), PC532 (NetBSD),

Z8000.

</li><li><em>host</em>, but not <em>target</em>:

IBM RT/PC (AIX),
and

</li></ul>

GDB can use the symbol tables emitted by the vendor supplied compilers of
most MIPS-based machines, including DEC.  (These tables are in a
format which almost nobody else uses.)  Source for the manual
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> and a reference card are included.
See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><code>gdbm</code>         (LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

<code>gdbm</code> is the GNU replacement for the traditional
<code>dbm</code> and <code>ndbm</code> libraries.  It implements a database using quick
lookup by hashing.  <code>gdbm</code> does not ordinarily need sparse file formats
(unlike its Unix and BSD counterparts).

</li><li><b>Ghostscript</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Ghostscript is the GNU release of Ghostscript, which is an interpreter
for the Postscript graphics language (see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for news on
future plans).

The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 2.6.2.  Features include the ability
to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript runs (X
Window System and Microsoft Windows), resulting in much better-looking
screen displays; improved text file printing (like <code>enscript</code>); a
utility to extract the text from a Postscript language document; a much more
reliable (and faster) Microsoft Windows implementation; support for
Microsoft C/C<tt>++</tt> 7.0; drivers for many new printers, including the
SPARCprinter, and for TIFF/F (fax) file format; many more Postscript Level
2 facilities, including most of the color space facilities (but not
patterns), and the ability to switch between Level 1 and Level 2
dynamically.  Version 2.6.2 adds a LaserJet 4 driver and several
important bug fixes to version 2.6.1.

Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language
by writing
directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to a file for
later printing (or to a bitmap file that you can manipulate with other
graphics programs).

Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA, or SuperVGA graphics (but please do
<em>not</em> ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use PCs).

</li><li><b>Ghostview</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Tim Theisen, <code>ghostview@cs.wisc.edu</code>, has created Ghostview, a
previewer for multi-page files with an X11 user interface.  Ghostview
and Ghostscript function as two cooperating programs; Ghostview creates a
viewing window and Ghostscript draws in it.

</li><li><code>gmp</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

GNU mp is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic on signed integers
and rational numbers.  It has a rich set of functions with a regular
interface.

</li><li><b>GNATS</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNATS (<b>GN</b>ats: <b>A</b> <b>T</b>racking <b>S</b>ystem, not to be confused with
GNAT, The GNU Ada Translator) is a bug-tracking system.  It is based upon
the paradigm of a central site or organization which receives problem
reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic mail.  Although it has
been used primarily as a software bug-tracking system so far, it is
sufficiently generalized so that it could be used for handling system
administration issues, project management or any number of other
applications.

</li><li><code>gnuplot</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

<code>gnuplot</code> is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
expressions and data.  It handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces
(3 dimensions).  Curiously, the program was neither written nor named for
the GNU Project; the name is a coincidence.  GNU Emacs' Calc mode uses
<code>gnuplot</code> smoothly.

</li><li><b>GnuGo</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GnuGo plays the game of Go (Wei-Chi); it is not yet very sophisticated.

</li><li><code>gperf</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>gperf</code> generates perfect hash tables.  There are two
implementations of <code>gperf</code>, written in C and C<tt>++</tt>.  Both produce
hash functions in either C or C<tt>++</tt>.

</li><li><b>GNU Graphics</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Graphics is a system which produces x-y plots from ASCII or binary data.
It supports traditional Unix device independent plot files, Postscript and
Tektronix 4010 compatible output devices and plot previewing under the X
Window System.  Features include output support in TekniCAD TDA and ln03
file formats; a <code>spline</code> program replacement; examples of shell
scripts using <code>graph</code> and <code>plot</code>; and a statistics toolkit.  Ask
Rich Murphey, <code>Rich@rice.edu</code>, to help test/port it to
anything beyond a SPARCstation.

</li><li><b>grep</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

This package has GNU <code>grep</code>, <code>egrep</code>, and <code>fgrep</code> which
output lines that match inputed patterns.
They are much faster than the traditional Unix versions.

</li><li><b>Groff</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

Groff is a document formatting system, which includes
drivers for Postscript, TeX <code>dvi</code> format, and typewriter-like
devices, as well as implementations of
<code>eqn</code>,
<code>nroff</code>,
<code>pic</code>,
<code>refer</code>,
<code>tbl</code>,
<code>troff</code>,
and the
<code>man</code>,
<code>ms</code>,
and
<code>mm</code> macros.
Groff's <code>mm</code> macro package is almost
compatible with the DWB <code>mm</code> macros and has several extensions.
Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley <code>me</code> macros and an
enhanced version of the X11 <code>xditview</code> previewer.
Written in C<tt>++</tt>, these programs can be compiled with GNU
C<tt>++</tt> Version 2.5 or later.
A driver for the LaserJet 4 series of printers is currently in test.

Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed
are complete Texinfo documentation, a <code>grap</code> emulation (a <code>pic</code>
preprocessor for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar
to <code>pm</code> (see <cite>Computing Systems</cite>, Vol. 2, No. 2; ask
<code>office@usenix.org</code> how to get a copy) and an ASCII
output class for <code>pic</code> so that <code>pic</code> can be integrated with
Texinfo.  Questions and bug reports from users who have read the
documentation provided with Groff can be sent to
<code>bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><code>gzip</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, LspEmcT, SrcCD, UtilT)

Some of the contents of our tape and FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our tapes and FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <code>compress</code>, we have switched to another
compression program, <code>gzip</code>.  (Prohibitions on programming like this
are fought by the League for Programming Freedom, see section <a href="#SEC12">What Is the LPF?</a>, for details.)  <code>gzip</code> can expand LZW-compressed files but uses
another, unpatented algorithm for compression which generally produces
better results.  It also expands files compressed with System V's
<code>pack</code> program.

</li><li><code>hello</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU <code>hello</code> program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the GNU
General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

Like any truly useful program, <code>hello</code> contains a built-in mail
reader.

</li><li><code>hp2xx</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>hp2xx</code> reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and raster
output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently supported vector
formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex RGIP, Metafont and various
special TeX-related formats, and simplified HP-GL (line drawing only)
for imports.  Raster formats supported include IMG, PBM, PCX, &#38; HP-PCL
(including Deskjet &#38; DJ5xxC support).  Previewers work under X11 (Unix),
OS/2 (PM &#38; full screen), MS-DOS (SVGA, VGA, &#38; HGC).

</li><li><code>indent</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>indent</code> is a revision of the BSD version.  By default, it formats
C source according to the GNU coding standards.  The BSD default, K&#38;R and
other formats are available as options.  It is also possible to define your
own format.
GNU <code>indent</code> is more robust and provides more functionality than other
versions, e.g., it handles C<tt>++</tt> comments.

</li><li><b>Ispell</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

Ispell is an interactive spell checker that suggests "near misses" as
replacements for unrecognized words.  System &#38; user-maintained
dictionaries for multiple languages can be used.  Standalone &#38; GNU Emacs
interfaces are available.

Previously, the GNU Project had its own version of ispell ("Ispell 4.0"),
but has dropped it for a parallel branch that has had more
development ("Ispell 3.1").  The version numbers do not accurately
reflect the lineage of these two branches; version 3 is more
sophisticated.

</li><li><b>JACAL</b>         <em>Not available from the FSF</em>

JACAL is a symbolic mathematics system for the manipulation and
simplification of equations and single and multiple-valued algebraic
expressions constructed of numbers, variables, radicals,
differential operators, and algebraic and holonomic functions.  Vectors,
matrices, and tensors of these objects are also included.

JACAL was written in Scheme by Aubrey Jaffer.  It comes with SCM, an IEEE
P1178 and R4RS compliant version of Scheme written in C.  SCM runs on
Amiga, Atari-ST, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix, and similar
systems.  SLIB is a portable Scheme library used by JACAL.

</li><li><code>less</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>less</code> is a display paginator similar to <code>more</code> and <code>pg</code> but
with various features (such as the ability to scroll backwards) that most
pagers lack.

</li><li><code>m4</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>m4</code> is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.
It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (for example,
handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).  <code>m4</code> also has
built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
arithmetic, etc.

</li><li><code>make</code>         (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, LspEmcT, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>make</code> supports POSIX 1003.2 and has all but a few obscure
features of the BSD and System V versions of <code>make</code>, as well as many
of our own extensions.  GNU extensions include long options, parallel
compilation, flexible implicit pattern rules, conditional execution and
powerful text manipulation functions.  Recent versions have improved error
reporting and added support for the popular <samp>`+='</samp> syntax to append
more text to a variable's definition.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Make
Manual</cite> comes with the program.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

GNU <code>make</code> is on several of our tapes because some system vendors
supply no <code>make</code> utility at all, and some native <code>make</code> programs
lack the <code>VPATH</code> feature essential for using the GNU configure system
to its full extent.  The GNU <code>make</code> sources have a shell script to
build <code>make</code> itself on such systems.

DJ Delorie has ported GNU <code>make</code> to MS-DOS using the GO32 extender.
MS-DOS binaries for <code>make</code> are available with the DJGPP
distribution.

MULE is a MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs.  It can handle many
character sets at once including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese,
Thai, Greek, the ISO Latin-1 through Latin-5 character sets, Ukrainian,
Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and other Cyrillic alphabets.  A text buffer in
MULE can contain a mixture of characters from these languages.  To input
any of these characters, you can use various input methods provided by MULE
itself.  In addition, if you use MULE under some terminal emulators (kterm,
cxterm, or exterm), you can use its input methods.  MULE is being merged
into GNU Emacs.  See section <a href="#SEC15">GNU and Other Free Software in Japan</a>, for more
information about MULE.

</li><li><b>NetHack</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Support) is a portable collection of C<tt>++</tt> classes, similar to those in
Smalltalk-80, which has been developed by Keith Gorlen of the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), using the C<tt>++</tt> programming language.

</li><li><code>nvi</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>nvi</code> is a free implementation of the <code>vi</code>/<code>ex</code> Unix editor.
It has most of the functionality of the original <code>vi</code>/<code>ex</code>,
except "open" mode &#38; the <code>lisp</code> option, which will be added.
Enhancements over <code>vi</code>/<code>ex</code> include split screens with multiple
buffers, handling 8-bit data, infinite file &#38; line lengths, tag stacks,
infinite undo &#38; extended regular expressions.  It runs under GNU/Linux,
BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, BSDI, AIX, HP-UX, DGUX, IRIX, PSF, PTX, Solaris,

<code>patch</code> is our version of Larry Wall's program to take <code>diff</code>'s
output and apply those differences to an original file to generate the
modified version.

</li><li><b>PCL</b>         (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

PCL is a free implementation of a large subset of CLOS, the Common Lisp
Object System.  It runs under both GCL and CLISP, mentioned above.

</li><li><code>perl</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sh</code> and C, as well as interfaces to the Unix
system calls and many C library routines.

</li><li><code>ptx</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>ptx</code> is our version of the traditional permuted index
generator.  It handles multiple input files at once, produces TeX
compatible output, &#38; outputs readable <em>KWIC</em> (KeyWords In Context)
indexes.

It does not yet handle input files that do not fit in memory all at
once.

</li><li><code>rc</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>rc</code> is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than
<code>csh</code>) and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.
It's intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
scripts.  It inspired the shell <code>es</code>.

</li><li><b>RCS</b>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &#38;
management of software projects.  When used with GNU <code>diff</code>, RCS can
handle binary files (executables, object files, 8-bit data, etc).
Also see the item about CVS in this section.

</li><li><code>recode</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>recode</code> converts files between character sets and usages.
When exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the
offending characters or fall back on approximations.  This program
recognizes or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to
transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character
sets are supported.

</li><li><b>regex</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
internationalization features.  In the past, it has been included in
many GNU programs which do regular expression matching.  Now it is
available separately.  An alternative regular expression package, <code>rx</code>,
comes with <code>sed</code>; it has the potential to be faster than
<code>regex</code> in most cases, but still needs work.

</li><li><b>Scheme</b>         (SchmT, SrcCD)

For information about Scheme, see section <a href="#SEC28">Scheme Tape</a>.

</li><li><code>screen</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>screen</code> is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate
"screens" (ttys) on a single physical character-based terminal.  Each
virtual terminal emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022
functions.  Arbitrary keyboard input translation is also supported.
<code>screen</code> sessions can be detached and resumed later on a
different terminal type.

</li><li><code>sed</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>sed</code> is a stream-oriented version of <code>ed</code>.  GNU <code>sed</code>

(see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>).

</li><li><b>Sharutils</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>shar</code> makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services, while <code>unshar</code>
helps unpack these shell archives after reception.  <code>uuencode</code> prepares a
file for transmission over an electronic channel which ignores or otherwise
mangles the high order bit of bytes, while <code>uudecode</code> does the
converse transformation.

</li><li><b>Shellutils</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
captured pieces can be returned into play.

GNU Shogi has been created by modifying GNU Chess; GNU Shogi implements the
same features as GNU Chess and uses similar heuristics.  As a new feature,
sequences of partial board patterns can be introduced in order to help the
program play toward specific opening patterns.
There are both character and X display interfaces.

GNU Shogi is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

</li><li><b>Smalltalk</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language system
written in highly portable C.  It has been successfully ported to many Unix
and some other platforms, including DOS (but these non-Unix ports are not
available from the FSF).  Current features include a binary image save
capability, the ability to invoke user-written C code and pass parameters
to it, a GNU Emacs editing mode, a version of the X protocol invocable from
Smalltalk, optional byte-code compilation tracing and byte-code execution
tracing, and automatically loaded per-user initialization files.  It
implements all of the classes and protocol in the Smalltalk-80 book
"Smalltalk-80: The Language", except for the graphic user
interface (`GUI') related classes.

See section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for later releases of Smalltalk.

</li><li><b>Superopt</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for a
given function.  You provide the GNU superoptimizer, <code>gso</code>, a
function, a CPU to generate code for, and how many instructions you can
accept.  Its application in GCC is described in the <cite>ACM SIGPLAN
PLDI'92</cite> proceedings.
Superopt supports: SPARC, m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM
RS/6000, AMD 29000, Intel 80x86, Pyramid, DEC Alpha, &#38; HP--PA.

</li><li><code>tar</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>tar</code> includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
special features that allow <code>tar</code> to be used for incremental and full
backups.  Unfortunately, GNU <code>tar</code> implements an early draft of the
POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite> standard which is different from the final
standard.  Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible
fashion is not trivial.

</li><li><b>Termcap Library</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for <tt>`libtermcap.a'</tt> on
any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap
entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is source for the
<cite>Termcap Manual</cite> in Texinfo format.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>TeX</b>         (SrcCD)

TeX is a document formatting system that handles complicated
typesetting, including mathematics.  It is GNU's standard text formatter.

You can obtain TeX from the University of Washington, which maintains and
supports a tape distribution of TeX for Unix systems.  The core material
consists of Karl Berry's <code>web2c</code> TeX package, the sources for which
are available via anonymous ftp; retrieval instructions are in
<tt>`pub/tex/unixtex.ftp'</tt> on <code>ftp.cs.umb.edu</code>.  If you receive any
installation support from the University of Washington, please consider
sending them a donation.

To order a full distribution written in <code>tar</code> on either a
1/4inch 4-track QIC-24 cartridge or a 4mm DAT cartridge, send
$210.00 to:

Please make checks payable to the University of Washington.
Do not specify any other payee.  That causes accounting difficulties.
Checks must be in U.S. dollars, drawn on a U.S. bank.
Prepaid orders are the only orders that can now be handled.
Overseas sites: please add to the base cost $20.00 for shipment via
air parcel post, or $30.00 for shipment via courier.
Please check with the above for current prices and formats.

</li><li><b>Texinfo</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, LspEmcT, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

Texinfo is a set of utilities which generate both printed manuals and
online hypertext documentation (called "Info").  There are also
programs for reading online Info documents.  Version 3 has both GNU Emacs
Lisp and standalone programs written in C or shell script.  Texinfo mode
for GNU Emacs enables easy editing and updating of Texinfo files.
Programs provided include
<code>makeinfo</code>,
<code>info</code>,
<code>texi2dvi</code>,
<code>texindex</code>,
<code>tex2patch</code>,
and
<code>fixfonts</code>.
Source for the <cite>Texinfo Manual</cite> is included.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>Textutils</b>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

The Textutils programs manipulate textual data.  They include:
<code>cat</code>,
<code>cksum</code>,
<code>comm</code>,
<code>csplit</code>,
<code>cut</code>,
<code>expand</code>,
<code>fmt</code>,
<code>fold</code>,
<code>head</code>,
<code>join</code>,
<code>nl</code>,
<code>od</code>,
<code>paste</code>,
<code>pr</code>,
<code>sort</code>,
<code>split</code>,
<code>sum</code>,
<code>tac</code>,
<code>tail</code>,
<code>tr</code>,
<code>unexpand</code>,
<code>uniq</code>,
and
<code>wc</code>.

</li><li><b>Tile Forth</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

Tile Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth--83 standard written
in C, allowing it to be easily ported to new systems,
and extended with "any" C-function (graphics, windowing, etc).

Many Forth libraries with full documentation are available including
ones for top-down parsing, multi-threads, and object oriented
programming.

</li><li><code>time</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>time</code> is used to report statistics (usually from a shell) about the
amount of user, system and real time used by a process.  On some
systems it also reports memory usage, page faults, and other statistics.

</li><li><code>tput</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>tput</code> is a portable way for shell scripts to use special terminal
capabilities.  Our <code>tput</code> uses the Termcap database, instead of
Terminfo as most others do.

</li><li><b>UUCP</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

This version of UUCP was written by Ian Lance Taylor, and is GNU's standard
UUCP system.  It supports the <code>f</code>,
<code>g</code> and <code>v</code> (in all window and packet sizes),
<code>G</code>,
<code>t</code>,
<code>e</code>,
Zmodem and two new bidirectional
(<code>i</code> and <code>j</code>) protocols.  If you have a
Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  If you have TLI
libraries, it can make TLI connections.  Source is included for a Texinfo
manual, which is not yet published by the FSF.

</li><li><code>wdiff</code>         (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>wdiff</code> is a front-end to GNU <code>diff</code>.  It compares two files,
finding the words deleted or added to the first to make the
second.  It has many output formats and works well with terminals and pagers.
<code>wdiff</code> is very useful when two texts differ only by a few words and
paragraphs have been refilled.

</li><li><code>Ygl</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>Ygl</code> emulates SGI's GL (Graphics Language) library under X11.  It
runs under GNU/Linux with XFree, AIX 3.2, ConvexOS, HP-UX 7.0/8.0/9.0, SunOS
and many others.

<p>
The contents of the reel and various cartridge tapes for Unix systems are
the same (except for the RS/6000 Emacs tape, which also has executables for
Emacs); only the media are different.  For pricing information, see the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.
Source code for the manuals and reference cards is included
(see section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>).

</p>
<p>
Some of the files on the tapes may be compressed with <code>gzip</code> to
make them fit.  Refer to the top-level <tt>`README'</tt> file at the
beginning of each tape for instructions on uncompressing them.
<code>uncompress</code> and <code>unpack</code> <em>do not work</em>!

<h4 id="SEC28">Scheme Tape</h4>

<p>
Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed
at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming, and
to research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

</p>
<p>
This tape contains MIT Scheme 7.1, which conforms to the
"Revised^4 Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
(MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source is included.
It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries that can be used to bootstrap Scheme are available for:

</p>

<ul>
<li>HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700 &#38; 800 running HP-UX 7.0 or 8.0

</li><li>NeXT running NeXT OS 1.0 or 2.0

</li><li>Sun-3 or Sun-4 running SunOS 4.1

</li><li>DECstation 3100/5100 running Ultrix 4.0

</li><li>Sony NeWS-3250 running NEWS OS 5.01

</li><li>Vax running 4.3BSD

</li></ul>

<p>
If your system is not on this list and you don't enjoy the bootstrap
challenge, see the JACAL item in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC29">X11 Tapes</h4>

<p>
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 6 of the X Window System.
The first tape contains all of the core software, documentation and
some contributed clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is
necessary for running X or running GNU Emacs under X.  The second,
"optional" tape contains contributed libraries and other toolkits, the
Andrew User Interface System, games, and other programs.

</p>
<p>
The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released for programs on
both tapes.  See section <a href="#SEC46">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</a>.

</p>
<p>
We will distribute X11R5 on tape until X11R6 is stable, and on the
section <a href="#SEC40">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, while supplies last.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC30">Berkeley 4.4BSD--Lite Tape</h4>

<p>
The "4.4BSD--Lite" release is the latest from the Computer Systems
Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley.  It has most of
the BSD software system except for a few proprietary files that are in the
full 4.4BSD distribution.  It is much more complete than the previous
"Net2" release.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC31">VMS Emacs and VMS Compiler Tapes</h4>

<p>
We offer two VMS tapes.  One has just GNU Emacs 18.59 (none of the other
software on the section <a href="#SEC26">Lisps and Emacs Tape</a>, is included).  The other has GCC
2.3.3, Bison 1.19 (to compile GCC), GAS 1.38 (to assemble GCC's output) and
some library and include files (none of the other software on the
section <a href="#SEC25">Languages Tape</a>, is included).  We are not aware of a GDB port for
VMS.  Both VMS tapes have DEC VAX executables from which you can bootstrap,
as the DEC VMS C compiler cannot compile GCC.  We are not yet distributing
executables for DEC Alpha VMS systems.  Please do not ask us to devote
effort to VMS support, because it is peripheral to the GNU Project.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC32">CD-ROMs</h3>

<p>
We offer these CD-ROMs:

</p>

<ul>

<li>section <a href="#SEC34">MS-DOS CD-ROM</a>, expected in February 1995.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC35">Debian GNU/Linux CD-ROM</a>, expected in spring 1995.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC36">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC38">December 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC39">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC40">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li></ul>

<p>
Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format &#38; can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it you can mount each
CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions (the MS-DOS CD-ROM is only in ISO
9660 format) &#38; it will look just like an ordinary Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated &#38; otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</p>
<p>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</p>
<h4 id="SEC33">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the December 1994
Source CD costs $240.  It costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out
of your own pocket.  The December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

</p>

<p>
 
<b>What do the individual and company prices mean?</b>

</p>
<p>
The software on our disk is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</p>
<p>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the December 1994 Source CD-ROM, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same disk, we charge just $60.

</p>
<p>
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish, and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.

</p>
<p>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</p>
<p>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just 140 Source
CDs at that price supports an FSF programmer or tech writer for a year.

</p>
<p>
 
<b>Why is there an individual price?</b>

</p>
<p>
In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly, and decrease the software development we can do.

</p>
<p>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</p>
<p>
 
<b>Is there a maximum price?</b>

</p>
<p>
Our stated prices are minima.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept
as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt
public charity.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC34">MS-DOS CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We are releasing our first CD-ROM for MS-DOS in February 1995.  Contact
either address on
the top menu
for more information at that time.

</p>

The MS-DOS CD will be packaged inside a book describing its contents.
It will have all the sources and executables on the MS-DOS
Diskettes.  For details and version numbers, see section <a href="#SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC35">Debian GNU/Linux CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
Starting this spring, the FSF will be shipping a CD-ROM with Debian
GNU/Linux on it.  This CD will be packaged inside a book describing
its contents.

</p>
<p>
Debian GNU/Linux is a complete operating system for x86 machines,
available in both source code and binary form.  It is a GNU/Linux
system--that is to say, a variant GNU system which uses Linux as the
kernel.  (All the systems now available which use the Linux kernel
are GNU/Linux systems.)

</p>
<p>
Debian is being developed by Ian Murdock and the Debian Association in
conjunction with the Free Software Foundation.  We are distributing it
as an interim measure until the GNU kernel (the Hurd) is ready for
users.

</p>
<p>
Debian GNU/Linux is available
in <tt>`/pub/Linux/distributions/debian'</tt>
on the ftp site <code>sunsite.unc.edu</code>.
For more information
about the Debian Project and how to get involved, see
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/DEBIAN'</tt> on a GNU FTP host (see section <a href="#SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</a> for a list).

</p>


<h4 id="SEC36">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We are now offering a CD-ROM that contains executables for GNU compiler
tools for some systems which lack a compiler.
This enables the people who use these systems
to compile GNU and other free software without having to buy
a proprietary compiler.
You can also use the GNU compilation system to compile your own
C/C<tt>++</tt>/Objective-C programs.

</p>
<p>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

</p>

<p>
<b>These packages</b>:

</p>

<pre>
   * DJGPP 1.12.m2 from GCC 2.6.0

   * <code>sparc-sun-sunos4.1</code>
</pre>


<h4 id="SEC37">Source Code CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available:

</p>

<ul>

<li>section <a href="#SEC38">December 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC39">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC40">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li></ul>

<p>
The older Source Code CDs will be available while supplies last at a
reduced price; see the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
All of the Source Code CDs also contain Texinfo source for the <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite>, and other manuals listed in
section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>;
as well as a snapshot of the Emacs Lisp Archive at Ohio State University.
(You can get the libraries in this archive by
anonymous FTP from <code>archive.cis.ohio-state.edu</code> in
<tt>`/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive'</tt>.)

</p>
<p>
The VMS tapes' contents are <em>not</em> included.  Many programs that are
only on MS-DOS diskettes and not on the tapes are also <em>not</em> included.
The contents of the MIT Scheme &#38; X11 Optional tapes are <em>not</em> on the
November 1993 &#38; May 1994 Source CDs.  See section <a href="#SEC24">Tapes</a> &#38; section <a href="#SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</p>

<p>
There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the section <a href="#SEC36">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</h3>

<p>
The FSF distributes some of the GNU software ported to MS-DOS, on
3.5inch 1.44MB diskettes. These disks have both sources and
executables.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC42">DJGPP Diskettes</h4>

<p>
We offer DJGPP on 30 diskettes.  For further details, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.
The DJGPP diskettes contain the following:

</p>

<pre>
   *  bc 1.03
   *  Binutils 2.4
   *  Bison 1.22
   *  cpio 2.3
   *  Diffutils 2.6
   *  doschk 1.1
   *  Fileutils 3.9
   *  Findutils 3.8
   *  GAS 2.4
   *  Gawk 2.15.5
   *  GCC 2.6.0
   *  GDB 4.12
   *  Ghostscript 2.6.1
   *  Ghostview for Windows 1.0
   *  Groff 1.09
   *  gzip 1.24
   *  hello 1.3
   *  indent 1.9
   *  ispell 4.0
   *  m4 1.2

   *  shellutils 1.9
   *  Texinfo 3.1
   *  texutils 1.9
   *  wdiff 0.04
</pre>


<h4 id="SEC43">Emacs Diskettes</h4>

<p>
Two versions of GNU Emacs are included on the Emacs diskettes we
distribute: GNU Emacs version 19.26 handles 8-bit character sets; the
other, MULE version 2.1, handles 16-bit character sets including Kanji.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC44">Selected Utilities Diskettes</h4>

<p>
The GNUish MS-DOS Project ported GNU software to PC compatibles.  Though
the GNUish Project is no longer active, users still ask for these ports
that were done several years ago.  You can anonymous FTP files
<tt>`/pub/gnu/MicrosPorts/MSDOS*'</tt> from <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code> to
find out how to access these ports over the Internet.  We offer these
programs on five diskettes.  In general, this software will run on 8086 and
80286--based 16-bit machines; an 80386 is not required.  Some of these
utilities are necessarily missing features.

</p>
<p>
Included are:
<code>cpio</code>,
<code>diff</code>,
<code>find</code>,
<code>flex</code>,
<code>gdbm</code>,
<code>grep</code>,
<code>indent</code>,
<code>less</code>,
<code>m4</code>,
<code>make</code>,
<code>ptx</code>,
RCS,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>shar</code>,
<code>sort</code>,
&#38;
Texinfo.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC45">Windows Diskette</h4>

<p>
We offer GNU Chess and <code>gnuplot</code> for Microsoft Windows on a single
diskette.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC46">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</h3>

<p>
If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest GNU developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent
to three tapes or CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you
four new versions of the tape of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.
The tapes are sent each quarter; the CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued
(which is between two and four times a year.)

</p>
<p>
Regularly, we will send you a new version of an
Lisps/Emacs, Languages, Utilities, or X Window System (X11R6) Required tape
or the Source CD-ROM.  The MIT Scheme and X Window System Optional
tapes are not changed often enough to warrant quarterly updates.  We do not
yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools
Binaries or our new CD-ROMs.

</p>
<p>
Since Emacs 19 is on the Lisps/Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a
subscription to either is an easy way to keep current with Emacs 19 as it
evolves.

</p>
<p>
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the
X Window System.  We update the X11R6 Required tape as fixes and
patches are issued throughout the year.  Each new edition of the
section <a href="#SEC37">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>, also has updated sources for the X Window
System.

</p>
<p>
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're
in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you have
to add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "Unix and VMS Software" &#38;
"Shipping Instructions" on the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC47">The Deluxe Distribution</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source code, the
Deluxe Distribution includes a complete set of our printed manuals and
reference cards.

</p>
<p>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</p>
<p>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for any machine, with any operating
system.  We will send someone to your office to do the compilation, if we
can't find a suitable machine close to us!  However, we can only compile
the programs that already support your chosen machine and system  --
porting is a separate matter (if you wish to
commission a port, see the GNU Service Directory, details in section <a href="#SEC10">Free Software Support</a>).  Compiling all these programs take time; a Deluxe
Distribution for an unusual machine will take longer to produce then one
for a common machine.  Please contact the FSF office if you have any
questions.

</p>
<p>
We supply the software in one of these tape formats in Unix <code>tar</code>
format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge - QIC24,
Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridge,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in cartridge - QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm cartridge, or
DAT 4mm cartridge.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</p>
<p>
The manuals included are one each of the <cite>Bison</cite>, <cite>Calc</cite>,
<cite>Gawk</cite>, <cite>GNU C Compiler</cite>, <cite>GNU C Library</cite>, <cite>GDB</cite>,
<cite>Flex</cite>, <cite>GNU Emacs 19 Lisp Reference</cite>, <cite>Make</cite>,
<cite>Texinfo</cite>, &#38; <cite>Termcap</cite> manuals; six copies of the <cite>GNU Emacs
19</cite> manual; a packet of ten reference cards each for GNU Emacs, Bison,
Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB; and when it is available, a copy of the <cite>Programming in
Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite> manual.

</p>
<p>
Every Deluxe Distribution also includes a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs (including the MS-DOS CD &#38; the Debian GNU/Linux CD when they
are available) that contain sources of our software &#38; compiler tool
binaries for some systems.  The MS-DOS CD is in ISO 9660 format.  The other
CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</p>
<p>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"

<h3 id="SEC48">GNU Documentation</h3>

<p>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online and printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how
to use all the features of each program, and give examples of command use.
GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both
typeset hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system, and online
hypertext display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these
manuals comes with our software, but we publish some of them as printed
books as well; see the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <em>lay-flat</em>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  Each book has an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.  Currently, the <cite>GDB</cite>, <cite>Emacs</cite>, <cite>Programming in Emacs
Lisp, An Introduction</cite>, <cite>Emacs Lisp Reference</cite>, <cite>GAWK</cite>,
<cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Flex</cite>, <cite>Bison</cite>, and <cite>Texinfo</cite> manuals have
this binding.  The other GNU manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC
or Wire--O binding.  All of our manuals are 7in by 9.25in
except the 8.5in by 11in <cite>Calc</cite> manual.

</p>
<p>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</p>

<p>
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> (Edition 4.09 for Version 4.9) tells how to use
the GNU Debugger, run your program under debugger control, examine and
alter data, modify a program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU
Emacs.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Manual</cite> (10th Edition for Version 19.26) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and
regular expression search; how to use special modes for programming in
languages like C<tt>++</tt> and TeX; how to use the <code>tags</code> utility; how
to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and other
elementary customizations.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp, An Introduction</cite> is an elementary
introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp.  It is written for people
who are not programmers or not necessarily interested in
programming, but who do want to customize or extend their computing
environment.

</p>
<p>
It tells how to write programs that find files; shift buffers; use
searches, conditionals, loops, and recursion; how to write Emacs
initialization files; and how to run the Emacs Lisp debuggers.  If you read
the text in GNU Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs
directly.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 2.3 for Version 19.25)
covers this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GAWK Manual</cite> (Edition 0.16 for Version 2.16) tells how to use the
GNU implementation of <code>awk</code>.  It is written for those who have never
used <code>awk</code> and describes the features of this powerful string and
record manipulation language.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Make Manual</cite> (Edition 0.46 for Version 3.72) describes GNU
<code>make</code>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <em>makefiles</em>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Flex Manual</cite> (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <code>flex</code> program to create a
C<tt>++</tt> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</p>

<p>
The <cite>Bison Manual</cite> (December 1993 Edition for Version 1.23) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> (September 1994 Edition for Version 2.6)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<tt>++</tt>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Texinfo Manual</cite> (Edition 2.19 for Version 3) explains the markup
language used to generate both the online Info documentation and typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, how to use Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs, and
how to catch mistakes.  This second edition describes over 50 new commands.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Termcap Manual</cite> (2nd Edition for Version 1.2), often described as
"twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details the
format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal capabilities,
and the process of interrogating a terminal description.  This manual is
primarily for programmers.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>C Library Reference Manual</cite> (June 1993 Edition for Version 1.07)
describes most of the facilities of the GNU C library, including both what
Unix calls "library functions" and "system calls."  We are doing
limited copier runs of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please
send corrections and improvements to
<code>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Calc Manual</cite> (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

<h3 id="SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All the software and publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  The easiest way to
get GNU software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can get GNU software direct from the FSF by ordering diskettes, tapes,
or CD-ROMs.  Such orders provide most of the funds for the FSF staff to
develop more free software, so please support our work by ordering if you
can.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software; they do not
work with us, but can provide our software in other forms.  Some are listed
in section <a href="#SEC51">Free Software for Microcomputers</a>.  Please note that the Free
Software Foundation is <em>not</em> affiliated with them in any way and is
<em>not</em> responsible for either the currency of their versions or the
swiftness of their responses.

</p>
<p>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partially on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</p>
<p>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of FTP logins.  Please
use one of these other TCP/IP Internet sites that also provide GNU software
via anonymous FTP (program: <code>ftp</code>, user: <code>anonymous</code>,
password: <var>your e-mail address</var>, mode: <code>binary</code>).  If you have
FTP access but can't reach one of the hosts listed below, you can get the
software via FTP the same way from GNU's main FTP host,
<code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code> (IP address is <code>18.71.0.38</code>).  For more
details &#38; additional hosts, get the files

<h3 id="SEC53">Project GNU Wish List</h3>

<p>
Wishes for this issue are for:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Volunteers to distribute this Bulletin at technical conferences, trade
shows, local and national user group meetings, etc.  Volunteers to get GNU
articles into their user group newsletters.  Please phone or fax the
numbers on
the top menu,
or email <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code> to make
arrangements.

</li><li>

Boston area volunteers for various tasks in the business and programming
offices.
Please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li>

Volunteers to help write programs and documentation.  Send mail to
<code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code> for the task list and coding standards.

</li><li>

Volunteers to build binaries for systems not yet on the
section <a href="#SEC36">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>
(especially for systems that don't come with a C compiler).
Please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li>

Oleo extensions and other free software for business, such as accounting
and project management programs.

</li><li>

600<tt>+</tt> megabyte SCSI disks to give us more space to develop software.

</li><li>

Pentium, 486, or 386 PC compatibles with 200<tt>+</tt> MB of disk &#38; Ethernet
cards.

</li><li>

Pentium, 486, or 386 PC laptops.

</li><li>

High end HP-300 workstations.
Sixteen or thirty-two 1 Meg SIMMs for a Sun 4/110.
A Sun SPARCstation and a Sun-3/60 or 4/110.

</li><li>

SCSI tape drives for 4mm DAT cartridge tapes, 8mm Exabyte
cartridge tapes and 1600 or 6250bpi 1/2inch reel to reel tapes.

</li><li>

Companies to lend us capable programmers and technical writers for at
least six months.  True wizards may be welcome for shorter periods, but
we have found that six months is the minimum time for a good programmer
to finish a worthwhile project.

</li><li>

Professors who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting research
assistants to do GNU development, with FSF support.

</li><li>

Speech and character recognition software and systems (if the devices
aren't too weird), with the device drivers if possible.  This would help
the productivity of partially disabled people (including a few we know).

</li><li>

New quotes and ideas for articles in the GNU's Bulletin.  We particularly
like to highlight organizations involved with free information exchanges,
software that uses the GNU General Public License, and companies providing
free software support as a primary business.

</li><li>

Information about free software or developers of free software that we may
not know about.  Often, we only find out about interesting projects because
a user writes and asks us why we have not mentioned those projects!

</li><li>

Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU Project or GNU
software.  Send these to the address on
the top menu,
or send a citation
to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li>

Money.

If you use and appreciate our software, please send a contribution.  One
way to help us defray our costs is to order a distribution tape, diskette,
or CD-ROM.  A business can make a larger contribution by ordering a
section <a href="#SEC47">The Deluxe Distribution</a>.  This is especially helpful if you work for a
business where the word "donation" is anathema.
Because of the value received, the full dollar amounts of such donations are
not tax deductible as charitable contributions; however, they may qualify
as a business expense.
