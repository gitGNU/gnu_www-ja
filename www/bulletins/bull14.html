<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="bull14.html#TOC4">What Is the Free Software Foundation?</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating
restrictions on people's abilities and rights to copy, redistribute,
understand, and modify computer programs.  We do this by promoting the
development and use of free software in all areas of computer use.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete integrated software
system named "GNU" (GNU's Not Unix) that will be upwardly
compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are already
working, and we are distributing them now.

</P>
<P>
The word "free" in our name pertains to freedom, not price.  You may or
may not pay money to get GNU software.  Either way, you have two specific
freedoms once you have the software: first, the freedom to copy the program
and give it away to your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to
change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code.
Furthermore, you can study the source and learn how such programs are
written.  You may then be able to port it, improve it, and share your
changes with others.  If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a
fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, or you may give away
copies.

</P>
<P>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need for you to purchase a proprietary
system.

</P>
<P>
Besides developing GNU, FSF distributes copies of GNU software and
manuals for a distribution fee, and accepts tax-deductible gifts to
support GNU development.  Most of FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.  We are tax exempt; you can deduct donations to us on your
U.S. tax returns.

</P>
<P>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President; <BR>
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="bull14.html#TOC5">What Is Copyleft?</A></H1>

<P>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public
domain, uncopyrighted.  But this allows anyone to copyright and restrict
its use against the author's wishes, thus denying others the right to
access and freely redistribute it.  This completely perverts the
original intent.

</P>
<P>
To prevent this, we copyright our software and manuals in a novel
manner.  Typical software companies use copyrights to take away your
freedoms.  We use the <EM>copyleft</EM> to preserve them.  It is a legal
instrument that requires those who pass on the program to include the
rights to further redistribute it, and to see and change the code; the
code and rights become legally inseparable.

</P>
<P>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from a combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <EM>GNU General Public License</EM> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says (in several pages of
legalese) that you have the freedoms discussed above.  An alternate
form, the <EM>GNU Library General Public License</EM> (LGPL), applies to
certain GNU Libraries.  This license permits linking the libraries into
proprietary executables under certain conditions.  The appropriate
license is included in all GNU source code distributions and in many of
our manuals.  We will also send you a copy.  Please send your request to
either address on the front cover.

</P>

<P>
Note that the library license actually represents a strategic retreat.
We would prefer to insist as much as possible that programs based on GNU
software must themselves be free.  However, in the case of
libraries, we found that insisting they be used only in free software
appeared to discourage use of the libraries rather than encouraging
free applications.

</P>
<P>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either license appear at the end of each license.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="bull14.html#TOC6">LGPL Query</A></H3>

<P>
Both <CODE>libg<TT>++</TT></CODE> and <CODE>libc</CODE> are covered by the Library
General Public License.  Do you use either of these libraries in a
proprietary application under the terms of the LGPL?  We would like to
know to help evaluate whether the LGPL is doing the job it was designed
to do.  Please send mail to <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>, or to
the postal address on the front cover of this Bulletin.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="bull14.html#TOC7">Free Software Support</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide any technical support.
Although we create software, we leave it to others to earn a living
providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much as
doctors and lawyers now do; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable entities for which the practitioners charge a
distribution and service fee.

</P>
<P>
We maintain a list of people who offer support and other consulting
services, called the GNU Service Directory.  It is in the file
<TT>`etc/SERVICE'</TT> in the GNU Emacs distribution, <TT>`SERVICE'</TT> in the
GCC distribution, and <TT>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE'</TT> on
<CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  Contact us if you would like a printed copy
or wish to be listed in it.

</P>
<P>
If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.  We have
many Internet mailing lists for announcements, bug reports, and
questions.  They are also gatewayed into USENET news as the <CODE>gnu.*</CODE>
newsgroups.  You can get a list of the mailing lists available by
mailing your request to either address on the front cover.

</P>
<P>
If you have no Internet access, you can get mail and USENET news via
UUCP.  Contact a local UUCP site, or a commercial UUCP site such as:

</P>

<PRE>
UUNET Communications Services,
3110 Fairview Park Drive - Suite 570,
Falls Church, VA   22042
USA
Phone: (703) 876-5050
E-mail: <CODE>info@uunet.uu.net</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
A list of commercial uucp and networking providers is posted
periodically to USENET in newsgroup <CODE>news.announce.newusers</CODE> with
Subject: <TT>`How to become a USENET site'</TT>.

</P>

<P>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While
our bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not.  Our
task is so large that we must focus on that which helps the community as
a whole.  We do not have the resources to help individuals.  We may send
you a patch for a bug that helps us test the fix and ensure its quality.
If your bug report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get
one from another user who reads our bug report mailing lists.
Otherwise, use the Service Directory.

</P>
<P>
So, please do not ask us to help you install the software or figure out
how to use it--but do tell us how an installation script does not work
or where the documentation is unclear.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="bull14.html#TOC8">Free Software Support Far From Home</A></H3>

<P>
Here are some free software support companies that we have not mentioned
before.  We urge you to employ support service companies such as these,
because you help the industry as well as yourself by getting your pick
of support vendors.  The FSF is not affiliated with any of these
companies.  For the addresses of other support companies, please consult
the Service Directory.

<B>From the Far East . . . </B>

People in Japan can now contact a local company for GNU software support.  The
company is named Wingnut (Fax only: <TT>+</TT>81-3-3954-5174).  The
organizers were inspired by the GNU Manifesto.  Wingnut provides two
services: porting and customizing GNU software, and answering technical
questions (including how to install the software).  Wingnut also
helped support the recent GNU Technical Seminar in Tokyo.

Signum Support AB, in Linkoping, Sweden, is a software company
that supports free software.  It has experience in such
diverse areas as compiler internals, computer graphics, version control
systems, and networking.

The company can provide precompiled, ready-to-install binaries along
with the source (currently only for Sun-3 and Sun-4), and it offers a
subscription service for new versions which can be sent monthly or at
any other interval.

Signum also specializes in finding, investigating, and
recommending other free software in any area of the customer's choice.

Signum's service costs vary.  The consulting cost ranges from
400-600 SEK/hour.  You can contact Signum Support AB as follows:

<LI><B>Conference in GNU Russia</B>

A conference on Free Software will take place in Moscow from April
19 through 23, 1993.  See the article "Moscow Free Software Conference".

<LI><B>Compress Suppressed</B>

<CODE>gzip</CODE> is the GNU replacement for <CODE>compress</CODE>.  It is currently
in beta release.  <CODE>gzip</CODE> compresses much more than <CODE>compress</CODE>
does; a file compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE> is usually two thirds the size
of a file compressed with <CODE>compress</CODE>.  Additionally, although
<CODE>gzip</CODE> is slower than <CODE>compress</CODE>, <CODE>gunzip</CODE> is faster than
<CODE>uncompress</CODE>.  This is important for the users of software
distributions.

<LI><B>Free Software Association of Germany</B>

The Free Software Association of Germany (FSAG) is a group of people
developing free software.  However, they also want to support the Free
Software Foundation.  They have offered to sell FSF tapes through their
offices and send the proceeds to the FSF.

You can order FSF tapes and manuals from FSAG at:

<H1><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="bull14.html#TOC12">Andrew Toolkit Stays Free</A></H1>

<P>
The Andrew Toolkit is both an extensible, object-oriented toolkit for
graphical user interfaces and a package of applications.  The most
widely-used application is the Andrew Message System (AMS).  The Toolkit
is distributed on the GNU Project's "optional" X Windows tape, and the
GNU Project's Source Code CD-ROM.

</P>
<P>
Not long ago, several people asked whether the Toolkit would stay free.
It will.  The Andrew Toolkit Consortium plans to continue to make
versions of the Toolkit and the AMS freely usable and distributable.
However, there is (as there always has been) a catch: members of the
Consortium get updates sooner and more frequently than the rest of us.
This provides Consortium members with another incentive to continue as
members.

<H1><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="bull14.html#TOC13">GNU Zip to Replace Compress</A></H1>

<P>
by Richard Stallman

</P>
<P>
We finally have a data compression program that is as good as
<CODE>compress</CODE> (actually, somewhat better) and patent-free for the moment.
It is called <CODE>gzip</CODE> and was written by Jean-Loup Gailly,
<CODE>jloup@chorus.fr</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When compressing, <CODE>gzip</CODE> produces a new format all its own.  We
cannot implement <CODE>compress</CODE>-compatible compression because of the
LZW algorithm patents.  However, the patents do not prohibit
uncompression, so <CODE>gzip</CODE> is designed to recognize and properly
uncompress files that were made by <CODE>compress</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>gzip</CODE> uses the file suffix <TT>`.z'</TT> for compressed files.  We
chose this because GNU programs such as GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> and the Emacs 19
Dired mode use <SAMP>`z'</SAMP> as an option or command pertaining to
compression, and these would be less natural and harder to remember if
compressed files did not have <SAMP>`z'</SAMP> in their names.  This suffix
conflicts with the <CODE>compact</CODE> program, but this does not seem to be
a big problem; distribution of <CODE>compact</CODE> files is not widespread.

</P>
<P>
We are gradually converting our FTP distribution files on
<CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> to use <CODE>gzip</CODE>.  We hope to stop distribution of
<CODE>compress</CODE> soon.  In the GNU system, we plan to make the
<CODE>compress</CODE> command run <CODE>gzip</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
While we think <CODE>gzip</CODE> does not infringe any patents we know of, it is
always possible it infringes others we have not heard about.  Even if it
is patent-free today, new software patents are issued every day, and one
covering <CODE>gzip</CODE> may be issued at any moment.  In September 1991, when
we were a week away from releasing another data compression program, a
patent was issued which covered the algorithm that it used.  We never
released that program.

</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, patents endanger any software development activity, and
you cannot effectively protect yourself from them except through
political action to change the law in your country and elsewhere.  The
author of <CODE>compress</CODE> and the author of the program we almost used
in 1991 have both joined the LPF.

<B>GNU Software Configuration Scheme</B>

We now have a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages in
order to compile them.  This makes it possible to configure all GNU
software in the same way.  In particular, all GNU software will support
the same alternatives for naming machine types and system types.

The configuration scheme also supports configuring a directory
that contains several GNU packages with one command.  When we have a
complete system, this will make it possible to configure the entire
system at once, eliminating the need to learn how to configure each of
the individual packages that make up the GNU system.

For tools used in compilation, the configuration scheme also lets you
specify both the host system and the target system, so you can configure
and build cross-compilation tools easily.

GCC version 2 and GDB version 4 support the new configuration scheme, as
do most of our other programs and collections (Emacs 19 will also
support it).  The main exception now is Emacs version 18.

<LI>

<B>The Hurd</B>

We are developing the GNU Hurd, a set of servers that run on top of
Mach.  Mach is a free message-passing kernel being developed by CMU.
The Hurd servers, in combination with the GNU C Library, provide
Unix-like functionality.  Together with Mach they are the last major
components necessary for a complete GNU system.  Currently there are
free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC and the DEC PMAX
workstation.  (The PMAX is one kind of MIPS-based DECstation.)  Other
free ports of Mach are in progress.  Contact CMU for more information if
you want to help with one of those or start one of your own.  Porting
the GNU Hurd is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting GCC) once a Mach port to a particular kind of hardware
exists.

There are some large projects relating to the Hurd that can be done by
volunteers.  Those who can read and understand the source code with
fewer than two questions, and have the time for a large project, are
invited to make themselves known to Michael Bushnell.

<LI>

<B>GNU Emacs</B>

Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor.  GNU Emacs 18.59 is the current version.
Emacs 18 maintenance continues for simple bug fixes.

Version 19 is being pretested.  Its new features include:


<UL>

<LI>before and after change hooks

<LI>source-level debugging of Emacs Lisp programs

<LI>support for European character sets

<LI>floating point numbers

<LI>improved buffer allocation, using a new mechanism capable of

returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed

<LI>simplified and improved processing of function keys, mouse clicks,

and mouse movement

<LI>multiple X windows (`frames' to Emacs), with a separate X window

for the minibuffer or with a minibuffer attached to each X window

<LI>X selection processing, including CLIPBOARD selections

<LI>popup menus defined by keymaps

<LI>interfacing with the X resource manager

<LI>scrollbars

<LI>support for the GNU configuration scheme

</UL>

Thanks go to Alan Carroll and the people who worked on Epoch for
generating initial feedback to a multi-windowed Emacs.

Other features under consideration for later releases of Version 19
include:


<UL>
<LI>associating property lists with regions of text in a buffer

<LI>multiple font, color, and pixmaps defined by those properties

<LI>different visibility conditions for the regions, and for various

windows showing one buffer

<LI>hooks to be run if point or mouse moves outside a certain range

<LI>incrementally saving the undo history in a file, so that

<CODE>recover-file</CODE> also reinstalls the buffer's undo history

<LI>static menu bars

</UL>

<LI>

<B>C Compiler</B>

GCC supports both ANSI standard and traditional C, as well as the GNU
extensions to C.  Two versions of GCC are being maintained in parallel.
Version 1 is stable, but is still maintained with bug fixes.  For more
information about version 1, see "Contents of the Languages Tape."

Version 2 of GCC is in late beta test and is getting close to being
reliable.  It includes front ends for the languages C<TT>++</TT> and
Objective C.

New front ends are being developed, but they are not part of GCC yet.  A
front end for Fortran is in alpha test.  A front end for Ada is being
funded through the Ada 9X standards committee.  Since it is a quite
complex language, we expect completion to take a while.  Volunteers are
also developing front ends for Modula-3 and Pascal.  There are mumblings
about other languages, but no one has volunteered to do Cobol yet.  For
more information about version 2, see "Contents of the Experimental
Tape."

<LI>

<B>Binutils</B>

Steve Chamberlain, Per Bothner, and others at Cygnus Support have
rewritten the binary utilities (including the linker).  Version 2.0 is
based on the same Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library used by GDB.  All
the tools can be run on a host that differs from the target (e.g.
cross-linking is supported).  Furthermore, various forms of COFF and
other object file formats are supported.  A tool can now deal with
object files in multiple formats all at once.  For example, the linker can
read object files using two different formats, and write the output in a
third format.  The linker interprets a superset of the AT&#38;T Linker
Command Language, which allows very general control over where segments
are placed in memory.

Improvements planned for release 2.1 include better Posix-compatible
archive handling and reduced memory use by the executables.

<LI>

<B>GAS using BFD is on its way</B>

This will complete the support for various object file formats.
Sometime before that there will be a bug-fix release of GAS.

<LI>

<B>GNU C Library</B>

Roland McGrath continues to work on the GNU C Library.  It now conforms
to ANSI C-1989 and POSIX 1003.1-1990, and work is in progress on POSIX
1003.2 and Unix functions (BSD and System V).  In the Hurd, the C
Library will do much of what the system calls do in Unix.  Mike Haertel
has written a fast <CODE>malloc</CODE> which wastes less memory than the old
GNU <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  The GNU regular-expression functions (<CODE>regex</CODE>)
now mostly conform to the POSIX 1003.2 standard, and a new, faster regex
implementation should be ready soon.

GNU <CODE>stdio</CODE> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <CODE>fmemopen</CODE> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <CODE>printf</CODE> formats to use a C function you have written.  Also,
you can safely use format strings from user input to implement a
<CODE>printf</CODE>-like function for another programming language, for
example.  Extended <CODE>getopt</CODE> functions are already used to parse
options, including long options, in many GNU utilities.
The current version is 1.05.  Version 1.06 will include complete support
for SVR4 and Solaris 2, and better support for Linux.  For more
information, see "Contents of Experimental Tape."

The <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> describes all the library
facilities, including both what Unix calls "library functions" and
"system calls."  It is new, and we would like corrections and
improvements.  Please send them to
<CODE>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  We won't print this manual
on paper until it is more stable.

<LI>

<B>JACAL</B>

Aubrey Jaffer has written JACAL, a symbolic mathematics system for the
simplification and manipulation of equations and single- and multiple-valued
algebraic expressions constructed of numbers, variables,
radicals, and algebraic functions, differential operators, and holonomic
functions.  In addition, vectors and matrices of the above objects are
included.

JACAL is written in Scheme.  An IEEE P1178 and R4RS compliant version of
Scheme ("SCM") written in C is available with JACAL.  SCM runs on Amiga,
Atari-ST, MS-DOS, NOS/VE, VMS, Unix, and similar systems.  SLIB is a
portable Scheme library that JACAL uses.  JACAL, SLIB, and SCM sources are
available via anonymous FTP from <CODE>altdorf.ai.mit.edu</CODE> in
<TT>`/archive/scm'</TT> or <CODE>nexus.yorku.ca</CODE> in
<TT>`/pub/scheme/new'</TT>.

The FSF is not distributing JACAL on tape yet.  To receive an IBM PC
floppy disk with the source and executable files, send $99.00 to:

<CODE>make</CODE>

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> version 3.63 has just been released.  New features
include a standard GNU <CODE>configure</CODE> script, long option support,
more flexible environment variable support, and an improved
<CODE>include</CODE> directive.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> is fully compliant with the
POSIX.2 standard, and also supports parallel command execution, flexible
implicit pattern rules, conditional execution, and powerful text
manipulation functions.

<B>Oleo</B>

Oleo is a spreadsheet program.  It still needs documentation.  If you
would like to write a Texinfo manual for Oleo, contact Tom Lord,
<CODE>lord+@andrew.cmu.edu</CODE>.  Please send bug reports regarding
Oleo to <CODE>bug-oleo@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  For more information, see
"Contents of Experimental Tape."

<LI>

<B>finger</B>

Originally, each host on the Internet consisted of a single,
reasonably powerful computer, capable of handling many users at the same
time.  Typically, a <EM>site</EM> (a physical location of computer users)
would have only one or two computers, even if they had 20 or more people
who used them.  If a user at site A wanted to know about users logged on
at site B, a simple program could be invoked to query the host at site B
about the users who were logged on.

With the onset of more-power-per-person computing, the mainframe has
been set aside.  A modern computing facility usually consists of one
user per host, and many hosts per site.  This makes it a trial to find
out about logged-on users at another site, since you must query each
host to find out about the single user who is logged on.

GNU Finger is a simple and effective way around this problem, and
serves as a direct replacement for existing finger programs.  For sites
with many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger
<EM>server</EM> host.  This host collects information about who is logged
on to other hosts at that site.  If a user at site A wants to know about
users logged on at site B, only the server host need be queried, instead
of each host at that site.  This is very convenient.
(See "Contents of the Utilities Tape".)

<LI>

<B>Ghostscript</B>

The current version of Ghostscript is 2.5.2.  Features include the
ability to specify device resolution and output file (including piping)
from the command line; many new output devices and file formats,
including PBM/PGM/PPM, GIF, and PCX; many more Postscript Level 2
facilities; improved character rendering; and incorporation of the
standard Adobe font metrics into the Ghostscript fonts.

Ghostscript 2.5.2 accepts commands in Postscript and executes them by
drawing on an X window, writing to a file that you can print later, or
writing directly to a printer.  Volunteer Tim Theisen,
<CODE>ghostview@cs.wisc.edu</CODE>, has created a previewer for
multi-page files, called Ghostview, on top of Ghostscript.

Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also
supports IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA, or SuperVGA graphics
(but do not ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use
PCs).

<LI>

<B>Smalltalk</B>

GNU Smalltalk implements the traditional features of the Smalltalk
language, but not the graphics and window features.  Recently someone
has implemented these and they will appear in a future release.

<LI>

<B><CODE>groff</CODE></B>

James Clark has completed <CODE>groff</CODE> (GNU <CODE>troff</CODE> and related
programs).  Version 1.06 is now available (see "Contents of the
Utilities Tape").  <CODE>groff</CODE> is written in C<TT>++</TT>.  It can be
compiled with GNU C<TT>++</TT> Version 2.3 or later.

Bugs in <CODE>groff</CODE> will be fixed, but no major new developments are
currently planned.  However, <CODE>groff</CODE> users are encouraged to
continue to contribute enhancements.  Most needed are complete Texinfo
documentation, a <CODE>grap</CODE> emulation (a <CODE>pic</CODE> preprocessor for
typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar to <CODE>pm</CODE>
(see <CITE>Computing Systems</CITE>, Vol. 2, No. 2), and an ASCII output class
for <CODE>pic</CODE> so that <CODE>pic</CODE> can be integrated with Texinfo.

Thanks to all those who have contributed bug reports.

<LI>

<B>Texinfo 2</B>

The Texinfo 2 package includes an enhanced Texinfo mode for GNU Emacs,
new versions of the formatting utilities, and the second edition of
<CITE>Texinfo</CITE> (which is more thorough than the first edition and
describes over 50 new commands).  Texinfo mode now includes commands for
automatically creating and updating nodes and menus, a tedious task when
done by hand.  The package includes <CODE>makeinfo</CODE>, a standalone
formatter, and <CODE>info</CODE>, a standalone Info reader.  Both are written
in C and are independent of GNU Emacs.

<LI>

<B>GNU Chess</B>

GNU Chess is a program that plays chess with you.  The program is
written entirely in the C language and has been ported to the PC, the
Cray-2, and numerous other machines.  It has also been ported to other
operating systems, including Windows and MS-DOS, though these versions
are not being supported by the maintainer.

GNU Chess implements many specialized features including the null move
heuristic, a hash table with aging, the history heuristic (another form
of the earlier killer heuristic), caching of static evaluations, a
sophisticated database which lets the program play the first several
moves in the game quickly, and so forth.

The program recently won the Uniform Platform event in London, England.
This is unusual for a source-available program.  The event tests
algorithms only, as all chess program entrants ran on identical hardware.

GNU Chess is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft
on behalf of the Free Software Foundation.

<B>GNU Fortran (<CODE>g77</CODE>)</B>

GNU Fortran is in "private" alpha test (testing by a small
group of experts) and is not yet publicly released.

The primary focus of the alpha test is to test the <CODE>g77</CODE> front end,
since that has most of the new code.  The secondary focus of the alpha
test is to test the integration between the front end and the back end.
Currently, this is where most of the bugs seem to be.  The tertiary
focus is the quality of code generated by the GNU back end.

A mailing list exists for those interested in the Fortran front end for
GCC.  To subscribe, ask:

<B>Porting</B>

Although we do not yet have a complete GNU system, it is already possible

<B>Project Gutenberg</B>

Project Gutenberg is the brainchild of Michael Hart.  Back in 1971, he
decided to use extra computer time to type in copyright-free articles,
and he has not stopped since.  What started with the Declaration of
Independence has grown to include text ranging from the King James
version of the Bible, to <CITE>The Scarlet Letter</CITE>, to data from the 1990
U.S. Census.

Professor Hart's hope for ultimate success derives from the nature of
what he calls `Replicator Technology': once anything is stored in a
computer, it can be reproduced indefinitely, making it available to all
who want it.

Texts from Project Gutenberg are available at a number of FTP sites,
including <CODE>mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu</CODE> (in <TT>`/etext'</TT>) and
<CODE>oes.orst.edu</CODE> (filename <TT>`/pub/almanac/etext'</TT>).  For

features it provides will be merged into the FSF version of Emacs.
Ken'ichi Handa, <CODE>handa@etl.go.jp</CODE>, is beta testing MULE; you
can FTP sources from <CODE>sh.wide.ad.jp:/JAPAN/mule</CODE> or
<CODE>etlport.etl.go.jp:/pub/mule</CODE>.

A group connected with the commercial personal computer network in Japan
is writing and distributing a copylefted hardware (circuit diagram)
design and associated software that uses a MIPS-architecture based CPU.
The OS which runs on this machine, <CODE>t2</CODE>, is a subset of Unix that
uses GCC and GDB as the system's compiler and debugger.  They are also
running MIPS-BSD, which is based on both the 386BSD and Mach kernels.

<P>
Many groups in Japan distribute GNU
software, including JUG (a PC user group), Nikkei Business
Publications and ASCII (publishers), and the Fujitsu FM Towns users
group.  Anonymous UUCP is also now available in Japan; for more

You can also order GNU software directly from the FSF--indeed, we
encourage you to do so: every 150 tape orders allows FSF to hire a
programmer for a year to create more free software.

<H1><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="bull14.html#TOC20">GNU Technical Seminar in Tokyo</A></H1>

<P>
The FSF, together with the Software Engineers Association of Japan (SEA)
and the Japan Unix Society (JUS), sponsored a GNU Technical Seminar in
Tokyo on December 2 and 3, 1992.  The speakers were Richard Stallman,
Michael Bushnell, and Ken'ichi Handa.  Bob Myers and David Littleboy
translated the English talks into Japanese.  Software Research
Associates, Inc. provided help in countless ways.  The FSF also unveiled
both the newly released GNU Source Code CD-ROM and the new GNU T-shirts.

</P>
<P>
Over 130 people attended the seminar and many members of the Japanese
press interviewed Richard Stallman.  (Look for a cover story in an
upcoming issue of Asahi Pasocon.)  We are considering more seminars both
in Japan and elsewhere if there is sufficient interest in any one
region.

</P>
<P>
The FSF had a booth and a visible presence at the Japan Unix Society
Fair '92 held in Yokohama from December 9 through 11.  JUS
provided the booth, and JUS volunteers pitched in to help staff it.
This was so successful we hope to appear at other Unix events in Japan
in the future.

</P>
<P>
On December 10, Richard Stallman gave a talk at Toshiba Corporation
which was attended by 70 people.  The following day, he spoke at
Aoyama Gakuin University.

</P>
<P>
Both the seminar and the booth succeeded beyond our expectations.  We
received many unsolicited donations from individual supporters and
users' groups, and were surprised and pleased by the number
of the enthusiastic
volunteers who came forward to help us at our various events.

arrangements.

<LI>

600 Megabyte (or larger) SCSI disk drives to give us more space to
develop our software.

<LI>

A 386 or 486 PC compatible with at least 200 Megabytes of hard disk and
an Ethernet card.

<LI>

A 4 mm DAT tape drive, an Exabyte tape drive, a Sun SPARCstation, and a
Sun-3/60.

<LI>

Companies to lend us capable programmers and technical writers for at
least six months.  True wizards may be welcome for shorter periods, but
we have found that six months is the minimum time for a good programmer
to finish a worthwhile project.

<LI>

Professors who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting research
assistants to do GNU development, with FSF support.

<LI>

Volunteers to help write programs and documentation.  Send mail to
<CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> for the task list and coding
standards.

<LI>

Speech and character recognition software and systems (if the devices
aren't too weird), with the device drivers if possible.  This would help
the productivity of partially disabled people (including a few we know).

<LI>

New quotes and ideas for articles in the GNU's Bulletin.  We
particularly like to highlight organizations involved with free
information exchange and companies providing free software support as a
primary business.

<LI>

Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU Project or
GNU software.  Send these to the address on the front cover, or send a

<B>GNU Emacs</B> 18.59

In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
customizable real-time display editor.  GNU Emacs is his second
implementation.  It's the first Emacs for Unix systems that offers true
Lisp--smoothly integrated into the editor--for writing extensions, and
provides an interface to MIT's X Window System.  In addition to its
powerful native command set, extensions which emulate other popular
editors are distributed: vi, EDT (DEC's VMS editor), and Gosling (aka
Unipress) Emacs.  It has many other features, which make it a full
computing support environment.  It is described by the <CITE>GNU Emacs</CITE>
manual, the <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</CITE> manual, and a reference
card.  Source for all three come with the software.

GNU Emacs 18.59 runs on many Unix systems (arranged by hardware): Alliant

<B>GNU Calc</B> 2.02

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible,
advanced desk calculator and mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU
Emacs.  It comes with source for the <CITE>Calc</CITE> manual, which serves as
a tutorial and reference.  If you wish, you can use Calc only as a
simple four-function calculator, but it provides additional features
including choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry, logarithmic
functions, trigonometric and financial functions, arbitrary precision,
complex numbers, vectors, matrices, dates, times, infinities, sets,
algebraic simplification, differentiation, and integration.

<LI>

<B>MIT Scheme</B> 7.0

Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was
designed at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of
programming and to research new parallel programming constructs and
compilation techniques.  MIT Scheme is written in C and the interpreter
runs on many Unix systems.  It conforms to the "Revised^3 Report On the
Algorithmic Language Scheme" (MIT AI Lab Memo 848a), for which TeX
source is included.

<LI>

<B>Yale T</B> 3.1

T is a variant of Scheme developed at Yale University; it is intended
for production use in program development.  T contains a native-code
optimizing compiler that produces code that runs at speeds comparable to
the speeds of programs written in conventional languages.  It runs on
BSD VAXen, 680x0 systems, SPARCs, and MIPS R2000 workstations (including
the DECstation 3100), &#38; NS32000 machines (including the Encore
Multimax).  T is written in itself and cannot be bootstrapped without a
binary (which is included), but it is great if you can use it.  Some
documentation is included.

<LI>

<B>CLISP</B> 1993.01.01

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
It mostly conforms to the version of Common Lisp described by
<CITE>Common LISP: The Language (1st edition)</CITE>.  CLISP runs on many
microcomputers including the Atari ST, Amiga 500-2000, most MS-DOS
systems, and OS/2) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, SunOS
(SPARC), Sun386, HP-UX (HP 9000/800), and others) and needs only 1.5 MB
of memory.  CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler and, for some
machines, a screen editor.

<B>PCL</B> 92.12.08

PCL is a freely available implementation of a large subset of CLOS, the
Common Lisp Object System.  PCL was written by Xerox Corporation.

<LI>

<B><CODE>gzip</CODE></B> 0.6

Some of the contents of our tape distribution is compressed.  We include
software on the tapes to compress/decompress these files.  Due to patent
troubles with <CODE>compress</CODE>, we are switching to another compression
program, <CODE>gzip</CODE>.  <CODE>gzip</CODE> can uncompress LZW-compressed files
but uses a different algorithm for compression which generally produces
better results.  It is presently in beta test but we hope people will
begin using it.  This year we are converting all our compressed
distribution files on <CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>, as well as our
distribution tapes.

<LI>

<B><CODE>make</CODE></B> 3.63

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> has nearly all the features of the BSD and System V
versions of <CODE>make</CODE>, as well as many of our own extensions.  It
complies with POSIX 1003.2.  GNU extensions include parallel
compilation, conditional execution, and text manipulation.  Source for
the <CITE>Make</CITE> manual comes with the program.

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> is distributed on several of the tapes because native
<CODE>make</CODE> programs lack essential features for using the GNU configure
system to its full extent.

<LI>

<B>Texinfo</B> 2.16

Texinfo is a set of utilities which generate printed manuals and online
hypertext-style manuals (called "Info").  The late beta test Texinfo 2
package contains enhancements to the current suite and source for the
<CITE>Texinfo</CITE> manual.

Texinfo is distributed on several of the tapes to insure that it is
possible to rebuild and read info files for various programs.

<B>GCC</B> 1.42

The GNU C compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which
performs automatic register allocation, common sub-expression
elimination, invariant code motion from loops, induction variable
optimizations, constant propagation and copy propagation, delayed
popping of function call arguments, tail recursion elimination,
integration of inline functions, and frame pointer elimination, plus
many local optimizations that are automatically deduced from the machine
description.

GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C, and GNU C extensions.  It
generates good code for the 32000, 680x0, 80386, Alliant, Convex, Tahoe
&#38; VAX CPUs, and for these RISC CPUs: i860, Pyramid, SPARC, &#38; SPUR.  The
MIPS RISC CPU is also supported.  Other supported systems include
(arranged by hardware): 386 (AIX), Alliant FX/8, Altos 3068, Apollo
68000/68020 (Aegis), AT&#38;T 3B1, Convex C1 &#38; C2, DECstation 3100 &#38; 5000,

Source for the GCC manual, <CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE>, is included
with the compiler.  The manual describes how to run and install the GNU
C compiler, and how to port it to new systems.  It describes new
features and incompatibilities of the compiler, but people not familiar
with C will also need a good reference on the C programming language.

<LI>

<B>G<TT>++</TT></B> 1.42.0

G<TT>++</TT> is a set of changes for GCC version 1 which supports C<TT>++</TT>.
As far as possible, G<TT>++</TT> is kept compatible with the evolving draft
ANSI standard, but not with <CODE>cfront</CODE> (the AT&#38;T compiler), as
<CODE>cfront</CODE> has been diverging from ANSI.  G<TT>++</TT> comes with source
for the <CITE>GNU G<TT>++</TT> User's Guide</CITE> (not yet published on paper).
G<TT>++</TT> compiles source quickly, provides good error messages, and works
well with GDB.  As G<TT>++</TT> depends on GCC, it must be used with a
specific numbered version of GCC.

<LI>

<B>libg<TT>++</TT></B> 1.39.0

The GNU C<TT>++</TT> library, libg<TT>++</TT>, is an extensive, documented
collection of C<TT>++</TT> classes and support tools for use with G<TT>++</TT>.

<LI>

<B>NIH Class Library</B> 3.0

The NIH Class Library (formerly known as "OOPS", Object-Oriented
Program Support) is a portable collection of classes, similar to those
in Smalltalk-80, which has been developed by Keith Gorlen of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), using the C<TT>++</TT> programming
language.

<LI>

<B>BFD</B>

The BFD (Binary File Descriptor) library allows a program which operates
on object files (such as <CODE>ld</CODE> or GDB) to support many different formats in
a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so that only BFD needs
to know the actual details of a particular format.  One consequence of
this design is that all of the programs using BFD will support formats
such as a.out, COFF, ELF, and ROSE.  BFD comes with documentation.

<LI>

<B>GDB</B> 4.7

GDB 4 is no longer considered beta test and replaces GDB 3.5, which was
previously on this tape.  Object files and symbol tables are now read
via the BFD library, which allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs
of multiple object file types such as a.out and COFF.  Other features
include improvements to the command language, remote debugging over
serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints (breakpoints triggered when the
value of an expression changes); when used with GCC version 2,
exception handling, support for SunOS shared libraries, and C<TT>++</TT>
multiple inheritance.

GDB 4 can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB 4 <EM>targets</EM> a
platform means that it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To
say that GDB 4 can <EM>host</EM> a given platform means that it can be
built on it, but cannot necessarily debug native programs.  GDB 4
can:


<UL>

<LI><EM>target</EM> and <EM>host</EM>: Amiga 3000 (Amix), DECstation 3100

&#38; 5000, HP 9000/370 (BSD), IBM RS/6000 (AIX), i386 (BSD, SCO, or Linux),
Motorola Delta 88000 (System V), NCR 3000 (SVR4), SGI Iris (MIPS running
Irix V3 or V4), SONY News (NewsOS 3.x), Sun 3 &#38; SPARC (SunOS 4.1 or
Solaris 2.0), &#38; Ultracomputer (29K running Sym1).

<LI><EM>target</EM>, but not <EM>host</EM>: i960 Nindy, AMD

29000 (COFF or a.out), Fujitsu SPARClite, Hitachi H8/300, m68k,
and m68332.

<LI><EM>host</EM>, but not <EM>target</EM>: Intel 386 (Mach), IBM

RT/PC, HP/Apollo 68k (BSD)

</UL>

In addition, GDB 4 can use the symbol tables emitted by the compilers
supplied by most vendors of MIPS-based machines, including DEC.  (These
symbol tables are in a format which almost nobody else uses.)

<LI>

<B><CODE>ae</CODE></B>

<CODE>ae</CODE> works with GCC to produce more complete profiling
information.

<LI>

<B>binutils</B> 1.9

The binutils include <CODE>ar</CODE>, <CODE>gprof</CODE>, <CODE>ld</CODE>, <CODE>nm</CODE>,
<CODE>ranlib</CODE>, <CODE>size</CODE>, and <CODE>strip</CODE>.  The GNU linker <CODE>ld</CODE>
is fast, and is the only linker which emits source-line numbered error
messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined references.

<LI>

<B>Bison</B> 1.19

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<CODE>yacc</CODE>, with more features.  Source for the <CITE>Bison</CITE> manual is
included.

<LI>

<B>COFF Support</B>

The entire suite of GNU software tools can be run on System V, replacing
COFF entirely.  The GNU tools can operate on BSD object files with a
COFF header the System V kernel will accept.  <CODE>robotussin</CODE> is
supplied for converting standard libraries to this format.  However,
this workaround is becoming obsolete, as BFD is replacing it (see the
entry on "BFD").

<LI>

<B><CODE>dld</CODE></B> 3.2.3

<CODE>dld</CODE> is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your
program with the <CODE>dld</CODE> library allows you to dynamically load
object files into the running binary.

<LI>

<B><CODE>f2c</CODE></B> 3.2.90

<CODE>f2c</CODE> converts Fortran--77 source files into C or C<TT>++</TT>.

<CODE>lex</CODE> does.  Source for the <CITE>Flex</CITE> manual is included.

<LI>

<B>GAS</B> 1.38.1

The GNU assembler (GAS) is a fairly portable, one pass assembler that is
almost twice as fast as Unix <CODE>as</CODE> and works for 32x32, 680x0,
80386, SPARC (Sun-4), and VAXen.

<LI>

<B>GAWK</B> 2.14

GAWK is upwardly compatible with the System V Release 4 version of
<CODE>awk</CODE>.  Source for the <CITE>GAWK</CITE> manual comes with the software.

<LI>

<B><CODE>gdbm</CODE></B> 1.5

The <CODE>gdbm</CODE> library is the GNU replacement for the standard
<CODE>dbm</CODE> and <CODE>ndbm</CODE> libraries.  <CODE>gdbm</CODE> supports both styles
but does not need sparse database formats (unlike its Unix
counterparts).

<LI>

<B><CODE>gmp</CODE></B> 1.2

GNU MP (<CODE>gmp</CODE>) is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic,
operating on signed integers and rational numbers.  It has a rich set of
functions, all with a regular interface.

<LI>

<B><CODE>gperf</CODE></B> 2.1

<CODE>gperf</CODE> is a "perfect" hash-table generation utility.  There are
actually two implementations of <CODE>gperf</CODE>, one written in C and one
in C<TT>++</TT>.  Both will produce hash functions in either C or C<TT>++</TT>.

<LI>

<CODE>indent</CODE> 1.6

<CODE>indent</CODE> is the GNU-modified version of the freely-redistributable
BSD program of the same name.  It formats C source according to GNU
coding standards by default, though the original default and other
formats are available as options.

<LI>

<B><CODE>perl</CODE></B> 4.035

Larry Wall has written a fast interpreter named <CODE>perl</CODE> which
combines the features of <CODE>sed</CODE>, <CODE>awk</CODE>, <CODE>sh</CODE>, and C.  It
has all these programs' capabilities, as well as interfaces to all the
system calls and many C library routines.

<LI>

<B>Smalltalk</B> 1.1.1

GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language
system written in portable C.  Features include an incremental garbage
collector, a binary image save capability, the ability to invoke
user-written C code and pass parameters to it, a GNU Emacs editing mode,
optional byte-code compilation tracing and byte-code execution tracing,
and automatically loaded per-user initialization files.

<LI>

<B>superopt</B> 2.1

Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for
a given function.  You have to tell the superoptimizer which function
and which CPU you want to generate code for, and how many instructions you
can accept.  The GNU superoptimizer and its application in GCC is
described in the <CITE>ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92 proceedings</CITE>.  Superopt
presently supports 7 CPUs: SPARC, m68000, m68020, m88000, IBM RS/6000,
AMD 29000, Intel 80x86, and Pyramid.

<LI>

<B>Autoconf</B> 1.2

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source
code packages.  These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of
Unix-like systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a
configuration script for a package from a template file which lists the
operating system features which the package can use, in the form of
<CODE>m4</CODE> macro calls.  Many GNU programs use Autoconf-generated
configure scripts now.

<LI>

<B>BASH</B> 1.12

The GNU shell, BASH (for Bourne Again SHell), is compatible with the
Unix <CODE>sh</CODE> and offers many extensions found in <CODE>csh</CODE> and
<CODE>ksh</CODE>.  BASH has job control, <CODE>csh</CODE>-style command history, and
command-line editing (with Emacs and <CODE>vi</CODE> modes built-in and the
ability to rebind keys).

<LI>

<B><CODE>bc</CODE></B> 1.02

<CODE>bc</CODE> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision.
GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> was implemented from the POSIX 1003.2 draft standard, but
it has several extensions including multi-character variable names, an
<CODE>else</CODE> statement, and full Boolean expressions.

<LI>

<B><CODE>cpio</CODE></B> 2.2

<CODE>cpio</CODE> is an alternative archive program with all the features of
SVR4 <CODE>cpio</CODE>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1
<CODE>ustar</CODE> standard.

<LI>

<B>CVS</B> 1.3

The Concurrent Version System, CVS, manages software revision and release
control in a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group environment.  It
works best in conjunction with RCS versions 4 and above, but will parse
older RCS formats with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See Berliner,
Brian, "CVS-II: Parallelizing Software Development," <CITE>Proceedings of
the Winter 1990 USENIX Association Conference.</CITE>

<LI>

<B><CODE>diff</CODE></B> 2.0

GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than the traditional Unix versions.
The "diff" distribution contains <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>diff3</CODE>, <CODE>sdiff</CODE>,
and <CODE>cmp</CODE>.

<LI>

<B><CODE>elvis</CODE></B> 1.6

<CODE>elvis</CODE> is a clone of the <CODE>vi</CODE>/<CODE>ex</CODE> Unix editor.  It
supports nearly all of the <CODE>vi</CODE>/<CODE>ex</CODE> commands in both visual
and line mode.  <CODE>elvis</CODE> runs under BSD, System V, Xenix, Minix,
MS-DOS, and Atari TOS, and it should be easy to port to many other
systems.

<LI>

<B>Fax</B> 3.2.1

The GNU Project is distributing the freely-available MIT AI Lab fax
spooling system, which provides Group 3 fax transmission and reception
services for a networked Unix system.  It requires a faxmodem which
conforms to the new EIA-592 Asynchronous Facsimile DCE Control Standard,
Service Class 2.

<LI>

<B><CODE>find</CODE></B> 3.7

<CODE>find</CODE> is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts
to find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary
operations on them.  <CODE>xargs</CODE> and <CODE>locate</CODE> are also included.

<LI>

<B><CODE>finger</CODE></B> 1.37

GNU Finger should work on a wide variety of systems.  For more
information, see the "GNU Project Status Report."

<LI>

<B>fontutils</B> 0.6

The "fontutils" can create fonts for use with Ghostscript or TeX,
starting with a scanned type image and converting the bitmaps to

<B>Fun and Games: MandelSpawn</B> 0.06, <B>GNU Chess</B> 4.0.pl58, <B>NetHack</B>
3.0, <B>GnuGo</B> 1.1, and <B><CODE>hello</CODE></B> 1.1

MandelSpawn is a parallel Mandelbrot program for the MIT X Window
System.  GNU Chess has text and X display interfaces (see "Project GNU
Status Report").  NetHack is a display-oriented adventure game similar
to Rogue.  GnuGo plays the game of Go (Wei-Chi); it is not yet very
sophisticated.

The GNU <CODE>hello</CODE> program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the GNU
General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

<LI>

<B>Ghostscript</B> 2.5.2 and <B>Ghostview</B> 1.4.1

Ghostscript is GNU's graphics language which is almost fully compatible
with Postscript (see "Project GNU Status Report").  Ghostview provides
an X11 user interface for the Ghostscript interpreter.  Ghostview and
Ghostscript function as two cooperating programs; Ghostview creates a
viewing window and Ghostscript draws in it.

<LI>

<B><CODE>gnuplot</CODE></B> 3.2

<CODE>gnuplot</CODE> is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
expressions and data.  Curiously, the program was neither written nor
named for the GNU Project; the name is a coincidence.

See the entry on GNU Graphics "Contents of the Experimental Tape" for
information on a related program.

<LI>

<B><CODE>gptx</CODE></B> 0.2

<CODE>gptx</CODE> is the GNU version of <CODE>ptx</CODE>, a permuted index
generator.  Among other things, it produces readable "KWIC" (KeyWords

various features (such as the ability to scroll backwards) which most
pagers lack.

<LI>

<B><CODE>m4</CODE></B> 1.0.3

GNU <CODE>m4</CODE> is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor and is mostly System V Release 4 compatible, although it has
some extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional
parameters to macros).  <CODE>m4</CODE> also has built-in functions for
including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.

<LI>

<B>mtools</B> 2.0.7

Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to allow Unix systems
to read, write, and manipulate files on an MS-DOS file system (typically
a diskette).

<LI>

<B><CODE>patch</CODE></B> 2.0.12g8

<CODE>patch</CODE> is our version of Larry Wall's program to take

generate the modified version.

<LI>

<B>RCS</B> 5.6

The Revision Control System, RCS, is used for version control and
management of software projects.  When used with GNU <CODE>diff</CODE>, RCS
can handle binary files (executables, object files, 8-bit data, etc).

<LI>

<B><CODE>recode</CODE></B> 3.2.4

<CODE>recode</CODE> converts files between character sets and usages.  When
exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of offending
characters or fall back on approximations.  It recognizes or produces
more than a dozen character sets and can convert each character set to
almost any other one.  <CODE>recode</CODE> pays special attention to
superimposition of diacritics, particularly for French.

<LI>

<B><CODE>screen</CODE></B> 3.2b

<CODE>screen</CODE> is a terminal multiplexor which allows you to handle
several independent "screens" (ttys) on a single physical terminal.
Each virtual terminal emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and
ISO 2022 functions.  <CODE>screen</CODE> sessions can be detached and resumed
later on a different terminal.

<LI>

<B><CODE>sed</CODE></B> 1.13

<CODE>sed</CODE> is a stream-oriented version of <CODE>ed</CODE>.  It is used
frequently in shell scripts.

<LI>

<B><CODE>tar</CODE></B> 1.11.1

GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> includes multivolume support, the ability to archive
sparse files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote
archives, and special features to allow <CODE>tar</CODE> to be used for
incremental and full backups.  Unfortunately GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> implements
an early draft of the POSIX 1003.1 <CODE>ustar</CODE> standard which is
different from the final standard.  Adding support for the new changes
in a backward-compatible fashion is not trivial.

<LI>

<B>Termcap</B> 1.1

The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for <CODE>libtermcap.a</CODE>
on any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of
Termcap entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is
extensive documentation in Texinfo format.

<LI>

<B><CODE>time</CODE></B> 1.4

<CODE>time</CODE> is used to report statistics (usually from a shell) about
the amount of user, system, and real time used by a process.

<LI>

<B><CODE>tput</CODE></B> 1.0

<CODE>tput</CODE> is a portable way to allow shell scripts to use special
terminal capabilities.  GNU <CODE>tput</CODE> uses the Termcap database,

<LI>

<B><CODE>wdiff</CODE></B> 0.4

<CODE>wdiff</CODE> compares two files, finding which words have been deleted
or added to the first in order to obtain the second.  We hope eventually

<B>GCC</B> 2.3.3

Version 2 of GCC is in late beta test, getting close to being reliable.
In addition to the features in version 1, GCC 2 has instruction
scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf function
optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, a certain amount of
common subexpression elimination (CSE) between basic blocks (though not
all of the supported machine descriptions provide for scheduling or
delay slots), and a feature for assigning attributes to instructions.
Function-wide CSE has been written, but needs to be cleaned up before it
can be installed.  Position-independent code is supported on the 88000
and SPARC.

GCC 2 can also open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type
<CODE>long long int</CODE>).  It can generate code for most of the same
machines as version 1, plus the following: AMD 29000, Acorn RISC, DEC
Alpha, Elxsi, HP-PA (700 or 800), IBM RS/6000, IBM RT/PC, Intel 80386,
Intel 960, Motorola 88000, and SPARC (running Solaris 2).  Version 2 can
generate a.out, COFF, ELF and OSF-Rose files when used with a suitable
assembler.  It can produce debugging information in several formats: BSD
stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs symbols, and DWARF.

Not all of the version 1 machine descriptions have been updated yet;
some do not work, and others need work to take full advantage of
instruction scheduling and delay slots.  The old machine descriptions
for the Alliant, Tahoe, and Spur (as well as a new port for the Tron) do
not work, but are still included in the distribution in case someone
wants to work on them.

Using the new configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is
as easy as building a compiler for the same target machine.  Version 2
supports more general calling conventions: it can pass arguments "by
reference" and can preallocate the space for stack arguments.  GCC 2 on
the SPARC uses the standard conventions for structure arguments and
return values.

Version 2 of the compiler supports three languages: C, C<TT>++</TT> and
Objective C; the source file name extension or a compiler option selects
the language.  The front end support for Objective C was donated by
NeXT.  The runtime support needed to run Objective C programs is now
distributed with GCC (this does not include any Objective C classes
aside from <CODE>object</CODE>).

GNU C has been extended to support nested functions, nonlocal gotos, and
taking the address of a label.

Source for the GCC manual, <CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE>, is included
with the compiler.

Since the C compiler has been unbundled in Solaris, this tape
temporarily contains compiled binaries of GCC for Solaris systems in
addition to the sources.  In the future, Solaris binaries will be
available on separate media.

<LI>

<B>binutils</B> 2.0

Version 2.0 of the binutils have been completely rewritten to use the
BFD library (see "Gnu Project Status Report").  This version has been
tested on only a few architectures including the Sun-3 and Sun-4 running
SunOS 4.1, and the Sony News running NewsOS 3.

This version has not been ported to as many machines as the old
binutils.  Some features of the old versions are missing in the new
programs.  We would appreciate patches to make things run on other
machines; especially welcome are fixes for what used to work in the old
versions.

<LI>

<B>GNU C Library</B> 1.05

The library is ANSI C-1989 and POSIX 1003.1-1990 compliant and has most
of the functions specified in POSIX 1003.2 draft 11.2.  It is upward
compatible with the 4.4 BSD C library and includes many System V
functions, plus GNU extensions.

Version 1.05 uses a standard GNU <CODE>configure</CODE> script and runs on
Sun-3 &#38; Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1), HP 9000/300 &#38; Sony NEWS 800 (4.3 BSD), MIPS
DECstation (Ultrix 4.2), and i386/i486 (System V &#38; BSD).
The C library comes with a newly finished manual in source form.

<LI>

<B>libg<TT>++</TT></B> 2.3

This is the GNU C<TT>++</TT> library for GCC version 2 (see "Contents of
Languages Tape" for more info regarding libg<TT>++</TT>).  The latest
version tries to configure itself automatically, thus working out of the
box on many hosts.  Recent changes include portability enhancements,
some use of templates, and converting the iostream classes to use
multiple inheritance.

<LI>

<B>Oleo</B> 1.2.1

Oleo is a spreadsheet program.  It supports X windows and
character-based terminals, and can generate Embedded Postscript
renditions of spreadsheets.  Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs
users and are configurable.  Under X and in Postscript output,
Oleo supports multiple, proportionally spaced fonts.

<LI>

<B>GNU Graphics</B> 0.17

GNU Graphics is a set of programs which produce plots from ASCII or
binary data.  It supports output to Tektronix 4010, Postscript, and the
X Window System or compatible devices.  Improvements in this version
include a revised manual; new features in <CODE>graph</CODE>, <CODE>xplot</CODE> and
<CODE>plot2ps</CODE>; support for output in ln03 and TekniCAD TDA file
formats; a replacement for the <CODE>spline</CODE> program; examples of shell
scripts using <CODE>graph</CODE> and <CODE>plot</CODE>; the addition of a statistics
toolkit; and the use of <CODE>configure</CODE> for installation.

Existing ports need retesting.  Contact Rich Murphey,
<CODE>Rich@rice.edu</CODE>, if you can help test/port it to anything
other than a SPARCstation.

<H3><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="bull14.html#TOC31">Contents of the X11 Tapes</A></H3>

<P>
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 5 of the MIT X Window
System.  The first FSF tape contains all of the core software,
documentation, and some contributed clients.  We call this the
`required' X tape since it is necessary for running X or running GNU
Emacs under X.  The second, `optional,' FSF tape contains contributed
libraries and other toolkits, the Andrew Toolkit, games, and other
programs.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="bull14.html#TOC32">Berkeley Networking 2 Tape</A></H3>

<P>
The Berkeley "Net2" release contains the second 4.3 BSD distribution
and is newer than both 4.3BSD-Tahoe and 4.3BSD-Reno.  It includes most
of the BSD software system except for a few utilities, some parts of the
kernel, and some library routines which your own C library is likely to
provide (we have replacements on other tapes for many of the missing
programs).  This release also contains third party software including
Kerberos and some GNU software.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="bull14.html#TOC33">VMS Emacs and Compiler Tapes</A></H3>

<P>
We offer two VMS tapes.  One has just the GNU Emacs editor.  The second
contains the GNU C compiler, Bison (needed to compile GCC), <CODE>gas</CODE>
(needed to assemble GCC's output), and some library and include files.
We are not aware of a GDB port for VMS.  Both VMS tapes have executables
from which you can bootstrap, since the DEC VMS C compiler cannot
compile GCC.  Please do not ask us to devote effort to VMS support,
because it is peripheral to the GNU Project.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="bull14.html#TOC34">GNU Source Code CD-ROM</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation has produced its first CD-ROM.  This CD
contains sources to the distribution of the GNU Project including:
Emacs, GCC, G<TT>++</TT>, GDB, Bison, GAS, Make, GAWK, Texinfo, the GNU
Utilities, RCS and CVS, <CODE>f2c</CODE>, <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>, Ghostscript,
<CODE>tar</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, and BASH, as well as the MIT X Window System,
and MIT Scheme.  This CD included everything on our Emacs, Languages
(except T), Utilities, Experimental, X11 Required and X11 Optional tapes
as of October 1992.  Note that the BSD-Net2 tape contents are not on
this CD.  Some of the versions are earlier then listed in "GNU Software
Available Now".  These programs are not on this CD: PCL, CLISP,
Autoconf, Fax, <CODE>wdiff</CODE>, <CODE>screen</CODE>, Termcap, and Oleo.

</P>

<P>
The CD-ROM also contains some packages ported to Intel 80386 and
80486-based machines running MS-DOS: Demacs, DJGPP, and MIT Scheme 7.2.
In addition, it contains Mtools, which is a public domain collection of
programs to allow Unix systems to read, write, and manipulate files on
an MS-DOS file system (typically a diskette).

</P>

<P>
The CD is in ISO 9660 format and can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most operating systems.  You can build most of this software
without needing to copy the sources off the CD.  It requires only enough free
disk space for the object files and the intermediate build targets.
Except for several of the MS-DOS packages, there are no precompiled
programs on this CD.  You will need a C compiler (programs which need
some other interpreter or compiler normally provide the C source for a
bootstrapping program).

</P>
<P>
The CD costs $400 if you are buying it for a business or other
organization, or $100 if you are buying it for yourself.

</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>What do the individual and company prices mean?</B>

The software on our disk is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can
run it.  What we charge for is the physical disk.

We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a
company or other organization buys the disk, we charge $400.  When an
individual buys the same disk, we charge just $100.

You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you
are buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then
the disk is really for the company, so please pay the company price
and get reimbursed for the company price.  We won't try to check up on
you--we use the honor system--so please cooperate.

Buying CDs at the company price is especially helpful for the GNU
project; just 80 CDs at the company price will support an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

<LI><B>Why is there an individual price?</B>

In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by
companies.  The CD at the price of $400 provides them with all of our
software for a much lower price than they would previously have paid
for six different tapes.  To lower the price further would cut into
the FSF's funds very badly.

However, for individuals, $400 is too high a price; hardly anyone
could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals
at the lower price of $100, but not do the same for companies.

<P>
The FSF is now distributing some of the GNU software that has been
ported to MS-DOS on 3.5 inch, 1.44MB diskettes.  The disks contain
both source and executables.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="bull14.html#TOC36">Contents of the Demacs diskettes</A></H3>

<P>
Demacs is a version of Emacs 18.55 ported to MS-DOS, with some changes
from Emacs 18.57.  Two versions are actually included--one which
handles 8-bit character sets, and one, based on Nemacs, which handles
16-bit character sets, including Kanji.  We distribute it on five
3.5 inch diskettes, containing both source and executables.

</P>
<P>
Demacs runs on Intel 80386 and 80486--based machines running MS-DOS.
It is compatible with XMS memory managers and VCPI, but not with
Microsoft Windows extended mode or other DPMI managers.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="bull14.html#TOC37">Contents of the DJGPP diskettes</A></H3>

<P>
DJGPP is a complete port of GCC, libraries, development utilities, and

MS-DOS.  We distribute it on four 3.5 inch diskettes, containing both
source and executables.

</P>
<P>
DJGPP requires at least 5MB of hard disk space to install, and 512K
of RAM to use.  It is compatible with XMS memory managers and VCPI, but
not with Microsoft Windows extended mode or other DPMI managers.  It
cannot emulate multitasking (e.g. <CODE>fork(2)</CODE>) or signals.

<P>
The Free Software Foundation has been repeatedly asked to create a
package that provides executables for all of our software.  Usually we
offer only sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source
code, the Deluxe Distribution includes copies of all our printed
manuals.

</P>
<P>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to
hundreds of different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler,
the GNU Debugger, the complete MIT X Window System, and the GNU
utilities.

</P>
<P>
You may choose one of the following machines and operating systems: HP

<B>GNU Software not on Apple computers</B>

In lawsuits, Apple claims the power to stop people from writing any
program that has a user interface that works even vaguely like the
Macintosh's.  If Apple triumphs in the courts, it will create for itself
a new power over the public that will enable it to put an end to free
software.  So long as Apple is committed to establishing this kind of
monopoly, we will not provide any support or software for Apple
machines.

<B>Linux: a free Unix system for 386 machines</B>

Linux (named after its author, Linus Torvalds) is a free Unix clone
which implements a subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  Linux
has been written from scratch and does not contain any proprietary code
in the kernel.  Many of the utilities and libraries are GNU software.
Linux runs only on 386/486 AT-bus (and some EISA-bus) machines.  Porting
to non-Intel architectures is hard since the kernel makes extensive use
of 386 memory management and task primitives.  Linux is freely
distributable and available via anonymous FTP:
<CODE>tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux</CODE> (USA),
<CODE>nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux</CODE> (Europe).  See newsgroup
<CODE>comp.os.linux</CODE> for Linux discussions.  Ask

<B>Demacs, GNU Emacs for MS-DOS</B>

Manabu Higashida and Hirano Satoshi have released Demacs, a GNU Emacs
port for 386/486 MS-DOS.  Version 1.2.0 is the first post-beta release.
Demacs provides several DOS-specific features: support for binary or
text file translation, "8bit clean" display mode, 80x86 software
interrupt calls via a <CODE>int86</CODE> Lisp function, machine-specific
features such as function key support, file name completion with drive
name, child processes (<CODE>suspend-emacs</CODE> and <CODE>call-process</CODE>).
Dired mode works without <TT>`ls.exe'</TT>.  Anonymous FTP it from:
