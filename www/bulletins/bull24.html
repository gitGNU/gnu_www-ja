<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="bull24.html#TOC5">What Is the FSF?</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced "guh-noo") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</P>
<P>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have three specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and
distribute it to your friends and co-workers; second, the freedom to change
a program as you wish, by having full access to source code; third, the
freedom to distribute a modified version and thus help build the community.
Free software means you can study the source and learn how such programs
are written; it means you can port it or improve it, and then share your
work with others.

</P>
<P>
If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a distribution fee or you
may give it away, so long as you include the source code and the <I>GNU
General Public License</I>; see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</A>, for details.

</P>
<P>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</P>
<P>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</P>
<P>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President; <BR>
Gerald J. Sussman
and Geoffrey Knauth, Directors.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="bull24.html#TOC6">What Is Copyleft?</A></H1>

<P>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.
But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <EM>all</EM> users.  To prevent this,
<EM>copyleft</EM> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</P>
<P>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <EM>GNU General Public License</EM> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <EM>GNU Library General
Public License</EM> (LGPL), applies to a few (but not most) GNU libraries.
This license permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables
under certain conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU
source code distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available
upon request.

</P>

<P>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each
license.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="bull24.html#TOC7">What Is Linux?</A></H1>

<P>
Linux (named after its main author, Linus Torvalds) is a GPL'ed kernel that
implements POSIX.1 functionality with SysV &#38; BSD extensions.
GNU/Linux systems are now available for Alpha &#38;
386/486/Pentium/Pentium Pro
An m68k port is in
testing (it runs on high end Amiga &#38; Atari computers).
MIPS, PowerPC &#38; Sparc ports are being worked on.

<H1><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="bull24.html#TOC8">What Is a GNU/Linux System?</A></H1>

<P>
by Richard M. Stallman

</P>
<P>
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every
day, without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the
version of GNU which is widely used today is more often known as
"Linux", and many users are not aware of the extent of its
connection with the GNU Project.

</P>
<P>
There really is a Linux; it is a kernel, and these people are using
it.  But you can't use a kernel by itself; a kernel is useful only as
part of a whole system.  The system in which Linux is typically used
is a modified variant of the GNU system--in other words, a Linux-based
GNU system.

</P>
<P>
Many users are not fully aware of the distinction between the kernel,
which is Linux, and the whole system, which they also call "Linux".
The ambiguous use of the name doesn't promote understanding.

</P>
<P>
Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel.  But since they
have generally heard the whole system called "Linux" as well, they
often envisage a history which fits that name.  For example, many
believe that once Linus Torvalds finished writing the kernel, his
friends looked around for other free software, and for no particular
reason most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was
already available.

</P>
<P>
What they found was no accident--it was the GNU system.  The
available free software added up to a complete system because the GNU
Project had been working since 1984 to make one.  The GNU Project set
forth the goal of developing a free Unix-like system, called GNU.  By
the time Linux was written, the system was almost finished.

</P>
<P>
Most free software projects have the goal of developing a particular
program for a particular job.  For example, Linus Torvalds set out to
write a Unix-like kernel (Linux); Donald Knuth set out to write a text
formatter (TeX); Bob Scheifler set out to develop a window system (X
Windows).  It's natural to measure the contribution of this kind of
project by specific programs that came from the project.

</P>
<P>
If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way,
what would we conclude?  One CD-ROM vendor found that in their "Linux
distribution", GNU software was the largest single contingent, around
28% of the total source code, and this included some of the essential
major components without which there could be no system.  Linux itself
was about 3%.  So if you were going to pick a name for the system
based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate
single choice would be "GNU".

</P>
<P>
But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question.
The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific
software packages.  It was not a project to develop a C compiler,
although we did.  It was not a project to develop a text editor,
although we developed one.  The GNU Project's aim was to develop
<EM>a complete free Unix-like system</EM>.

</P>
<P>
Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the
system, and they all deserve credit.  But the reason it is <EM>a
system</EM>---and not just a collection of useful programs--is because the
GNU Project set out to make it one.  We wrote the programs that were
needed to make a <EM>complete</EM> free system.  We wrote essential but
unexciting major components, such as the assembler and linker, because
you can't have a system without them.  A complete system needs more
than just programming tools, so we wrote other components as well,
such as the Bourne Again SHell, the PostScript interpreter
Ghostscript, and the GNU C library,

</P>
<P>
By the early 90s we had put together the whole system aside from the
kernel (and we were also working on a kernel, the GNU Hurd, which runs
on top of Mach).  Developing this kernel has been a lot harder than we
expected, and we are still working on finishing it.

</P>
<P>
Fortunately, you don't have to wait for it, because Linux is working
now.  When Linus Torvalds wrote Linux, he filled the last major gap.
People could then put Linux together with the GNU system to make a
complete free system: a Linux-based GNU system (or GNU/Linux system,
for short).

</P>
<P>
Putting them together sounds simple, but it was not a trivial job.
The GNU C library (called glibc for short) needed substantial changes.
Integrating a complete system as a distribution that would work "out
of the box" was a big job, too.  It required addressing the issue of
how to install and boot the system--a problem we had not tackled,
because we hadn't yet reached that point.  The people who developed
the various system distributions made a substantial contribution.

</P>
<P>
Aside from GNU, one other project has independently produced a free
Unix-like operating system.  This system is known as BSD, and it was
developed at UC Berkeley.  The BSD developers were inspired by the
example of the GNU Project, and occasionally encouraged by GNU
activists, but their actual work had little overlap with GNU.  BSD
systems today use some GNU software, just as the GNU system and its
variants use some BSD software; but taken as wholes, they are two
different systems which evolved separately.  A free operating system
that exists today is almost certainly either a variant of the GNU
system, or a kind of BSD system.

</P>
<P>
The GNU Project supports GNU/Linux systems as well as <EM>the</EM>
GNU system--even with funds.  We funded the rewriting of the
Linux-related extensions to the GNU C library, so that now they are
well integrated, and the newest GNU/Linux systems use the current
library release with no changes.  We also funded an early stage of the
development of Debian GNU/Linux.

</P>
<P>
We use Linux-based GNU systems today for most of our work, and we hope you
use them too.  But please don't confuse the public by using the name
"Linux" ambiguously.  Linux is the kernel, one of the essential major
components of the system.  The system as a whole is more or less the GNU
system.  Please use the term "Linux-based GNU system" or "GNU/Linux"
when you talk about the system which is a combination of Linux and GNU.

</P>

<P>
 

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="bull24.html#TOC9">What Is the Hurd?</A></H1>

<P>
The Hurd is a collection of server processes that run on top of Mach, a
free message-passing microkernel developed at CMU.  The Hurd and Mach
together form the kernel of the GNU/Hurd operating system.  The GNU C Library
implements the Unix "system call" interface by sending messages to
Hurd servers as appropriate.
<P>
The Hurd allows users to create and share useful projects without
knowing much about the internal workings of the system--projects that might
never have been attempted without freely available source, a well-designed
interface, and a multiple server design.  The Hurd is thus like other
expandable GNU software, e.g. Emacs and GUILE.

</P>

<P>
Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform
exists.

</P>
<P>
We have made several test releases of the Hurd.
<P>
We need help with significant Hurd-related projects.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should send mail
to <CODE>gnu@gnu.org</CODE>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C
Library to new systems is another way to help.
<P>
You can obtain
test releases of
the Hurd
from a GNU FTP host (see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC37">How to Get GNU Software</A>)
along with complete binaries for an i386 GNU/Hurd system.  We will not be
distributing these on CD-ROM until they are more stable.

<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="bull24.html#TOC11">Free Software Redistributors Donate</A></H1>

<P>
The FSF receives many donations generated by the redistribution of software
or the sale of paper publications.  For the users' sake, it is best when
redistributors and publishers who donate to the FSF make clear and precise
statements of the amount of donation on their packaging and book covers.

</P>
<P>
For example, <B>IKARIOS</B> of France donates 5 FF from sale of each
LINDIS, SuSE, or Red Hat CD set.  Their packaging specifies "5 FF to the
Free Software Foundation for the GNU Project".  And <B>Kyoto</B>
<B>Micro</B> <B>Computer</B> of Japan regularly donates 10% of its
GNU-related revenues.
<P>
<B>Red</B> <B>Hat</B> <B>Software</B>
donates $1.00 for every copy of the Power Tools CD set.
<P>
The <B>Sun</B> <B>Users'</B> <B>Group</B> -- <B>Deutschland</B> is
exceptionally clear: their CD says, "Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the
FSF."  
We thank all of these free software redistributors for contributing to the GNU Project in a clear way.
<P>
By arrangement with author Arnold Robbins, <B>Specialized</B>
<B>Systems</B> <B>Consultants</B> donates 3% of revenues from
<CITE>Effective AWK Programming</CITE> and the associated <CITE>AWK Reference
Card</CITE>.  Many authors of articles in SSC's <CITE>Linux Journal</CITE> designate
us to receive their fees.

</P>
<P>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Distribution of free software or its
documentation offers an opportunity to raise funds for such development in
an ethical way.  The redistributors and authors listed above make use of the
opportunity, but many others let it go to waste.
<P>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</P>
<P>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</P>
<P>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated,"
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</P>
<P>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler or to Mach contribute more; major new features and programs
contribute the most.

</P>
<P>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software or its documentation
for a fee, we can assure a steady flow of resources for making more free
software.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="bull24.html#TOC12">Help from Free Software Companies</A></H1>

<P>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partly on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

<H1><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="bull24.html#TOC14">GNU/Linux Helps Bring Titanic To Life</A></H1>

<P>
In an article originally published in Linux Journal (issue 46),
Daryll Strauss, a software engineer at Digital Domain, describes the 
use of GNU/Linux in generating visual effects for the film Titanic.

</P>
<P>
Using 200 DEC Alpha-based systems running the Red Hat 4.1 distribution of
GNU/Linux, after upgrading the kernel to support the PC164 mainboard,
Digital Domain found a performance increase of three to four over SGI
systems. The combination of the GNU/Linux OS and Alpha CPUs also delivered
the most cost-effective solution to time and processing demands.

</P>
<P>
Daryll Strauss writes that feature film and television visual effects
development has provided a high performance, cost-sensitive, proving
ground for GNU/Linux.  He concludes that the low entry cost, versatility
and interoperability of GNU/Linux is sufficiently attractive to warrant
more extensive investigation, experimentation, and deployment.

<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="bull24.html#TOC15">GNU in Space</A></H1>

<P>
The European Space Agency says the Free Software Foundation's
GNU C Compiler is essential to the on-board microprocessors it uses
in space.  

</P>
<P>
ESA computer procurement depends on the availability of appropriate tools
to satisfy the specific needs of spacecraft software.  The use of GCC (the
GNU C Compiler) and GNAT (the GNU New York University Ada Translator) is
being promoted by ESA as a way of obtaining low-cost compilation systems,
especially for the MIL-STD-1750 and SPARC V7 architectures.

</P>
<P>
GCC and GNAT, an Ada-95 front-end for GCC, have a number of advantages
that matter to the ESA:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

they are both free software;
<LI>

they have a large and active user community, which compensates
for the lack of conventional support and maintenance;
<LI>

errors are widely reported and fixes or work-around
solutions are published by the same users;
<LI>

they require a minimum of computer resources (RAM memory, hard
disk space)
<LI>

their quality (e.g., the quality of their front-ends) and the
quality of the generated code (size and performance) is good,
and compares well with proprietary compilers.
</UL>

<P>
The ESA found these GNU programs so useful that they gave a contract to
Chris Nettleton Software, a free software company in Farnborough, UK
<TT>`http://www.ccfn.demon.co.uk'</TT>, to make modifications on GCC and GNU
Ada.  Nettleton developed GCC-1750 for the MIL-STD-1750 computer used in
spacecraft.  The compilation systems will be accompanied by a set of
high-level tools and libraries to facilitate the development of software
applications for space.

Project have moved to the domain <CODE>gnu.org</CODE>.  Our Email address is now
<CODE>gnu@gnu.org</CODE>, and our web server is now <TT>`http://www.gnu.org'</TT>.

Unfortunately, we are no longer able to offer guest accounts.

<LI><B>New Book/CD of GNU Software for Microsoft Systems</B>

At long last, we are publishing the book/CD combination, <CITE>GNU Software for
MS-DOS and MS-Windows</CITE>.  The CD-ROM contains both source code and runnable
binaries; the book explains how to install the software, and briefly
describes what the various packages are useful for.
<P>
The book also explains why, to be truly free, you must move away from
proprietary operating systems from Microsoft or elsewhere, and use a free
operating system such as GNU/Linux.

<LI><B>X11 Runs on the Hurd</B>

The X Window System, specifically Xfree86, has been ported to the GNU Hurd.
See <CODE>ftp://ftp.nop.or.jp/pub/gnu-0.2/XFree86/3.3.2/</CODE>, in particular
the files <TT>`X332-Hurd.tar.gz'</TT> and <TT>`3.3.2-hurd.*.gz'</TT>.

<LI><B>New Schedule for GNU CD-ROMs</B>

We plan to update GNU CD-ROMs more
frequently--quarterly, instead of once or twice per year.  Subscribers to
the Source Code CD-ROM series will probably receive their next CD-ROM
before the next bulletin.  The GNU Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM will be
updated when new systems or more current program versions are available.
Check our web site for the latest CD-ROM release information.

<LI><B>New Source Code CD!</B>   (see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC34">March 1998 Source Code CD-ROMs</A>)

We are currently releasing the March 1998 (Edition 11) Source Code CD-ROMs.
Once again, it is a two disk set.  These CD-ROMs contain important bug
fixes and improvements for many packages, and some new packages.
On the CD-ROMs are full distributions of X11R6.3, Emacs,
GCC, and current versions of all other GNU Software.
See section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC22">GNU Software</A>, for more about these packages.

<LI><B>New/Updated Manuals since Last Bulletin</B>   (see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC36">GNU Documentation</A>)

Since the last bulletin, we have published updated editions
of two of our manuals

<CITE>GAWK: The GNU Awk User's Guide</CITE>, revised for <CODE>gawk</CODE> version
3.0.3;

<CITE>Texinfo: The GNU Documentation Format</CITE>, for Texinfo version
3.11. 

<LI><B>Display Ghostscript Funded</B>

A year ago, the Free Software Foundation and Net Community called for
donations to fund completion of Display Ghostscript--that is, the
extension of Ghostscript to support the Display Postscript features.  We
have now raised the full amount.

Work has already started on Display Ghostscript and much progress has been  
made.  Ghostscript has been extended to accept input from a client socket and  
draw into a client specified window.  The DPS client library has been  
combined with Ghostscript to form a single source code package.  Currently  
specific DPS operators and some extensions are being implemented; such as  
multiple execution contexts, view clipping, alpha channel, compositing, and  
type 2 images.

<LI><B>GTK</B>

GTK is the GNU GUI toolkit, which serves as the basis for the GIMP and
GNOME.  It can be used from C and other compiled programming languages, and
also from GUILE.  A convenient C<TT>++</TT> interface to GTK, called GTK<TT>++</TT>,
is being developed.

<LI><B>The GIMP</B>   <EM>Also see</EM> <TT>`http://www.gimp.org/'</TT>

The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program--a replacement for Adobe
Photoshop.  Although its developers still considered it to be in the
testing stage, many users already regard it as superior to the original.

<LI><B>Netscape Browser May Become Free--Or May Not</B>

In January, Netscape announced plans to release source code for its
browser--and perhaps to make it free software.  This could be a great day
for the free software movement, or a great disappointment, depending on the
distribution terms that Netscape uses.

Just recently Netscape released a first draft of proposed distribution
terms, which are on the border of being free software, but have serious
problems.  For example, you are not allowed to make a change unless you
publish it.  Also, linking Netscape code together with code covered by the
GNU GPL is impossible; any way of doing this would violate one license or
the other.

The final decision is supposed to be made by the end of March.  For the latest
news, see URL <TT>`http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape.html'</TT>.

<LI><B>A New FSF T-shirt!</B>   (Also see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC38">FSF T-shirt</A>)

<P>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC22">GNU Software</A>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>GNU Privacy Guard</B>

The GNU Privacy Guard is a free program for private communication using
public key encryption.  It will be released under the GNU GPL, and will
be patent-free all around the world.  Most of the code is written, but
we can't predict yet when the release will be.

After the GNU Private Guard is released, we hope to follow it with a
free replacement for SSH, and then, if possible, free software for
secure financial transations on the World Wide Web.

<LI><B>E-scape</B>

E-scape is a graphical web browser currently in development.
We plan to support CSS1, PNG, tables, and frames.
XML support and client-side scripting will likely be added eventually.

E-scape is on hold right now.  We don't know whether a free GNU web browser
is still needed because we don't know whether the Netscape browser will be
released on suitable terms.  By April we will have
cancelled E-scape, or resumed work at full speed.

<LI><B>GNOME</B>

GNOME is the GNU GUI desktop project, started by Miguel de Icaza in
August 1997.  It is based on the GTK GUI toolkit, and uses GUILE for
extensibility.  GNOME replaces the Teak project, which had been placed
on hold while Jim Blandy finished the development of GUILE.

GNOME provides a set of application framework libraries to facilitate
making all applications consistent and hiding all of the configuration,
session management, help and common user interface details from the
programmer.  We are using MICO, a GPL/LGPL implementation of CORBA, to
export the functionality of our bigger applications as servers: editing
interface, text editing, image editing, file management, document display,
dictionary, calendar/tasks/rolodex.

GNOME development is being carried out by numerous volunteers together with
several programmers funded by Red Hat Software.

<LI><CODE>gnusql</CODE>

<CODE>gnusql</CODE> (formerly <CODE>gss</CODE>) is the GNU SQL Server, a multiuser
relational DBMS.  An alpha release is currently available.  For info on
updates, paths, and most recent releases as well as links to related
documentation, software, and mailing lists, see
<TT>`http://www.ispras.ru/~gsql'</TT>.

<LI><B>GNU Emacs</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC24">GNU and Recommended Software Now Available</A>)

The next Emacs release, 20.3, will once again count buffer
positions and string indices in characters, not bytes,
even when you use multibyte characters.

Future versions of Emacs will have support for variable-width fonts
(already written) and inclusion of graphics in a document.  Also, perhaps,
the ability to save the undo history in a file (which allows you to undo
older changes in the history).  Our long term plan is to move it in the
direction of a WYSIWYG word processor and make it easier for beginners to
use.

<LI><B>GNUstep</B>   (Also see "Objective-C Library" in section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC22">GNU Software</A>.)

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement,
there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, named GNUstep.  Work has begun on GNUstep, starting with a
library written in Objective-C.  Much remains to be done to bring this
library close to the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should contact
<CODE>gnustep-maintainer@gnu.org</CODE>.
Also see <TT>`http://www.gnustep.org/'</TT>.

<LI><B>C Interpreter</B>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
task is partly finished.  GCC generates byte code for all supported
languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
finish this work has begun.  To make this work usable, we need to enhance
GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We would also like support for
compiling just a few selected functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<CODE>gnu@gnu.org</CODE>.

<LI><B>Fortran</B>   (For info on <CODE>f2c</CODE> &#38; GCC, see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC24">GNU and Recommended Software Now Available</A>)

The GNU Fortran (<CODE>g77</CODE>) front end is stable, but more work is needed
to bring its overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the
levels the Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: improving
documentation and diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially for
large, densely initialized data tables; completing existing support for
<CODE>INTEGER*2</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER*8</CODE>, and similar features; allowing
intrinsics in <CODE>PARAMETER</CODE> statements; and providing debug information
on <CODE>COMMON</CODE> and <CODE>EQUIVALENCE</CODE> variables.  We don't know when
these things will be done, but hope some will be finished in the coming
months.  You can speed progress by working on them or by offering funding.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <CODE>g77</CODE>.  To subscribe,
ask <CODE>info-gnu-fortran-request@gnu.org</CODE>.  To contact the
developer of <CODE>g77</CODE> or get current status, write or finger
<CODE>fortran@gnu.org</CODE>.

<LI><B>Oleo</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC24">GNU and Recommended Software Now Available</A>)

Oleo is the spreadsheet program for the GNU project.  We've brushed
the dust off, and are working on giving Oleo a facelift.  In Oleo's
next release, it will support GTK<TT>++</TT>, as well as link in with Plotutils
for graph creation. We are also "internationalizing" Oleo using GNU
Gettext, to handle messages in languages other than English.  Macros
in Oleo will be handled in Guile to allow for the most flexible
language possible.  Many reported bugs from the last release (Oleo 1.6)
have been fixed as well.  Lastly, Oleo now has a complete set of
documentation included in the package in Texinfo format.

<LI><B>The Dictionary Project</B>

The FSF has a copy of the unabridged <CITE>Century Dictionary</CITE>, now in the
public domain, and we want to put it online.  We tried OCR, but it wasn't
reliable enough.  It looks like the only way to do this is to have people
type it in.  The job will need many volunteers; that means it first needs a
manager with a can-do attitude and substantial time.  If you want to
volunteer to be the manager, please write to <CODE>gnu@gnu.org</CODE>.
<P>
This project provides a way for people without programming skills or money
to contribute to the GNU Project.

<H1><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="bull24.html#TOC20">GNU Software in the Year 2000</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide warranties for its software.
We can't afford to.  So we can't promise that GNU software has no Year 2000
bugs, any more than we could promise you the same thing about another sort
of bug.  But we can tell you some reasons why such bugs are probably very
few.

</P>
<P>
The main reason is theoretical.  GNU systems, and Unix-like systems
generally, represent date and time as a 32-bit integer, counting seconds
from the beginning of 1970.  This 32-bit count will overflow in 2038; but
there will be no problem in that year, because by then all systems will
have redefined <CODE>time_t</CODE> to be a 64-bit integer.

</P>
<P>
We also have some practical evidence that there are few problems.  Some
users running a Linux-based GNU system, specifically Debian GNU/Linux (see
<TT>`http://www.debian.org'</TT>), used their machines for a while with the
clocks set forward to the year 2000.  They reported no special problems.
Of course, that is not an exhaustive test, but it suggests that there are
not enough Year 2000 bugs in GNU software to cause major or lasting
difficulties.

</P>
<P>
If you would like to help us eliminate any Year 2000 bugs, we suggest that
for a few days you set the clock on one of your machines ahead a few years.
You could also set it to Dec 31, 1999, and see if anything unusual happens
as the clock advances to the next century while you are working.
<P>
If you do find a problem, please send a bug report about it--then the bug
will most likely get fixed in a new release, well before the year 2000
rolls around.
<P>
Whether you encounter a problem or not, we would appreciate hearing which
programs you tested in this way, and for how long a period of actual
working time.  Please inform <CODE>gnu@gnu.org</CODE> of the results you get.

</P>
<P>
You can check that you are using the latest release of any particular GNU
program by comparing version numbers with one of our FTP mirrors
(see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC37">How to Get GNU Software</A>).

The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our

to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers do now; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

<P>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part
of preparing a new improved version that helps all users.
We may send you a patch for a bug so
that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug
report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from
another user on our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the
Service Directory.

</P>
<P>
Please do not ask us to help you install software or learn how to use
it--but do tell us how an installation script fails or where
documentation is unclear.

</P>
<P>
When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development or by writing free software
improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

<LI><CODE>abuse</CODE>     (SrcCD)

The recently-freed program <CODE>abuse</CODE>
is a dark, side-scrolling game
with Robotron-esque controls:
you control your movement with the keyboard
and fire &#38; aim with the mouse.
You can get more info at <TT>`http://crack.com/games/abuse'</TT>.

<LI><CODE>acct</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>acct</CODE> is a system accounting package.
It includes the programs
<CODE>ac</CODE> (summarize login accounting),
<CODE>accton</CODE> (turn process accounting on or off),
<CODE>last</CODE> (show who has logged in recently),
<CODE>lastcomm</CODE> (show which commands have been used recently),
<CODE>sa</CODE> (summarize process accounting),
<CODE>dump-utmp</CODE> (print a <CODE>utmp</CODE> file in human-readable format),
&#38;
<CODE>dump-acct</CODE> (print an <CODE>acct</CODE> or <CODE>pacct</CODE> file in human-readable format).

<LI><CODE>acm</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>acm</CODE> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

<LI><B>aegis</B>   (SrcCD)

Aegis is a transaction-based
software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on
many changes to a program concurrently,
and Aegis coordinates integrating these changes
back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

<LI><B>Apache</B>   <EM>Also see</EM> <TT>`http://www.apache.org/'</TT>   (SrcCD)

Apache is an HTTP server used on almost 50% of the Web sites on the
Internet.  It has an extensive API for modular enhancements, many 
features, and a large family of add-ons; it is highly flexible, runs on many
popular operating systems, and has an active development group and user
community.

<LI><B>Autoconf</B>   (SrcCD)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <CODE>m4</CODE> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <CODE>m4</CODE> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

<LI><B>Automake</B>   (SrcCD)

Automake is a tool for generating <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> files
for use with Autoconf.
The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile standards.

<LI><B>BASH</B>   (SrcCD)

GNU's shell, BASH (<B>B</B>ourne <B>A</B>gain <B>SH</B>ell), is compatible with the
Unix <CODE>sh</CODE> and offers many extensions found in <CODE>csh</CODE> and
<CODE>ksh</CODE>.  BASH has job control, <CODE>csh</CODE>-style command history,
command-line editing (with Emacs and <CODE>vi</CODE> modes built-in), and the
ability to rebind keys via the <CODE>readline</CODE> library.  BASH conforms to the
POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

<LI><B>bc</B>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>bc</CODE> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992
standard with several extensions, including multi-character variable names,
an <CODE>else</CODE> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <CODE>dc</CODE> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> is not implemented as a <CODE>dc</CODE> preprocessor.

<LI><B>BFD</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

The <B>B</B>inary <B>F</B>ile <B>D</B>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <CODE>ld</CODE> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet
published on paper).
<P>
At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.

<LI><B>Binutils</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

Binutils includes these programs:
<CODE>addr2line</CODE>,
<CODE>ar</CODE>,
<CODE>c<TT>++</TT>filt</CODE>,
<CODE>gas</CODE>,
<CODE>gprof</CODE>,
<CODE>ld</CODE>,
<CODE>nm</CODE>,
<CODE>objcopy</CODE>,
<CODE>objdump</CODE>,
<CODE>ranlib</CODE>,
<CODE>size</CODE>,
<CODE>strings</CODE>,
&#38;
<CODE>strip</CODE>.

Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, <CODE>gas</CODE>,
supports the a29k, Alpha, ARM, D10V, H8/300, H8/500,
HP-PA, i386, i960, M32R, m68k, m88k, MIPS, Matsushita 10200 and 10300,
NS32K, PowerPC, RS/6000, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and
attempts to be compatible
with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It can produce
mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility similar to
that in some other assemblers.
GNU's linker, <CODE>ld</CODE>, supports shared libraries on many systems,
emits source-line
numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined
references, and interprets a superset of AT&#38;T's Linker Command Language,
which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
<CODE>objdump</CODE> can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and
can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format
read by BFD.

<LI><B>Bison</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<CODE>yacc</CODE>.  Texinfo source for the <CITE>Bison Manual</CITE>
and reference card are included.

<LI><B>C Library</B> (<CODE>glibc</CODE>)   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman]</B>

The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the underlying
system permits), &#38; most of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.
It is nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2 specification which
guarantees upward compatibility with 4.4BSD &#38; many System V functions.

When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <CODE>malloc</CODE>
which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.

GNU <CODE>stdio</CODE> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help
writing internationalized programs &#38; the user can adopt the
environment the program runs in to conform with local
conventions.  Extended <CODE>getopt</CODE> functions are already used to
parse options, including long options, in many GNU utilities.  The
name lookup functions now are modularized which makes it easier to
select the service which is needed for the specific database &#38; the
document interface makes it easy to add new services.  Texinfo source
for the <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> is included
(see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC36">GNU Documentation</A>).

Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of
systems.  The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not been
updated since development on version 2.0 started, so today it
runs out of the box only on GNU/Hurd (all platforms GNU/Hurd
also runs on) &#38; GNU/Linux (ix86, Alpha, m68k, MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC;
work is in progress for ARM).
Other architectures will become available again
as soon as somebody does the port.

<LI><B>Calc</B>   (SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator &#38; mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
can use Calc as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many
more features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
logarithmic, trigonometric, &#38; financial functions; arbitrary precision;
complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
algebraic simplification; &#38; differentiation &#38; integration.
It outputs to <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>, &#38;
comes with source for a manual &#38; reference card
(see section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC36">GNU Documentation</A>).

<LI><CODE>cfengine</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>cfengine</CODE> is used to maintain site-wide configuration of a
heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
appearance is similar to <CODE>rdist</CODE>, but allows many more operations
to be performed automatically.
See Mark Burgess, "A Site Configuration Engine", <CITE>Computing
Systems</CITE>, Vol. 8, No. 3 (ask <CODE>office@usenix.org</CODE> how to
get a copy).

<LI><B>Chess</B>   (SrcCD)

GNU Chess enables you to play a game of chess with a computer instead
of a person.
It is useful to practice with when there are significant
spare cpu cycles and a real person is unavailable.
<P>
The program offers a plain terminal interface, one using curses,
and a reasonable X Windows interface <CODE>xboard</CODE>.  Best results
are obtained by compiling with GCC.
<P>
Improvements this past year are in the Windows-compatible version,
mostly bugfixes.

<LI><B>CLISP</B>   (SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible &#38; Michael Stoll.  It
mostly supports the Lisp described by <CITE>Common LISP: The Language (2nd
edition)</CITE> &#38; the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an interpreter,
a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS &#38; a foreign language interface.
The user interface language (English, German, French, Spanish) can be
chosen at run time.  An X11 API is available through CLX &#38; Garnet.  CLISP
needs only 2 MB of memory &#38; runs on all kinds of systems (Unix, MS-DOS,
OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga 500--4000, Acorn RISC PC).  See also
item "Common Lisp", which describes GCL, a complete Common Lisp
implementation with compiler.

<LI><B>CLX</B>   (SrcCD)

CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.
This is separate from the built-in TK interface.

<LI><B>Common Lisp</B> (<CODE>gcl</CODE>)   (SrcCD)

GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
&#38; interpreter for Common Lisp.
GCL is very portable &#38; extremely
efficient on a wide class of applications, &#38; compares favorably in
performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover &#38;
symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.
<P>
GCL compiles to C &#38; then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args &#38; one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in
registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted
code &#38; displays source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler
(based on the C profiling tools) counts function calls &#38; the time spent in
each function.
<P>
There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs
in a separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp
computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
interface.
<P>
There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
does PCL (see
"PCL" later in this article).
<P>
GCL version 2.2.2 is released under the GNU Library General Public
License.

<LI><B>cook</B>   (SrcCD)

Cook is a tool for constructing files,
and maintaining referential integrity between files.
It is given a set of files to create,
and recipes of how to create and maintain them.
In any non-trivial program there will be prerequisites
to performing the actions necessary to creating any file,
such as include files.
The <CODE>cook</CODE> program provides a mechanism to define these.

Some features which distinguish Cook include
a strong procedural description language,
and fingerprints to supplement file modification time stamps.
There is also a <CODE>make2cook</CODE> utility included to ease transition.

<LI><CODE>cpio</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>cpio</CODE> is an archive program with all the features of SVR4
<CODE>cpio</CODE>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <CITE>ustar</CITE>
standard.  <CODE>mt</CODE>, a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
<CODE>cpio</CODE>.

<LI><B>CVS</B>   (SrcCD)

CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows you to
keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who,
when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles multiple developers,
multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations,
and can work over a wide area network.  It does not handle build
management or bug-tracking; these are handled by <CODE>make</CODE> and GNATS,
respectively.

<LI><CODE>cxref</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>cxref</CODE> is a program that will
produce documentation (in LaTeX or HTML)
including cross-references
from C program source code.
It has been designed to work with ANSI C, incorporating K&#38;R,
and most popular GNU extensions.
The documentation for the subject program
is produced from comments in the code
that are appropriately formatted.
The cross referencing comes from the code itself
and requires no extra work.

<LI><B>DDD</B>   (SrcCD)

The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user interface
to GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular Unix debuggers.
DDD provides a <I>graphical data display</I>
where complex data structures
can be explored incrementally and interactively.
DDD has been designed to compete with
well-known commercial debuggers;
as of release 2.1.1, DDD also compiles and runs with
LessTif, a free Motif clone,
without loss of functionality.
For more details, see the DDD Web page at
<TT>`http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/'</TT>.

<LI><B>DejaGnu</B>   (SrcCD)

DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all
tests.  DejaGnu's flexibility &#38; consistency makes it easy to write
tests.
DejaGnu will also work with remote hosts and embedded systems.

with programs.

<LI><B>Diffutils</B>   (SrcCD)

GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
Diffutils package has <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>diff3</CODE>, <CODE>sdiff</CODE>, &#38;
<CODE>cmp</CODE>.
Future plans include support
for internationalization (e.g., error messages in Chinese) &#38; some
non-Unix PC environments, &#38; a library interface that can be used by
other free software.

<LI><B>DJGPP</B>   <EM>Also see "GCC" below</EM>   (BinCD)

DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G<TT>++</TT> to i386s running DOS.  DJGPP has a 32-bit

<LI><B>Emacs</B>     <B>[FSFman(s), FSFrc]</B>

In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
customizable real-time display editor &#38; computing environment.  GNU Emacs
is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated
into the editor--for writing extensions &#38; provides an interface to the
X Window System.  It runs on Unix, MS-DOS, &#38; Windows NT or 95.  In addition to
its powerful native command set, Emacs can emulate the
editors vi &#38; EDT (DEC's VMS editor).  Emacs has many other features which
make it a full computing support environment.  Source for
the <CITE>GNU Emacs Manual</CITE>
&#38;
a reference card
comes with the software.
Sources for the <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE>
and
<CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>
are distributed in separate packages.  See section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC36">GNU Documentation</A>.

<LI><B>Emacs 20</B>   (SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman(s), FSFrc]</B>

The new features in Emacs 20 include support for many languages and many
character codes (the MULE facility) and a new convenient customization
feature.  The text-filling commands handle indented and bulleted paragraphs
conveniently; there are new help facilities for looking up documentation
about functions and symbols in various languages.  A new method of
file-locking works even when using NFS.  Some dired commands have been made
more systematic.

We believe Emacs 20 operates on the same systems as Emacs 19,
but we do not have confirmation for all of them.

<LI><B>Emacs 19</B>   (SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman(s), FSFrc]</B>

Emacs 19 works with character-only terminals &#38; with the X Window System

<LI><CODE>enscript</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>enscript</CODE> is an upwardly-compatible replacement for the Adobe
<CODE>enscript</CODE> program.  It formats ASCII files (outputting in Postscript)
and stores generated output to a file or sends it directly to the printer.

<LI><CODE>es</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>es</CODE> is an extensible shell (based on <CODE>rc</CODE>) with first-class
functions, lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e.,
functions can return values other than just numbers).  <CODE>es</CODE>'s
extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the shell's
built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.  Like <CODE>rc</CODE>,
it is great for both interactive use and scripting, particularly since
its quoting rules are much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

<LI><B>Exim</B>   (SrcCD)

Exim is an Internet mail transfer agent, similar in style to Smail 3.
It can handle relatively high volume mail systems, header rewriting,
control over which hosts/nets may use it as a relay, blocking of
unwanted mail from specified hosts/nets/senders, and multiple local
domains on one mail host ("virtual domains") with several options for
the way these are handled.

<LI><B>Finger</B>   (SrcCD)

GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger <EM>server</EM>
host and other hosts at that site configured as finger <EM>clients</EM>.  The
server host collects information about who is logged in on the clients.  To
finger a user at a GNU Finger site, a query to any of its client hosts gets
useful information.  GNU Finger supports many customization features,
including user output filters and site-programmable output for special
target names.

<LI><B>GCC</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman]</B>

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C<TT>++</TT>, and
Objective-C; the source
file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.
(Also see "GNAT" later in this article for Ada language supports.)
Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC.
(This does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <CODE>object</CODE>, but see "GNUstep" in
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC19">Forthcoming GNUs</A>.)
G<TT>++</TT> seeks to be compliant with the ANSI C++ language standard.
<P>
GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs many
optimizations.
They include:
automatic register
allocation, common sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain
amount of CSE between basic blocks -- though not all the supported machine
descriptions provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion
from loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
elimination, integration of inline functions &#38; frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf function
optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, the ability to assign
attributes to instructions, &#38; many local optimizations automatically deduced
from the machine description.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <CODE>long long
int</CODE>).  It supports extended floating point (type <CODE>long double</CODE>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional
C, &#38; GNU C extensions (including: nested functions support, nonlocal gotos,
&#38; taking the address of a label).
<P>
GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, &#38; DWARF.

<LI><B>GDB</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

GDB, the <B>G</B>NU <B>D</B>e<B>B</B>ugger, is a source-level debugger for C,
C<TT>++</TT>, &#38; Fortran.  It provides partial support for Modula-2 &#38; Chill.
<P>
GDB can debug both C &#38; C<TT>++</TT>, &#38; will work with executables
made by many different compilers; but, C<TT>++</TT> debugging will have
some limitations if you do not use GCC.

GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
interface.  An X interface for GDB, called DDD, is described above.

Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
(breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which
includes simulators for the
ARM,
Hitachi H8/300,
Hitachi SH,
&#38;
PowerPC.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <EM>targets</EM> a platform
means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB can
<EM>host</EM> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
necessarily debug native programs.

<LI><CODE>gpc</CODE>     (SrcCD)

The GNU Pascal Compiler (GPC) is part of
the GNU compiler family, GNU CC or GCC.
It combines a Pascal front end
with the proven GNU compiler backend
for code generation and optimization.
Unlike utilities such as p2c,
this is a true compiler, not just a converter.

Version 2.0 of GPC corresponds to GCC version 2.7.2.1.

The purpose of the GNU Pascal project is
to produce a compiler which:

<UL>

<LI>

combines the clarity of Pascal with powerful tools suitable for
real-life programming,

<LI>

supports both the Pascal standard and the Extended Pascal standard
as defined by ISO, ANSI and IEEE.  (ISO 7185:1990, ISO/IEC
10206:1991, ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989)

<LI>

supports other Pascal standards (UCSD Pascal, Borland Pascal,
Pascal-SC) in so far as this serves the goal of clarity and
usability,

<LI>

can generate code for and run on any computer for which the GNU C
Compiler can generate code and run on.
</UL>

The current release (2.0) implements Standard Pascal (ISO 7185, level 0)
and a large subset of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) and Borland Pascal.  The
upcoming release 2.1 features better conformance to the various Pascal
standards, and of course bug fixes.

GNU Pascal sources are on <TT>`ftp://kampi.hut.fi/jtv/gnu-pascal/'</TT>

is almost compatible with the DWB <CODE>mm</CODE> macros with several extensions.
Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley <CODE>me</CODE> macros and an
enhanced version of the X11 <CODE>xditview</CODE> previewer.  Written in C<TT>++</TT>,
these programs can be compiled with GNU C<TT>++</TT> Version 2.7.2 or later.

Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed
are complete Texinfo documentation, a <CODE>grap</CODE> emulation (a <CODE>pic</CODE>
preprocessor for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar
to <CODE>pm</CODE> (see <CITE>Computing Systems</CITE>, Vol. 2, No. 2; ask
<CODE>office@usenix.org</CODE> how to get a copy), and an ASCII

You will need it if you want to make printed manuals.
See <TT>`http://www.tug.org/web2c/'</TT>.

The Source Code CD-ROM contains a minimal TeX collection,
sufficient to process Texinfo files.  We hope to provide
a full TeX distribution in the future.

<LI><CODE>units</CODE>

GNU `units' converts between different units of measurement,
such as miles/gallon to km/liter.
(It can only handle multiplicative scale changes,
so it cannot convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
though it could convert temperature differences between those temperatures scales.)

<LI><B>UUCP</B>   (SrcCD)

World Wide Web browser that runs as part of Emacs.
It includes support for  frames, tables, stylesheets, and much more.
See <TT>`http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'</TT>.

<LI><CODE>wdiff</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>wdiff</CODE> is a front-end to GNU <CODE>diff</CODE>.  It compares two files,
finding the words deleted or added to the first to make the second.  It has
many output formats and works well with terminals and pagers.  <CODE>wdiff</CODE>
is very useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs
have been refilled.
Plans are to merge this package into <CODE>diffutils</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>Wget</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>Wget</CODE> non-interactively retrieves files from the Web using HTTP
&#38; FTP.  It is suitable for use in shell scripts.

<LI><CODE>windows32api</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>windows32</CODE> is a set of header files &#38; import libraries that
can be used by GNU tools for compiling &#38; linking programs to be run
on Windows NT/95.

<LI><B>WN</B>   (SrcCD)

offers many different capabilities in pre-parsing files before passing
them to the client, and has a very different design from Apache and the
NCSA server.

<LI><B>X11</B>   (SrcCD)

We distribute Version 11, Release 6.3 of the X Window System with the latest
patches &#38; bug fixes.  X11 includes all of the core software, documentation,
contributed clients, libraries, &#38; toolkits,
games, etc.
<P>
While supplies last, we will distribute X11R5 on the November 1993 and
earlier Source Code CD-ROMs.

<LI><CODE>xboard</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>xboard</CODE> is a graphical chessboard for X Windows.  It
can serve as a user interface to the Crafty or GNU chess
programs, the Internet Chess Servers, Email correspondence
chess, or games saved in Portable Game Notation.

<LI><CODE>xgrabsc</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>xgrabsc</CODE> is a screen capture program similar to <CODE>xwd</CODE> but
with a graphical user interface, more ways of selecting the
part of the screen to capture, &#38; different types of output: Postscript,
color Postscript, xwd, bitmap, pixmap, &#38; puzzle.

<LI><CODE>xinfo</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>xinfo</CODE> is an X-windows program for reading Info files.  It uses

<LI><CODE>xmcd</CODE>   <EM>Also see</EM> <TT>`http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/'</TT>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>xmcd</CODE> is an X11-based CD player utility and
<CODE>cda</CODE> is a command-line driven, non-graphical CD audio player.
<CODE>xmcd</CODE> is developed to use the
OSF/Motif API (version 1.1 and later)
and can also be used with LessTif, the free Motif clone.

In its evolution over the past few years,
<CODE>xmcd</CODE> has established itself as
the premier CD player application for the X window system
with an attractive, easy-to-use user interface.
It is feature-rich and runs on virtually
all of the popular Unix and OpenVMS platforms.
It also supports the widest array of CD-ROM and CD-R devices,
including some older SCSI-1 drives
that do not work with other CD player applications.
The remote CD database query feature fully utilizes the Internet
and taps on a vast repository of
CD artists/titles, track titles and other information.
Multi-disc changers are also supported.

Like many other CD player applications,
<CODE>xmcd</CODE> supports a CD database
of disc and track titles and other information.
A distinguishing feature of <CODE>xmcd</CODE> is
the ability to connect to a remote CD database server
to query this information.
Many public Internet CD database servers
have been established around the world for this purpose,
and <CODE>xmcd</CODE> also allows the user to
submit new CD entries to the master database.

<LI><CODE>xshogi</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>xshogi</CODE> is a graphical Shogi (Japanese Chess) board for the X
Window System.  It can serve as a user interface to GNU Shogi, as a

Shogi Server.

<LI><CODE>Ygl</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>Ygl</CODE> emulates a subset of SGI's GL (Graphics Language) library under
X11 on most platforms with an ANSI C compiler (including GCC).  It has most
two-dimensional graphics routines, the queue device &#38; query routines,
double buffering, RGB mode with dithering, Fortran bindings, etc.

<LI><B>zlibc</B>   (SrcCD)

Zlibc is an uncompressing C library for GNU/Linux, Solaris,  SunOS systems.
It is a preloadable shared object that allows executables to
uncompress the datafiles that they need on the fly.
No kernel patch, no recompilation of these executables and
no recompilation of the libraries is needed;
the package overrides the <CODE>open</CODE> function
(and other system call functions) in the shared library.

<H1><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="bull24.html#TOC26">The Deluxe Distribution</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code
and includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, &#38; reference
cards.

</P>
<P>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C<TT>++</TT> Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</P>
<P>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine here.  However, we
can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system--porting is a separate matter.  (To commission a port,
see the GNU Service Directory; details in section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC21">Free Software Support</A>.)
Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an
unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for a common machine.
Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

</P>
<P>
We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with
"Rock Ridge" extensions),
or on one of these tapes in Unix <CODE>tar</CODE> format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -- QIC24,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in c.t. -- QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm c.t., or
DAT 4mm c.t.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</P>
<P>
The printed documentation includes one each of <CITE>Bison</CITE>, <CITE>Calc</CITE>,
<CITE>Gawk</CITE>, <CITE>GCC</CITE>, <CITE>GNU C Library</CITE>, <CITE>GDB</CITE>,
<CITE>Flex</CITE>, <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</CITE>, <CITE>Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>, <CITE>Make</CITE>, <CITE>Texinfo</CITE>, &#38; <CITE>Termcap</CITE>
manuals, six copies of the <CITE>GNU Emacs</CITE> manual, and ten reference cards
for each of Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB.
<P>
Every Deluxe Distribution also includes the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs (immediately below),
which are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</P>
<P>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"
section on
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC44">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>,
and send it to:

<H1><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="bull24.html#TOC27">CD-ROMs</A></H1>

<P>
We offer the section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</A> and
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC32">March 1998 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A>.  
Older versions of each are available at a reduced price (while supplies last).

</P>
<P>
Our CDs are in ISO 9660 format &#38; can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each
CD with "Rock Ridge" extensions
&#38; it will look like a regular Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated &#38; otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</P>
<P>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</P>

<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="bull24.html#TOC28">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</A></H3>

<P>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the March 1998 Source
CD set costs $240; but if you, an individual, are paying out
of your own pocket, the price is $60.  The March 1998 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization; $55 for an individual.  The
MS-DOS/Windows book and CD-ROM costs $140 for a business or organization;
$35 for an individual.

</P>

<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="bull24.html#TOC29">What Do the Different Prices Mean?</A></H4>

<P>
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</P>
<P>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the March 1998 Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.

</P>
<P>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</P>
<P>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
150 Source CDs at that price support an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="bull24.html#TOC30">Why Is There an Individual Price?</A></H4>

<P>
In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

</P>
<P>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</P>
<P>
 

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="bull24.html#TOC31">Is There a Maximum Price?</A></H4>

<P>
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will
accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a
tax-exempt public charity.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="bull24.html#TOC32">March 1998 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A></H3>

<P>
We are releasing the fifth edition of our "Binaries" CD-ROM, which
includes GNU compiler tools that run on several systems that are often
distributed without a C compiler.  (The source code is also included, of
course.)  Thus people who use those systems can compile GNU and other free
software without buying a proprietary compiler.  You can also use these GNU
tools to compile your own programs written in C/C<TT>++</TT>/Objective-C (or
Fortran).  Older editions are available at a discount while supplies last;
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC44">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.
The March 1998, 5th edition includes:

<P>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can help
build binaries for new systems (especially those distributed without a C
compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us.

</P>

<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="bull24.html#TOC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</A></H3>

<P>
GNU Source CD-ROMs include <B>no precompiled programs</B>, so you will need a
C compiler (programs that need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC32">March 1998 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A>.

</P>
<P>
Most editions of our GNU Source Code CD-ROMs are available, including:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC34">March 1998 Source Code CD-ROMs</A>.  The current 11th edition has bug fixes, improvements, and new releases included in no older edition.

<LI>November 1993 Source CD-ROM.  The 3d edition is the last with X11R5.

</UL>

<P>
Editions 1--10 are available at a discount while supplies last.  Each includes contemporary versions of GNU software, X Windows, and Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC36">GNU Documentation</A>.  For some details see
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC44">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

<H1><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="bull24.html#TOC35">CD-ROM Subscription Service</A></H1>

<P>
Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three editions, we will
send you four successive editions of either the section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</A>
or section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC32">March 1998 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A>.  Each new edition will be shipped
when available; our target is four Source editions per year and two Binaries (see
"New Schedule" in section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC16">GNUs Flashes</A>).

</P>
<P>
(Subscribers outside contiguous USA and Canada must pay shipping cost for four editions.  For details, see 
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC44">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.)

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="bull24.html#TOC36">GNU Documentation</A></H1>

<P>
GNU is dedicated to providing quality, easy-to-use online &#38; printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how to
use all the features of each program, &#38; give examples of command use.  GNU
manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both typeset
hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online hypertext
display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for each manual comes
with the software; here are those that we publish as <B>printed books</B>.
See section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC44">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>,
to order them.

</P>
<P>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <EM>lay-flat</EM>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.
Manuals currently in lay-flat binding are:
<CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE>,
<CITE>GDB</CITE>,
<CITE>Emacs</CITE>,
<CITE>Emacs Lisp Reference</CITE>,
<CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>,
<CITE>GAWK: The GNU Awk User's Guide</CITE>,
<CITE>Make</CITE>,
and
<CITE>Bison</CITE>.
Our other manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC (comb) binding.
Our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in by
11in <CITE>Calc</CITE> manual.

</P>
<P>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</P>

<P>
<CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE> (for Version 4.16) tells how to run
your program under GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a
program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>GNU Emacs Manual</CITE> (13th Edition for Version 20)
describes editing with GNU Emacs.
It explains advanced features, including
international character sets;
outline mode and regular expression search;
how to use special programming modes to write
languages like C<TT>++</TT> and TeX;
how to use the <CODE>tags</CODE> utility;
how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and
other elementary customizations.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE> (October 1995 Edition
1.04) is for people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but
who do want to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you
read it in Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE> (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
and <CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition</CITE> (Japanese Draft
Revision 1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
cover this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>GNU Software for MS-DOS and MS-Windows</CITE> is a book and CD combination
containing both source code and runnable executables for MS-DOS, MS-Windows
and MS-Windows 9X.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>GAWK: The GNU Awk User's Guide</CITE> (Edition 2 for Version 3.0.3) tells how
to use <CODE>gawk</CODE>.  It is written for those who have never used <CODE>awk</CODE> and
describes features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.
It clearly delineates those features which are part of POSIX
<CODE>awk</CODE> from <CODE>gawk</CODE> extensions, providing a comprehensive guide
to <CODE>awk</CODE> program portability.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>GNU Make</CITE> (Edition 0.50 for Version 3.75 Beta) describes GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <EM>makefiles</EM>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Flex</CITE> manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <CODE>flex</CODE> program to create a
C<TT>++</TT> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</P>

<P>
<CITE>The Bison Manual</CITE> (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE> (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<TT>++</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Texinfo</CITE> manual (for Version 3.11 of Texinfo) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation &#38; typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
accented &#38; special characters,
indexes, cross references, &#38; how to catch mistakes.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The Termcap Manual</CITE> (3rd Edition for Version 1.3), often
described as "twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap,"
details the format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal
capabilities, and the process of interrogating a terminal description.
This manual is primarily for programmers.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>C Library Reference Manual</CITE> (Edition 0.07 for Version 1.09 Beta)
describes the library's facilities, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" &#38; "system calls."  We are doing small copier runs
of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to
<CODE>bug-glibc-manual@gnu.org</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Emacs Calc Manual</CITE> (for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

</P>

<H1><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="bull24.html#TOC37">How to Get GNU Software</A></H1>

<P>
All the software &#38; publications from the FSF are
distributed with permission to modify, copy, and redistribute.
One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can also get GNU software directly from the FSF by ordering
CD-ROMs and books.  Such orders provide most of the
funds for the FSF staff to develop more free software, so please support
our work by ordering from the FSF if you can.
See section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC44">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software.
Some are listed in section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC11">Free Software Redistributors Donate</A>.  Also see
section <A HREF="bull24.html#SEC39">Free Software for Non-Unix-Like Systems</A>.
Please note that the Free Software
Foundation is <EM>not</EM> affiliated with them in any way and is <EM>not</EM>
responsible for either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of
their responses.

</P>
<P>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partly on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</P>
<P>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of logins.  Please use
one of these other sites that also provide GNU software via FTP (program:
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, user: <CODE>anonymous</CODE>, password: <VAR>your Email
address</VAR>, mode: <CODE>binary</CODE>).  If you
can't reach one of them, get the software from GNU's main FTP host,
<CODE>ftp.gnu.org</CODE>.  More
hosts &#38; details are in <TT>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</TT> &#38;
<TT>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'</TT> on any host.

</P>
<P>
Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE> to
reduce FTP traffic.  Refer to <TT>`/pub/gnu/README-about-.gz-files'</TT>
on any FTP site for instructions on uncompressing them.
(<CODE>uncompress</CODE> and <CODE>unpack</CODE> <EM>do not work</EM>!)

<H1><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="bull24.html#TOC39">Free Software for Non-Unix-Like Systems</A></H1>

<P>
We do not support GNU software on most non-Unix-like systems because that
is peripheral to our goal: making the free operating system GNU as good as
possible.  Volunteers have ported many GNU programs to MS-DOS and
MS-Windows, and because these systems are so popular, we have decided to
publish a book and CD-ROM containing those ports--but even these systems
are a side issue.  We do not want to get involved with supporting GNU
software on non-Unix-like systems, not even Microsoft systems.

</P>
<P>
However, we are willing to publish information about groups who do support
and maintain such ports.  If you are aware of any such efforts, please send
the details, including postal addresses, archive sites, and mailing lists,
to either address on
the top menu.

</P>
<P>
Please do not ask us for more information about the projects listed below,
or any other software for these operating systems, or other non-Unix-like
systems.  We do <EM>not</EM> maintain any of it and have <EM>no</EM> additional
information.

<LI><B>Boston Computer Society</B>

The BCS had numerous free microcomputer programs, including some GNU
programs.
The BCS is now dissolved
(see <TT>`http://www.bcs.org/'</TT> for details),
but many of the smaller groups operating under it
(see <TT>`http://bcs1.ziplink.net/groups/'</TT> for a list)
are continuing.

<LI><B>GNU Software on the Amiga</B>

A large number of GNU programs have been ported to the Amiga and to BeOS
as part of the Geek Gadgets project.  The Geek Gadgets project is headed by Fred Fish (<CODE>fnf@ninemoons.com</CODE>)
and actively supported by
a dedicated group of Amiga and BeOS enthusiasts.
There is a mailing list (<CODE>gg@ninemoons.com</CODE>)
for general discussion about Geek Gadgets,
and several program specific mailing lists.
Send email to <CODE>majordomo@ninemoons.com</CODE>
with the body of the message containing the single word "help",
for more information about what lists are available and how to subscribe.
The Geek Gadgets project also has a web page at
<TT>`http://www.ninemoons.com/GG/'</TT> and an anonymous CVS server with
global read access (see web page for more info).
<P>
For info on the GNU Emacs port,

ask them to approve the FSF as a recipient and to match your donation.
Consult your personnel department.

<H1><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="bull24.html#TOC43">Give to GNU the United Way</A></H1>

<P>
If you participate in a United Way campaign, please consider designating
the Free Software Foundation as the recipient of your donation.

</P>
<P>
Just how do to this depends on where you live, because the United Way is
not a single nationwide corporation, but rather a loose alliance of
separate local organizations with distinct bylaws and methods.  Some United
Way chapters list the FSF as an affiliated charitable organization, which is a
pre-approved recipient of donations.  Some will approve any 501(c)3
association, such as the FSF; some have a narrow explicit focus yet will "respond
to our donors concern about a specific agency to which they are
committed".  Some chapters use a form that prompts for an unlisted
"other" recipient; others require more initiative from you.
