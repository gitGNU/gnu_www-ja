<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="bull22.html#TOC5">What Is the FSF?</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced "guh-noo") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</P>
<P>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have three specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and
distribute it to your friends and co-workers; second, the freedom to change
a program as you wish, by having full access to source code; third, the
freedom to distribute a modified version and thus help build the community.
Free software means you can study the source and learn how such programs
are written; it means you can port it or improve it, and then share your
work with others.

</P>
<P>
If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a distribution fee or you
may give it away, so long as you include the source code and the <I>GNU
General Public License</I>; see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</A>, for details.

</P>
<P>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</P>
<P>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</P>
<P>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President; <BR>
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="bull22.html#TOC6">What Is Copyleft?</A></H1>

<P>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.
But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <EM>all</EM> users.  To prevent this,
<EM>copyleft</EM> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</P>
<P>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <EM>GNU General Public License</EM> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <EM>GNU Library General
Public License</EM> (LGPL), applies to a few (but not most) GNU libraries.
This license permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables
under certain conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU
source code distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available
upon request.

</P>

<P>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each
license.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="bull22.html#TOC7">What Is a GNU/Linux system?</A></H1>

<P>
by Richard M. Stallman

</P>
<P>
A GNU/Linux system is a system which is a combination of Linux and
GNU.

</P>

<P>
Linux is a kernel, compatible with the Unix kernel, written by Linus
Torvalds.
There are several different distributions available via FTP and CD-ROM.
None are distributed by the FSF at this time.

</P>
<P>
GNU is a Unix-like operating system.  We started the GNU Project in 1984
with the aim of bringing such a system into existence.  A Unix-like
operating system consists of many components; we had to obtain each of the
important components somehow.  The job was so large that many of the people
who sympathized with the goal were discouraged from attempting it, but we
decided we would reach the goal no matter how long it took.

</P>
<P>
We found some components already available as free software--for
example, the X Window System &#38; TeX.  Naturally we decided to use
them, since the job was big enough even with short cuts.  We got
other components by helping to convince their developers to free
them--for example, the Berkeley network utilities.
<P>
The rest of components, we had to write.  These include Emacs, the
GNU C &#38; C<TT>++</TT> compilers &#38; libraries, Bash, Ghostscript, Groff, &#38;
many others.

</P>
<P>
All of these various components--those we wrote, those we helped make
free, and those we found already available--together make up the GNU
system.

</P>
<P>
Until recently, users couldn't run <EM>the</EM> GNU system, because one part
(the kernel; see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC15">What Is the Hurd?</A>) was not yet ready.  (We made
the first test release a half year ago.)  However, for a couple of years
now, it has been possible to put together the Linux kernel and the
almost-complete GNU system, resulting in a complete Unix-like free
operating system suitable for actual use.

</P>
<P>
While commonly referred to as "Linux systems", we prefer the term
"Linux-based GNU systems," or "GNU/Linux systems" for short, since
these systems are mostly the same as <EM>the</EM> GNU system.
This gives Linus credit for the kernel that he
wrote, while still indicating that these systems <EM>as a whole</EM> are
essentially variants of the GNU system.

</P>
<P>
We also occasionally use the term "GNU/Hurd system" to emphasize that
we mean a version of the GNU system which uses the Hurd rather than
Linux.

</P>
<P>
We think it is proper to give the GNU Project credit for making the free
Unix-like system that it set out for a decade ago.  But there is a more
important reason for friends of GNU to use names like "Linux-based GNU
system" instead of "Linux system."  This is to help spread the GNU
Project's philosophical idea: that there is ethical importance in
freeing users to share software and cooperate in improving it; that free
software belongs to a community, and people who benefit from the
community should feel a moral obligation to help build the community
when they have a chance.

</P>
<P>
When users install a system which they call "Linux," they can easily miss
ever seeing the GNU idea.  When businesses promote a system and call it
"Linux," they can easily avoid bringing the GNU idea to users' attention.
And if the GNU idea is not widely known, fewer people will write free
software.

</P>
<P>
A conference was recently announced on the topic of developing "Linux
applications"; although the conference is about using the GNU system, the
conference announcement did not mention GNU.

</P>
<P>
The announcement does not even hint that there is any ethical reason to
contribute to free software.  On the contrary, it offers a panel
entitled, "Licenses and licensing--I don't want to give away my
application!!!"  (The three `!' marks appear in the announcement).
Even the title encourages people writing new software (which
could enhance all free operating systems) to make it proprietary
instead, thus contributing nothing to the free software community.

</P>
<P>
It would be harder to express that attitude if everyone knew that the
topic is a variant of the GNU system.  It is up to you and us to make
sure they know.  To do that, we have to inform people using variant
GNU systems that that is what they are doing.

</P>
<P>
So please use "Linux-based GNU system" or "GNU/Linux"
when you talk about a system which is a combination of Linux &#38; GNU.
At first, it may feel strange to go against the flow, but think how much
more "against the flow" it was to start writing a free operating system.
We did it, and you can do it.

</P>

<P>

<P>
In adddition to their conference donation,
<B>Red</B> <B>Hat</B> <B>Software</B>
has agreed to
donate $1.00 to the FSF for every copy of Red Hat Archives sold.
They have also added a GNU logo to the back of that CD with
the words "Supports the Free Software Foundation".
<P>
The <B>SNOW 2.1 CD</B> producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to the
FSF" to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how
much of the price is for the FSF &#38; how much is for the redistributor.
<P>
The <B>Sun Users Group Deutschland</B> has made it even clearer:
their CD says, "Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the FSF."
We thank them for their contribution to our efforts.
<P>
<B>Kyoto</B> <B>Micro</B> <B>Computer</B> of Japan
regularly gives us 10% of their GNU-related sales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hiroshi</B>, <B>Mr. Kojima</B>, and the other authors
of the <CITE>Linux Primer</CITE> in Japan
have donated money from the sales of their book.
<P>
Infomagic has continued to make sizeable donations to the FSF.
<P>
At the request of author Arnold Robbins,
<B>Specialized</B> <B>Systems</B> <B>Consultants,</B> <B>Inc.</B>
continues to donate 3% of their profits from selling
<CITE>Effective AWK Programming</CITE>.
We would also like to acknowledge the many <B>SSC</B> <B>authors</B> who
have donated their royalties and fees to the FSF.

</P>
<P>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.
<P>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</P>
<P>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</P>
<P>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated,"
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</P>
<P>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
&#60;contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler or Mach contribute more; major new features &#38; programs
contribute the most.

</P>
<P>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="bull22.html#TOC10">Help from Free Software Companies</A></H1>

<P>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

</P>

Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) regularly donates a part of its

<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="bull22.html#TOC11">Toyota's Donation</A></H1>

<P>
The VSC Research and Development group of
Toyota Motor Corporation sent us a note
saying that the FSF's "high quality software
makes our work easier, and we value it greatly....
Recently we have received some prizes and monetary awards for our work.
We believe we would not have received these without your software."
They are donating half of the award to the FSF
&#38; hope that publication in the bulletin may encourage further donations
from others.

<H1><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="bull22.html#TOC12">University or Software Company?</A></H1>

<P>
In academe, we like to think that a university has a
mission--advancing and disseminating knowledge.  For today's
university administrators, though, perpetuation of the university has
become an end in itself, never mind how or why.  In their blind
determination to "keep the university afloat," they forget why it
was launched.

</P>
<P>
If you work for a university, or study at one, don't assume it is
immune to this problem.  When you write a program, don't let the
university administration decide whether to share it or not.  Instead,
insist on a detailed written statement saying that you can share your
work with the public, and <EM>don't wait to finish your program before
you get the statement signed</EM>!

</P>
<P>
If you need help, contact the Free Software Foundation; we will be
glad to help you overcome this obstacle to make your software free.
Address the issue early--the sooner you deal with the problem, the
more likely you can solve it.

<H1><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="bull22.html#TOC13">Bad News and Good News about Pine</A></H1>

<P>
Pine is a simple electronic mail reader for beginning users, which we have
included on our Source CDs since 1995.

</P>
<P>
In March of 1996, the Pine developers released a new version with new usage
restrictions.  The new terms do not permit everyone to redistribute, and do
not in general permit distribution of modified versions.  Either restriction
would be enough to prevent Pine from being free software.
This and subsequent versions are off-limits for the free software community.

</P>
<P>
The previous versions of Pine remain free.  However, no substantial
program is bug-free, and every program needs to be maintained.  So
in April 1996, the FSF recruited a team of volunteers
to carry on development of a free mail reader based on the last available
free release of Pine (3.91).  (To avoid trademark issues,
our version will likely be released under a different name.)

</P>
<P>
Forking a program is unfortunate; people should try their best to work
together before giving up and working separately.  So before embarking
on separate development, we tried our best to persuade the old
developers to make their work free software once again.  In the end,
though, they rejected our plea.

</P>
<P>
The good news is that the team of volunteers has done substantial work,
and we hope for a release soon.

<P>
The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) aims to protect the freedom to
write software.  This freedom is threatened by "look-and-feel" interface
copyright lawsuits and by software patents.

</P>
<P>
The League is a grass-roots organization of professors, students, business
people, programmers, users, &#38; even software companies dedicated to
bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League isn't opposed to
the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on individual programs.
The League aims to reverse recent changes made by judges in response to
special interests.

<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="bull22.html#TOC15">What Is the Hurd?</A></H1>

<P>
The Hurd is a collection of server processes that run on top of Mach, a
free message-passing microkernel developed at CMU.  The Hurd and Mach
together form the kernel of the GNU/Hurd operating system.  The GNU C Library
implements the Unix "system call" interface by sending messages to
Hurd servers as appropriate.
<P>
The Hurd allows users to create and share useful projects without
knowing much about the internal workings of the system--projects that might
never have been attempted without freely available source, a well-designed
interface, and a multiple server design.  The Hurd is thus like other
expandable GNU software, e.g. Emacs and GUILE.

</P>

<P>
Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform
exists.  Right now we are using the University of Utah's Mach distribution
(see <TT>`http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/'</TT>)
which we hope will be unified with the distribution produced by the Open
Software Foundation.

</P>
<P>
We have made several test releases of the Hurd.
See section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC16">GNUs Flashes</A>, for recent progress.
<P>
We need help with significant Hurd-related projects.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should send mail
to <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C
Library to new systems is another way to help.
<P>
You can obtain
test releases of
the Hurd
from a GNU FTP host (listed in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC39">How to Get GNU Software</A>)
along with complete binaries for an i386 GNU system.  We will not be
distributing these on CD-ROM until they are more stable.

<LI><B>Hurd Progress</B>   (Also see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC15">What Is the Hurd?</A>)

We have made two test releases of the Hurd, and we will make another
(version 0.2) in this month.  Stability is improving, and we have begun
modifying various user-level utilities to understand new Hurd
filesystem features (fileutils, shellutils, tar, etc.).

One way for people to help out is to compile and run as much
third-party free software as they can; in this way we can find bugs
and deficiencies with some rapidity.  Volunteers with a PC are
therefore eagerly sought to get the new 0.2 release and compile their
favorite Unix programs and games.

<LI><B>GNU System Progress</B>

Version 0.2 of the GNU system will be released in this month, to coincide
with the 0.2 release of the Hurd.  This complete GNU system is
available by FTP.  We are working with Ian Murdock to develop
an excellent package management system for GNU.  This will make
administering and upgrading the system much easier.  Because of
features only the Hurd has, the GNU package management system will be
simpler and more featureful than similar package systems for various
GNU/Linux distributions.

<LI><B>New Source Code CD!</B>   (See section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC35">January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs</A>)

We are releasing the January 1997 (Edition 9) Source Code CD-ROM this month.
Once again, it is a two disk set.
It includes several new programs:
<CODE>gforth</CODE>,
<CODE>gpc</CODE>,
&#60;Meta-HTML&#62;,
<CODE>stow</CODE>,
<CODE>units</CODE>,
VRweb,
<CODE>wget</CODE>,
<CODE>windows32api</CODE>,
and
<CODE>xinfo</CODE>.
On the CD-ROMs are full distributions of X11R6.3, MIT Scheme, Emacs,
GCC, and current versions of all other GNU Software.
See section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>, for more about these packages.

<LI><B>New Compiler Tools CD-ROM</B>  

We are releasing the January 1997 (Edition 4) Compiler Tools
Binaries CD.  Support is included for several new operating
systems, including hppa1.1-hp-hpux10, powerpc-ibm-aix4.2,
sparc-sun-solaris2.4, and sparc-sun-solaris2.5.
These operating systems continue to be on this Cd-ROM:
i386-msdos, hppa1.1-hp-hpux9, sparc-sun-sunos4.1.

The Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM contains ready to run executables of the
GNU compiler tools
for some systems that don't normally come with a compiler.  This allows
users of those systems to compile their own software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.
<P>
We hope to include more systems with each update of this CD-ROM.  If you
can help build binaries for new systems or have one to suggest,
please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

<LI><B>Meta-HTML 5.01 Source Release</B>

Version 5.01 of Universal Access Inc.'s &#60;Meta-HTML&#62; is now available.
<P>
&#60;Meta-HTML&#62; is a programming language specifically designed to work
within the environment of the World Wide Web.  Although it is a genuine
programming language, suitable for large-scale symbolic manipulation,
&#60;Meta-HTML&#62;
also provides the most commonly wanted Web functionality as built-in
primitives, so you don't have to write them.  You can find out more
about the theory of implementation in this white paper
<TT>`http://www.metahtml.com/meta-html/manifesto.html'</TT>.

Web pages are authored using HTML and &#60;Meta-HTML&#62; statements freely
intermixed.  When a page is requested by a browser, the page is passed
through the &#60;Meta-HTML&#62; engine, which
dynamically
processes any
&#60;Meta-HTML&#62; statements to produce a final HTML page which is delivered
to the browser.

The source distribution provides several different interpreter options:
a CGI engine which can be run by any Unix Web server;
a full-featured Web server (mhttpd) with the interpreter built in;
a standalone processor, much like Perl or Tcl; and
an interactive debugger, with a feel similar to GDB (mdb).

There is a user mailing list: <CODE>metahtml-users@metahtml.com</CODE>.
You can subscribe on the Web at <TT>`http://www.metahtml.com/E-Mail/'</TT>,
or by sending mail to <CODE>metahtml-users-request@metahtml.com</CODE>.

Pre-compiled distribution sets for some systems are available via the
&#60;Meta-HTML&#62; Web site at <TT>`http://www.metahtml.com'</TT>.

<LI><B>Generic NQS 3.50.0 released</B>

The new version of Generic NQS brings cluster-wide dynamic scheduling,
SMP support for Digital Unix, prologue/epilogue scripting, support

&#38; many bug fixes.

Generic NQS is firmly established as one of the world's leading
freely-available batch processing systems for Unix-like operating
systems, with over 100 installations world-wide, &#38; over 20 with the
UK HE sector.  Released under version 2 of the GNU General Public
License, Generic NQS supports one of the widest ranges of platforms,

<LI><B>More Support for the Computer as Fax-Machine</B>

Viewfax is designed for rapid interactive viewing of faxes on
your X-Window screen.  If you have a fax modem &#38; use one of the
freely available fax-packages such as HylaFAX or mgetty, viewfax
is ideal for reading received faxes &#38; for previewing outgoing
ones.  It takes less than a second for the page to appear on a
modern workstation.  You can step forwards &#38; backwards through
a sequence of pages &#38; change the magnification by zooming in or
out.
<P>
Viewfax can look at any g3- or g4-coded fax file,
including multipage tiff/f files, so it can be part of a
document archiving system: you could scan b/w documents &#38; store them as
g4-compressed tiff files; then view them later with viewfax.

<LI><B>VRweb Browser</B>

VRweb, a browser for 3D models on the Web written in the Virtual Reality
Modeling Language (VRML), is now available under the GPL.
VRweb works in conjunction with Web browsers on Unix &#38; Windows platforms.

VRweb is a joint project of IICM (home of Hyper-G), NCSA (home of
Mosaic), &#38; the University of Minnesota (home of Gopher).
The software is freely available in binary &#38; source.
VRweb 1.2 for Unix has just been released,
VRweb 1.2 for Windows will follow in due course.
You can download VRweb from

<H1><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="bull22.html#TOC17">Astronomical Analysis Systems Freed</A></H1>

<P>
by Dr. Joseph Harrington, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

</P>
<P>
In the past year, three of the five most popular data reduction
packages in astronomy have changed to free licensing.  This is an exciting
development because it signals a shift in institutional thinking
toward GPL.  These packages typically contain 100 MB--1 GB of code
and documentation.  One is commercial (and remains proprietary) and
the rest were developed as projects of observatory consortia.  Prior
licensing ranged from free-for-non-commercial to painfully negotiated,
individual paper licenses.  The institutions have conquered their
fears and now trust the GPL to protect their interests.

</P>
<P>
The packages involved are:
<P>
<B>AIPS++</B> - (C++ rewrite of Classic AIPS, first to go GPL in 1995)
National Radio Astronomy Observatory &#38; many others,
GPL,
<TT>`http://aips2.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/html/aips++.html'</TT>;
<P>
<B>Classic AIPS</B> - Astronomical Image Processing System,
National Radio Astronomy Observatory,
GPL (new this year),
<TT>`http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/aips-home.html'</TT>;
<P>
<B>IDL</B> - Interactive Data Language,

and
<P>
<B>MIDAS</B> - Munich Image Data Analysis System,
European Southern Observatory,
GPL (new this year),
<TT>`http://www.eso.org/midas-info/midas.html'</TT>.
<P>
A table comparing many (mostly free) environments potentially useful
to data analysis appears at
<TT>`http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/barrett/IDAE/table.1.html'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The owner of the commercial package was at a conference in September
&#38; says he believes strongly in object-only licensing (he gets $1500
per user).  Most people at the conference &#38; in the field at large
strongly dislike the company's attitude &#38; the restrictions placed on
this work, &#38; much of the discussion at a workshop on interactive data
analysis environments centered on how to reproduce the functionality
of this package's excellent routines in a free system.  This will be
Difficult, but the commitment appears to be there.  A number of
efforts have already been started, one of which (numerical Python,
<TT>`http://www.python.org/'</TT>) has the support of a major lab.

</P>

<H1><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="bull22.html#TOC18">Free Music Philosophy</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Music Philosophy (FMP) is an idea that encourages free copying,
distribution, and modification of music.  As with free software, the word
"free" refers to freedom, not price.  The philosophy is that abridging
the freedom of music is destructive to society.  The FMP primarily refers to
noncommercial use; commercial use is addressed elsewhere.

</P>
<P>
Compulsory licenses and tariff-based schemes free musical compositions and
sound recordings (the two forms of copyright in music) to a limited degree
for commercial purposes.  Music is further freed by not abridging any
noncommercial use.  The FMP advocates voluntary freeing of music (primarily
for noncommercial purposes, optionally for commercial purposes), to result
in a society with enhanced freedoms.  The FMP serves as an ethical guide and
counters music industry propaganda.

</P>
<P>
Ram Samudrala has released his first album, <CITE>Twisted Helices' Traversing a
Twisted Path</CITE>, utilizing the FMP.  It has sold 700+ copies in its first
seven months.  There are many bands who have self-released albums, some
on major labels, that have not sold as many copies, or, more importantly,
have not seen revenues from the sale of even a single copy.  While Samudrala
has done aggressive marketing, he attributes a significant part
of his success to the FMP.

</P>
<P>
Other bands have adopted this idea, motivated by ethics and the economic
benefits of the publicity provided by freeing music.  A prime example is the
progressive-metal band Angra, who have sold 80,000+ of their first release.
Due to limited distribution of the official recordings, several bootlegs
have sprung up.  Singer Andre Matos believes that the bootlegs have increased
sales.

</P>
<P>
Thus it can be argued that free music is good marketing.  However, freeing
music must be motivated by ethics.  The economic rationale is justification
against critics who argue that it deprives artists of income.  Supporters of
the FMP are not opposed to musicians making an income from music, but feel
it is unethical to engage in destructive practices to do so.

There is a mailing list in Japan to discuss both hardware &#38; software which
is under the GNU General Public License.  It provides information about
making your own computer system.  The main language of the list is
Japanese.  If you are interested in getting information or having
discussions in English, ask <CODE>mka@apricot.juice.or.jp</CODE> or
<CODE>ishiz@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp</CODE>.

Many groups in Japan now distribute GNU software.  They include JUG, a PC
user group; ASCII, a periodical and book publisher; the Fujitsu FM
Towns users group; and SRA's special GNU users' support group, Wingnut, who
also purchased the first Deluxe Distribution package in Japan
(also see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC10">Help from Free Software Companies</A>).  (Since
then, there have been several other purchases of Deluxe Distribution
packages in Japan.)

<P>
It is easy to place an order directly with the FSF from Japan, thus funding
new software.  To get an FSF Order Form written in Japanese, ask
<CODE>japan-fsf-orders@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.
We encourage you to buy our software CDs:
for example, 150 CD-ROM orders at the
corporate rate allow the FSF to hire a programmer for a year to write more
free software.

The Research Institute for Advanced Information Technology (AITEC)
releases ICOT Free Software (IFS) to the public.  IFS is a software
archive in the field of parallel processing &#38; knowledge processing
developed at ICOT in the Fifth Generation Computer Project &#38; its
follow-on project.  Besides IFS, AITEC has just started releasing many
software programs developed at many groups through its
research funding activities with release conditions similar to those
of IFS.  Through their web page, AITEC releases 20 major IFS programs
&#38; 22 programs developed through AITEC's research funding program.
<P>
As of the end of October 1996, over 4,600 persons have accessed
AITEC's web page, &#38; almost 29,000 IFS files have been transferred
since the first release in 1992.

</P>
<P>
Newly developed software will be released to the public with conditions
similar to those of IFS.

The ImageSearcher is an object-oriented program to search images by
specifying properties of the image itself, without relying on the
name or attributes of the file.  It searches focusing on typical color,
average luminance, nine colors, image extent, center spectra, etc.
It runs on VisualWorks 2.5.1 (Smalltalk).  As a
result of the "eMMa Project" research sponsored by IPA and SRA
(written by Atsushi Aoki), the source code and documentation are
distributed under the GPL as free software, and are
available via FTP from host

<P>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>e-scape

E-scape is being designed as a web browser with graphical capabilities.

<LI><CODE>gss</CODE>

<CODE>gss</CODE> is the GNU SQL Server.  We expect to be making a test release soon.

<LI><B>GNU C Library</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

Version 2.0 of the GNU C library should be released when you read this.
GNU/Hurd
support is now fully functional.  The new GNU C library will also be
the new standard system C library on GNU/Linux, <TT>`libc.so.6'</TT>.  The
GNU C library is now maintained by Ulrich Drepper (who also did the
Linux/i386 port) but it would not be what it is today without the help
of Roland McGrath (former maintainer and main contributor), David
Mosberger-Tang and Richard Henderson (Linux/Alpha and 64-bit ELF
support), Andreas Schwab (Linux/m68k support), and many others.

The goal for the GNU C library is to conform to the POSIX &#38; X/Open
standards; we are very close to that goal.  The main improvements are
new floating-point printing/reading functions that are perfectly accurate
&#38; much faster than the old code (Ulrich); an <TT>`nsswitch.conf'</TT>
mechanism for versatile name database lookup, paving the way for easy
plug-in support of protocols like NIS (Roland &#38; Ulrich); a complete
set of internationalization features including POSIX.2-compatible
<CODE>locale</CODE> &#38; <CODE>localedef</CODE> programs, &#38; catalogs for displaying
program messages in languages other than English (Ulrich again, the
Proceedings to the First Conference on Freely Redistributable
Software contains a paper about this work; to order a copy of the
Proceedings, see the FSF Order Form, in the centerfold).

The most progressive change is probably the complete thread-safeness.
Functions with a non-reentrant interface now have a reentrant
counterpart, others use internal locking.  The whole standard I/O and
<TT>`nsswitch.conf'</TT> mechanism is thread safe.  Together with a
separately available thread library the system now nearly 100%
conforms with the POSIX threads standard.

The library now builds as a shared library for systems that use the ELF
object file format.  Included is the run-time loader (<CODE>ld.so</CODE>) which
sets up the shared libraries when a program runs; it works now with the
Hurd &#38; Linux kernels, and is easy to port to other ELF systems such as SVR4
&#38; Solaris 2.

<LI><B>GNU Emacs</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

Future versions of Emacs will: save the undo history in a file (which allows
you to undo older changes in the history) and also have support for
variable-width fonts, wide character sets, and the world's major languages.
Our long term plan is to move it in the direction of a WYSIWYG word
processor &#38; make it easier for beginners to use.

<LI><B>GNUstep</B>   (Also see "Objective-C Library" in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement over
three years ago, there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, named GNUstep.  Work has begun on GNUstep, starting with a
library written in Objective-C.  Much remains to be done to bring this
library close to the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should contact
<CODE>mccallum@gnu.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.
Also see <TT>`http://www.gnustep.org/'</TT>.

<LI><CODE>recode</CODE>    (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

The next <CODE>recode</CODE> release should give more flexible control over
encodings of charsets, offer MIME conversions, &#38; handle ISO-10646
(Unicode).  It will install a library &#38; support files to help work towards
internationalizing GNU.

<LI><B>Teak</B>

Teak, the GNU desktop interface, is intended to enable users with
minimal computer experience to browse the filesystem, launch programs,
&#38; perform file manipulations. Teak is still in the early
stages of development, but here are some of the features planned for
the first release:
view directories sorted by name, date, size, etc,
or treat the directory as a field of icons to arrange as they
please within the window;
drag-&#38;-drop  --  edit a file by
dragging it into an editor program's window, or print a file by
dropping it on a printer icon; &#38;
for easy access, you can place icons for frequently-used files or
programs directly on the background of your screen.
<P>
For the second release, volunteers have offered to enhance Teak to
browse FTP sites, tar files, etc.

We have designed Teak around GUILE.
which will simplify Teak, keep its
user interface flexible, &#38; allow easy interaction with other GNU
programs.

Teak's developer, Jim Blandy, also works on GUILE.
Jim has put aside Teak to concentrate on GUILE; after
enough progress has been made on GUILE,
he will be resuming his work on Teak.

Why do we call it Teak?
"Because Teak makes a mighty fine desktop."

<LI><CODE>ptx</CODE>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

The next release of <CODE>ptx</CODE> should offer contextualized support for SGML
texts as the first step towards a major overhaul for the package.

<LI><B>C Interpreter</B>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
task is partly finished.  GCC generates byte code for all supported
languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
finish this work has begun.  To make this work usable, we need to enhance
GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We would also like support for
compiling just a few selected functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI><B>Fortran</B>   (For info on <CODE>f2c</CODE> &#38; GCC, see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

The GNU Fortran (<CODE>g77</CODE>) front end is stable, but more work is needed
to bring its overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the
levels the Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: improving
documentation and diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially for
large, densely initialized data tables; completing existing support for
<CODE>INTEGER*2</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER*8</CODE>, and similar features; allowing
intrinsics in <CODE>PARAMETER</CODE> statements; and providing debug information
on <CODE>COMMON</CODE> and <CODE>EQUIVALENCE</CODE> variables.  We don't know when
these things will be done, but hope some will be finished in the coming
months.  You can speed progress by working on them or by offering funding.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <CODE>g77</CODE>.  To subscribe,
ask <CODE>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  To contact the
developer of <CODE>g77</CODE> or get current status, write or finger
<CODE>fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI><B>Smalltalk</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC23">GNU Software</A>)

The next release, version 1.2, is planned to use Autoconf.  It
will have substantial performance improvements &#38; memory requirement
reductions, more control over memory allocation, ability to use the
Smalltalk interpreter as a C callable library, better X Window System
interfaces, ability to represent &#38; manipulate C data structures in
Smalltalk, conditional compilation facilities, large integer support, an
advanced GUI-based class browsing system, better
TCP/IP interfaces, exception support, weak references, &#38; finalization
support.  It will run on Unix, DOS, &#38; Windows NT.

<LI><B>The Dictionary Project</B>

The FSF has a copy of the unabridged <CITE>Century Dictionary</CITE>, now in the
public domain, and we are planning to put it online.  We tried OCR, but it
wasn't reliable enough.
Russell Nelson is coordinating the project.  Volunteers have entered close
to fifty pages so far, but the project needs more help; to volunteer, send
mail to <CODE>dictionary@gnu.ai.mit.edu</CODE> or contact the FSF.

<H1><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="bull22.html#TOC22">Free Software Support</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our
mission is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way
to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers do now; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

</P>
<P>
The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support &#38; other
consulting services.  It is
<TT>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE'</TT> on a GNU FTP host (listed in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC39">How to Get GNU Software</A>),
on the World Wide Web
at URL <TT>`http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/service.html'</TT>,
in the file <TT>`etc/SERVICE'</TT> in the Emacs distribution,

the file <TT>`SERVICE'</TT> in the GCC distribution.
Contact us to get it or to be listed in it.
Service providers who share their income with the FSF are listed in
section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC10">Help from Free Software Companies</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.  We have
many Internet mailing lists for bug reports, announcements, &#38; questions.
They are also gatewayed into USENET news as our <CODE>gnu.*</CODE> newsgroups.
Both are listed in file

or request it from either address on
the top menu.

</P>
<P>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part
of preparing a new improved version that help all users.
We may send you a patch for a bug so
that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug
report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from
another user on our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the
Service Directory.

</P>
<P>
Please do not ask us to help you install software or learn how to use
it--but do tell us how an installation script fails or where
documentation is unclear.

</P>
<P>
When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development or by writing free software
improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC28">CD-ROMs</A>, and printed
section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC38">GNU Documentation</A>,
which includes manuals and reference cards.
In the articles describing the contents of each medium, the version number
listed after each program name was current when we published this Bulletin.
When you order a newer CD-ROM, some of the programs may be newer and
therefore the version number higher.  See the

for ordering information.

</P>
<P>
Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <CODE>compress</CODE>, we use another compression program,
<CODE>gzip</CODE>.  (Such prohibitions on software development are fought by the
League for Programming Freedom; see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC14">What Is the LPF?</A>, for details.)

<P>
You may need to build GNU <CODE>make</CODE> before you build our other software.
Some vendors
supply no <CODE>make</CODE> utility at all and some native <CODE>make</CODE> programs

<H3><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="bull22.html#TOC24">Configuring GNU Software</A></H3>

<P>
We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software
packages in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below,
in this article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same
alternatives for naming machine and system types.
<P>
Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system
all at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package
separately.
<P>
You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.
Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

<LI><CODE>acm</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>acm</CODE> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

<LI><B>Apache</B>   <EM>Also see</EM> <TT>`http://www.apache.org/'</TT>   (SrcCD)

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a successor to the NCSA family of web
servers.  It adds a significant amount of new functionality, has an extensive
API for modular enhancements, is extremely flexible without compromising speed,
and has an active development group and user community.

<LI><B>Autoconf</B>   (SrcCD)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <CODE>m4</CODE> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <CODE>m4</CODE> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

<LI><B>Automake</B>   (SrcCD)

Automake is a tool for generating `Makefile.in's for use with Autoconf.
The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile standards.

<LI><B>BASH</B>   (SrcCD)

GNU's shell, BASH (<B>B</B>ourne <B>A</B>gain <B>SH</B>ell), is compatible with the
Unix <CODE>sh</CODE> and offers many extensions found in <CODE>csh</CODE> and
<CODE>ksh</CODE>.  BASH has job control, <CODE>csh</CODE>-style command history,
command-line editing (with Emacs and <CODE>vi</CODE> modes built-in), and the
ability to rebind keys via the <CODE>readline</CODE> library.  BASH conforms to the
POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

<LI><CODE>bc</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>bc</CODE> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992
standard with several extensions, including multi-character variable names,
an <CODE>else</CODE> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <CODE>dc</CODE> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> is not implemented as a <CODE>dc</CODE> preprocessor.

<LI><B>BFD</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

The <B>B</B>inary <B>F</B>ile <B>D</B>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <CODE>ld</CODE> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet
published on paper).
<P>
At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.

<LI><B>Binutils</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

Binutils includes these programs:
<CODE>ar</CODE>,
<CODE>c<TT>++</TT>filt</CODE>,
<CODE>demangle</CODE>,
<CODE>gas</CODE>,
<CODE>gprof</CODE>,
<CODE>ld</CODE>,
<CODE>nlmconv</CODE>,
<CODE>nm</CODE>,
<CODE>objcopy</CODE>,
<CODE>objdump</CODE>,
<CODE>ranlib</CODE>,
<CODE>size</CODE>,
<CODE>strings</CODE>,
&#38;
<CODE>strip</CODE>.

Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, <CODE>gas</CODE>,
supports the a29k, Alpha, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS,
NS32K, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and attempts to be compatible
with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It can produce
mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility similar to
that in some other assemblers.  GNU's linker, <CODE>ld</CODE>, emits source-line
numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined
references, and interprets a superset of AT&#38;T's Linker Command Language,
which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
<CODE>nlmconv</CODE> converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
<CODE>objdump</CODE> can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and
can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format
read by BFD.

<LI><B>Bison</B>   <EM>See section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC38">GNU Documentation</A></EM> (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<CODE>yacc</CODE>.  Texinfo source for the <CITE>Bison Manual</CITE>
and reference card are included.

<LI><B>C Library</B>   <EM>See section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</A></EM>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman]</B>

The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the underlying
system permits), &#38; most of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.
It is nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2 specification which
guarantees upward compatibility with 4.4BSD &#38; many System V functions.

When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <CODE>malloc</CODE>
which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.

GNU <CODE>stdio</CODE> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help
writing internationalized programs &#38; the user can adopt the
environment the program runs in to conform with local
conventions.  Extended <CODE>getopt</CODE> functions are already used to
parse options, including long options, in many GNU utilities.  The
name lookup functions now are modularized which makes it easier to
select the service which is needed for the specific database &#38; the
document interface makes it easy to add new services.  Texinfo source
for the <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> is included
(see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC38">GNU Documentation</A>).

Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of
systems.  The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not been
updated since development on version 2.0 started, so today it

<LI><B>CLISP</B>   (SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible &#38; Michael Stoll.
It mostly supports the Lisp described by <CITE>Common LISP: The Language
(2nd edition)</CITE> &#38; the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS &#38; a foreign language
interface.  The user interface language (English, German, French) can be
chosen at run time.  An X11 API is available through CLX &#38; Garnet.
CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory &#38; runs on many microcomputers (including
MS-DOS systems, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga 500--4000, &#38; Acorn
RISC PC) &#38; all kinds of Unix systems.

<LI><B>Common Lisp</B>   <EM>Also see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC16">GNUs Flashes</A></EM>   (SrcCD)

GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
&#38; interpreter for Common Lisp.
GCL is very portable &#38; extremely
efficient on a wide class of applications, &#38; compares favorably in
performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover &#38;
symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.
<P>
GCL compiles to C &#38; then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args &#38; one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in
registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted
code &#38; displays source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler
(based on the C profiling tools) counts function calls &#38; the time spent in
each function.
<P>
There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs
in a separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp
computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
interface.
<P>
There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
does PCL (see
"PCL" later in this article).
<P>
GCL version 2.2.1 is released under the GNU Library General Public
License.

<LI><CODE>es</CODE>   (SrcCD)

<CODE>es</CODE> is an extensible shell (based on <CODE>rc</CODE>) with first-class
functions, lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e.,
functions can return values other than just numbers).  <CODE>es</CODE>'s
extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the shell's
built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.  Like <CODE>rc</CODE>,
it is great for both interactive use and scripting, particularly since
its quoting rules are much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C<TT>++</TT>, and
Objective-C; the source
file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.
(Also see "GNAT" later in this article for Ada language supports.)
Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <CODE>object</CODE>, but see "GNUstep" in
section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</A>).
As much as possible,
G<TT>++</TT> is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not
with <CODE>cfront</CODE> (AT&#38;T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.
<P>
GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs many
optimizations.
They include:
automatic register
allocation, common sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain
amount of CSE between basic blocks -- though not all the supported machine
descriptions provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion
from loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
elimination, integration of inline functions &#38; frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf function
optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, the ability to assign
attributes to instructions, &#38; many local optimizations automatically deduced
from the machine description.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <CODE>long long
int</CODE>).  It supports extended floating point (type <CODE>long double</CODE>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional
C, &#38; GNU C extensions (including: nested functions support, nonlocal gotos,
&#38; taking the address of a label).
<P>
GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, &#38; DWARF.

<LI><B>GDB</B>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

GDB, the <B>G</B>NU <B>D</B>e<B>B</B>ugger, is a source-level debugger for C,
C<TT>++</TT>, &#38; Fortran.  It provides partial support for  Modula-2 &#38; Chill.
<P>
GDB can debug both C &#38; C<TT>++</TT>, &#38; will work with executables
made by many different compilers; but, C<TT>++</TT> debugging will have
some limitations if you do not use GCC.

GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
interface.  Two X interfaces (not distributed or maintained by the FSF)
are: <CODE>gdbtk</CODE> (FTP it from <CODE>ftp.cygnus.com</CODE> in directory
<TT>`/pub/gdb'</TT>); and <CODE>xxgdb</CODE> (FTP it from <CODE>ftp.x.org</CODE> in
directory <TT>`/contrib/utilities'</TT>).

Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
(breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
has simulators for the
ARM,
Hitachi H8/300,
Hitachi H8/500,
Hitachi Super-H,
PowerPC,
WDC 65816,
&#38;
Zilog Z8001/2.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <EM>targets</EM> a platform

internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU programs which
do regular expression matching &#38; is available separately.  An alternate
regular expression package, <CODE>rx</CODE>, is faster than <CODE>regex</CODE> in many
cases; we were planning to replace <CODE>regex</CODE> with <CODE>rx</CODE>, but
it is not certain this will happen.

among other features.

<LI><B>Scheme</B>   (SrcCD)

Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed
at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming and
to research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

We now distribute MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the
"Revised^4 Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
(MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source is included.
It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries to bootstrap it exist for:
HP9000 series 300, 400, 700, &#38; 800 (running HP-UX 9.0),
NeXT (NeXT OS 2 or 3.2),
DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
IBM RS/6000 (AIX),
Sun-3 or Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1),
DECstation 3100/5100 (Ultrix 4.0),
Sony NeWS-3250 (NEWS OS 5.01),
&#38;
Intel i386 (MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or NT).
If your system isn't on this list &#38; you don't enjoy the bootstrap
challenge, see "JACAL" earlier in this article.

<H1><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="bull22.html#TOC27">The Deluxe Distribution</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code
and includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, &#38; reference
cards.

</P>
<P>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C<TT>++</TT> Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</P>
<P>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine here.  However, we
can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system -- porting is a separate matter.  (To commission a port,
see the GNU Service Directory; details in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC22">Free Software Support</A>.)
Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an
unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for a common machine.
Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

</P>
<P>
We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with
"Rock Ridge" extensions),
or on one of these tapes in Unix <CODE>tar</CODE> format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -- QIC24,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in c.t. -- QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm c.t., or
DAT 4mm c.t.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</P>
<P>
The manuals included are one each of <CITE>Bison</CITE>, <CITE>Calc</CITE>,
<CITE>GAWK</CITE>, <CITE>GCC</CITE>, <CITE>GNU C Library</CITE>, <CITE>GDB</CITE>,
<CITE>Flex</CITE>, <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</CITE>, <CITE>Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>, <CITE>Make</CITE>, <CITE>Texinfo</CITE>, &#38; <CITE>Termcap</CITE>
manuals; six copies of the <CITE>GNU Emacs</CITE> manual; and ten reference cards
each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB.
<P>
Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs
that have sources of our software &#38; compiler tool
binaries for some systems.
The
CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</P>
<P>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"
section on the
see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>
and send it to:

<H1><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="bull22.html#TOC28">CD-ROMs</A></H1>

<P>
We offer these CD-ROMs:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Several editions of our section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC34">Source Code CD-ROMs</A>.

<LI>January 1997 section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC33">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A>.

<LI>December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

<LI>December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

<LI>December 1993 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</UL>

<P>
Our CDs are in ISO 9660 format &#38; can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each
CD with "Rock Ridge" extensions
&#38; it will look like a regular Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated &#38; otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</P>
<P>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</P>

<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="bull22.html#TOC29">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</A></H3>

<P>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the January 1997 Source CD
set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out of
your own pocket.  The January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

</P>

<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="bull22.html#TOC30">What Do the Different Prices Mean?</A></H4>

<P>
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</P>
<P>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the January 1997 Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.

</P>
<P>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</P>
<P>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
150 Source CDs at that price support an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="bull22.html#TOC31">Why Is There an Individual Price?</A></H4>

<P>
In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

</P>
<P>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="bull22.html#TOC32">Is There a Maximum Price?</A></H4>

<P>
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will
accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a
tax-exempt public charity.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="bull22.html#TOC33">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A></H3>

<P>
The fourth edition of our CD-ROM that has binaries and complete
sources for GNU compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler,
will be available at the end of January 1997.
This enables the people who use these systems to compile GNU and other free
software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.  You can also use
these GNU tools to compile your own C/C<TT>++</TT>/Objective-C programs.
Older editions of this CD are available while supplies last at a reduced
price; see the
see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</P>
<P>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="bull22.html#TOC34">Source Code CD-ROMs</A></H3>

<P>
We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC35">January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs</A>, the newest release, has

programs, bug fixes, &#38; improvements not on the other CDs.

<LI>section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC36">July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs</A>.

<LI>December 1995 Source Code CD-ROMs, see the

see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</UL>

<P>
The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced price
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in
section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC38">GNU Documentation</A>.
<P>
MIT Scheme &#38; much of X11 is <EM>not</EM> on the older Source CDs.

</P>
<P>
There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC33">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A>.

</P>

<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="bull22.html#TOC35">January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs</A></H4>

<P>
The 9th edition of our Source Code CD will be available at the end of January
1997 with two CD-ROM disks.
It has programs, bug fixes, &#38; improvements not on the older Source CDs.
It has these packages, &#38; some manuals that are not part of packages.
The version number of each package listed might be higher on the 9th
edition CD due to new releases being made between now and then.

<H1><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="bull22.html#TOC37">CD-ROM Subscription Service</A></H1>

<P>
Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source CD-ROMs (plus
shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new versions of the
section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC34">Source Code CD-ROMs</A>.  The CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued
(currently twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent).
We do not yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler
Tools Binaries CD.

</P>
<P>
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the
X Window System.  Each edition of the section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC34">Source Code CD-ROMs</A>, has
updated sources for the X Window System.

</P>
<P>
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're
in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you
must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping
Costs" on the
see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="bull22.html#TOC38">GNU Documentation</A></H1>

<P>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online &#38; printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how to
use all the features of each program, &#38; give examples of command use.  GNU
manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both typeset
hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online hypertext
display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals comes
with our software; here are the manuals that we publish as printed books.  See the
see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>,
to order them.

</P>
<P>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <EM>lay-flat</EM>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.  Currently, the
<CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE>,
<CITE>GDB</CITE>,
<CITE>Emacs</CITE>,
<CITE>Emacs Lisp Reference</CITE>,
<CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>,
<CITE>GNU Awk User's Guide</CITE>,
<CITE>Make</CITE>,
&#38;
<CITE>Bison</CITE>
manuals have this binding.
Our other manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC binding.
Our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in by
11in <CITE>Calc</CITE> manual.

</P>
<P>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</P>

<P>
<CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE> (for Version 4.16) tells how to run
your program under GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a
program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>GNU Emacs Manual</CITE> (12th Edition for Version 19.33) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and
regular expression search; how to use special programming modes to write
languages like C<TT>++</TT> and TeX;
how to use the <CODE>tags</CODE> utility;
how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and
other elementary customizations.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE> (October 1995 Edition
1.04) is for people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but
who do want to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you
read it in Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE> (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
and <CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition</CITE> (Japanese Draft
Revision 1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
cover this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The GNU Awk User's Guide</CITE> (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0) tells how
to use <CODE>gawk</CODE>.  It is written for those who have never used <CODE>awk</CODE> and
describes features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.
It clearly delineates those features which are part of POSIX
<CODE>awk</CODE> from <CODE>gawk</CODE> extensions, providing a comprehensive guide
to <CODE>awk</CODE> program portability.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>GNU Make</CITE> (Edition 0.50 for Version 3.75 Beta) describes GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <EM>makefiles</EM>, which specify how a program is to be

introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

<P>
The <CITE>Flex</CITE> manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <CODE>flex</CODE> program to create a
C<TT>++</TT> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</P>

<P>
<CITE>The Bison Manual</CITE> (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE> (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<TT>++</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Texinfo</CITE> manual (Edition 2.24 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation &#38; typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
accented &#38; special characters,
indexes, cross references, &#38; how to catch mistakes.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The Termcap Manual</CITE> (3rd Edition for Version 1.3), often
described as "twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap,"
details the format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal
capabilities, and the process of interrogating a terminal description.
This manual is primarily for programmers.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>C Library Reference Manual</CITE> (Edition 0.08 for Version 2.0)
describes the library's facilities, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" &#38; "system calls."  We are doing small copier runs
of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to
<CODE>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Emacs Calc Manual</CITE> (for Version 2.02) is both a

<H1><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="bull22.html#TOC39">How to Get GNU Software</A></H1>

<P>
All the software &#38; publications from the FSF are
distributed with permission to modify, copy, and redistribute.
One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can also get GNU software directly from the FSF by ordering
CD-ROMs and books.  Such orders provide most of the
funds for the FSF staff to develop more free software, so please support
our work by ordering from the FSF if you can.  See the
see section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC46">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software.
Some are listed in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC9">Free Software Redistributors Donate</A>; also see
section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC41">Free Software for Microcomputers</A>.  Please note that the Free Software
Foundation is <EM>not</EM> affiliated with them in any way and is <EM>not</EM>
responsible for either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of
their responses.

</P>
<P>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partially on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</P>
<P>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of logins.  Please use
one of these other sites that also provide GNU software via FTP (program:
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, user: <CODE>anonymous</CODE>, password: <VAR>your e-mail
address</VAR>, mode: <CODE>binary</CODE>).  If you
can't reach one of them, get the software from GNU's main FTP host,
<CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> (IP address: <CODE>18.159.0.42</CODE>).  More
hosts &#38; details are in <TT>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</TT> &#38;
<TT>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'</TT> on any host.

</P>
<P>
Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE> to
lessen FTP traffic.  Refer to the <TT>`/pub/gnu/=README-about-.gz-files'</TT>

The front of our T-shirt
has the GNU Emacs Lisp code <CODE>(USE 'GNU)</CODE> with "<CODE>()</CODE>" being the
dancing parentheses from the cover of our <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference

<LI><B>Linux Kernel</B>

Linux (named after its main author, Linus Torvalds) is a GPLed kernel that
implements POSIX.1 functionality with SysV &#38; BSD extensions.  Complete
systems based on the Linux kernel are now available for Alpha &#38;
386/486/Pentium/Pentium Pro
machines with one of these buses: ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI.
Since these systems are essentially
variant GNU systems, we call them "GNU/Linux" systems.  An m68k port is in
testing (it runs on high end Amiga &#38; Atari computers).  PowerPC &#38; MIPS
ports are being worked on.
FTP it from
<CODE>tsx-11.mit.edu</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/linux'</TT> (USA)
&#38;
from
<CODE>ftp.funet.fi</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/Linux'</TT> (Europe).
<P>
Ask <CODE>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</CODE> about mailing lists.  See USENET
newsgroups, e.g. <CODE>comp.os.linux.misc</CODE>, for news.

<LI><B>Boston Computer Society</B>

The BCS had numerous free microcomputer programs, including some GNU
programs.
The BCS is now dissolved, but many of the smaller groups operating under
it are expected to continue.
See URL: <TT>`http://www.bcs.org/'</TT>.

<LI><B>GNU Software on the Amiga</B>

Get Amiga ports of many GNU programs via FTP from
<CODE>ftp.funet.fi</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/amiga/gnu'</TT> (Europe).
For info on (or offers to help with) the GCC port and related projects, ask
Leonard Norrgard, <CODE>vinsci@nic.funet.fi</CODE>.  For info on the GNU
Emacs port,
ask Dave Gilbert, <CODE>dgilbert@jaywon.pci.on.ca</CODE>
or
see <TT>`http://www.realtime.tinymush.org/~dgilbert/emacs-19.html'</TT>
for a status update.
You can get more info from a GNU FTP host (listed in section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC39">How to Get GNU Software</A>) in the file <TT>`/pub/gnu/MicrosPorts/Amiga'</TT>.

<LI><B>GNU Software for Atari TOS and Atari Minix</B>

Get Atari ports by anonymous FTP from <CODE>atari.archive.umich.edu</CODE>,
in <TT>`/atari/Gnustuff'</TT>, maintained by Howard Chu,
<CODE>howard@lloyd.com</CODE>.
The GNU software runs on all Atari 68000 and 68030-based systems; a hard
drive and 4 MB RAM minimum are recommended for using the compilers.
See USENET newsgroups, such as <CODE>comp.sys.atari.st.tech</CODE>, for
discussions.

<LI><B>GNU Software for OS/2</B>

Ports of many GNU programs are on the FTP host <CODE>ftp-os2.cdrom.com</CODE>
in <TT>`/pub/os2'</TT>.  One of these is of the GNU
C/C++/Objective-C Compiler to OS/2 2.x and OS/2 Warp, with the GNU
assembler, documentation, and OS/2-specific C libraries.
<P>
This is Eberhard Mattes' <CODE>emx</CODE> port, which also features GDB and many
Unix-related library functions like <CODE>fork</CODE>.  Programs compiled by this
port also run on a 80386 under DOS.  It is in directory
<TT>`/pub/os2/lang/emx09c'</TT>.  <CODE>emx 0.9c</CODE> is a port of GCC 2.7.2.1.

software.  Send these to the address on
the top menu,
or send a citation to <CODE>citations@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<P>
If you use &#38; appreciate our software, please send contributions!
Another good way to help is to buy GNU books, CD-ROMs, and T-shirts.
A business can make a larger contribution by ordering a section <A HREF="bull22.html#SEC27">The Deluxe Distribution</A>.  This is especially helpful if you work for an organization
where the word <EM>donation</EM> is anathema.
Because of the value received, the full dollar amounts of such donations are
not tax-deductible as charitable contributions; however, they may qualify
as a business expense.
