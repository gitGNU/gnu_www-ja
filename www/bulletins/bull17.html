<h3 id="SEC4">What Is the FSF?</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We promote the development and use of free software in all areas using
computers.  Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated
software system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced
"guh-new") that will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of
this system are already being used and distributed.

</p>
<p>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.
You may or may not pay money to get GNU software, but regardless you have
two specific freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program
and give it away to your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to
change a program as you wish, by having full access to source code.  You
can study the source and learn how such programs are written.  You may then
be able to port it, improve it, and share your changes with others.  If you
redistribute GNU software you may charge a distribution fee or give it
away, so long as you include the source
code and the GPL; see section <a href="#SEC5">What Is Copyleft?</a>, for details.

</p>
<p>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to purchase a proprietary system.

</p>
<p>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from this distribution
service.

</p>
<p>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President; <br />
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC5">What Is Copyleft?</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.  But this permits proprietary modifications, denying others
the freedom to use and redistribute improvements; it is contrary to the
intent of increasing the total amount of free software.  To prevent this,
<em>copyleft</em> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and rights become legally inseparable.

</p>
<p>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <em>GNU General Public License</em> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <em>GNU Library General
Public License</em> (LGPL), applies to a few GNU libraries.  This license
permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables under certain
conditions.  The appropriate license is included in all GNU source code
distributions and many manuals.  Printed copies are available upon request.

</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either license appear at the end of each license.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC6">What Is GNU?</h3>

<p>
GNU is to be a complete integrated computational environment: everything
you need to work with a computer, either as a programmer or as a person
in an office or home.  The core is an operating system, which consists
of a central program called a kernel that runs the other programs on the
computer, and a large number of ancillary programs for handling files,
etc.  The FSF is developing an advanced kernel called the Hurd
(see section <a href="#SEC7">What Is the Hurd?</a>).

</p>
<p>
A complete system has tools for programmers, such as compilers and
debuggers.  It also has editors, sketchpads, calendars, calculators,
spreadsheets, databases, electronic mail readers, and Internet navigators.
The FSF already distributes most of the programs used in an operating
system, all the tools regularly used by programmers, and much more.

</p>
<p>
Already, you can set yourself up as an entrepreneur to sell your services
teaching, installing, improving, and modifying this software for others.
Already, you can set yourself up as a programmer or writer who works on
a 80386 or 80486 based computer and use only software that is freely
redistributable.  Already, all the tools you need as a programmer for
editing, compiling, and debugging are free; all the tools you need as a
writer for editing, revising, and typesetting a book are free; many
tools you need for calculations or mathematics are free; and many games
and other applications are free.  Tools for electronic communications
are free.

</p>
<p>
Not only are these tools useful to you, they are useful institutionally.
Since distribution is free, you can pass on copies to other people in
your company or organization without hindrance.  No paperwork.  As a
teacher, you can give programs to your students without fearing that you
are breaking the law.  As a student, you can copy programs for your
friends, and do good by doing so.  If you are poor, you can copy and use
the same software used by the rich; and if you are rich, you can
contribute your improvements to the common heritage.  If you are
ignorant, you can learn.  If you know a great deal, you can help others.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC7">What Is the Hurd?</h3>

<p>
The Hurd will be the foundation of the whole GNU system.
It is built on top of the Mach 3.0 kernel, a free message-passing
kernel developed by CMU.  Mach's virtual memory management and
message-passing facilities are extensively used by the Hurd.
The GNU C Library will provide the Unix system call interface, and will
call the Hurd for needed services it can't provide itself.

</p>
<p>
One goal of the Hurd is to establish a framework for shared development and
maintenance.  The Hurd is like GNU Emacs in that it will allow a broad
range of users to create and share useful projects without knowing much
about the internal workings of the system--projects that might never have
been attempted without freely available source, a well-designed
interface, and a multiserver-based design.

</p>

<p>
Currently there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, the Luna 88k, and several other machines, with more in
progress, including the Amiga and DEC Alpha-3000 machines.  Contact CMU
c/o <code>mach@cs.cmu.edu</code>, if you want to help with one of these or
start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd and GNU C Library is easy (easier
than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier than porting GCC) once a Mach port
to a particular platform exists.

</p>
<p>
Important progress has been made recently; see section <a href="#SEC14">GNUs Flashes</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are significant projects relating to the Hurd for which we need
volunteers.  Experienced system programmers who are interested should send
mail to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the
GNU C Library to new systems is another way to help development of the
Hurd.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC8">Free Software Redistributors Donate</h3>

<p>
by Richard Stallman

</p>
<p>
<b>Austin Code Works</b>, a redistributor of free software, has agreed to
support free software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling
price for the GNU software packages they produce and sell.

</p>
<p>
The <b>Sun Users Group Deutschland</b> has agreed to add a donation to the
FSF to the price of their next CD-ROM of GNU software.  Potential purchasers
will know precisely how much is for the FSF and how much is for SUGD.

</p>
<p>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These two
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.

</p>
<p>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves,
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</p>
<p>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</p>
<p>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits are donated",
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</p>
<p>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler contribute more; major new features and programs contribute the
most.

</p>
<p>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC9">Help from Free Software Companies</h3>

<p>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

</p>
<p>
These free software support companies regularly donate a part of their
income to the Free Software Foundation to support the development of new
GNU programs.  Listing them here is our way of thanking them.

<h3 id="SEC10">Free Software Support</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide any technical support.
Although we create software, we leave it to others to earn a living
providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much as
doctors and lawyers now do; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable entities for which the practitioners charge a distribution
and service fee.

</p>
<p>
The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support
and other consulting services.  It is in the file <tt>`etc/SERVICE'</tt> in the
GNU Emacs distribution, <tt>`SERVICE'</tt> in the GCC distribution and
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE'</tt> on GNU's FTP host
<code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Contact us if you would like a copy or wish to
be listed in it.  Those companies who share their income with the FSF are
listed in section <a href="#SEC9">Help from Free Software Companies</a>.

</p>
<p>
If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.  We have
many Internet mailing lists for bug reports, announcements and questions.
They are also gatewayed into USENET news as the <code>gnu.*</code> newsgroups.
You can request a list of the mailing lists from either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not.  Our task is
so large that we must focus on that which helps the community as a whole;
we do not have the resources to help individuals.  We may send you a patch
for a bug so that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If
your bug report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one
from another user who reads our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use
the Service Directory.

</p>
<p>
Please do not ask us to help you install software or figure out how to use
it--but do tell us how an installation script does not work or where
documentation is unclear.

</p>
<p>
If you have no Internet access, you can get mail and USENET news via
UUCP.  Contact a local UUCP site, or a commercial UUCP site such as:

</p>

<pre>
   UUNET Communications Services
   3110 Fairview Park Drive -- Suite 570
   Falls Church, VA   22042
   USA

   Telephone: +1-800-4UUNET4

   Fax:       +1-703-204-8001
   Electronic-Mail: <code>info@uunet.uu.net</code>
</pre>

<p>
A list of commercial UUCP and Internet service providers is posted
periodically to USENET in the newsgroup <code>news.announce.newusers</code> with
<tt>`Subject: How to become a USENET site'</tt>.  You can also get it via
anonymous FTP from <code>rtfm.mit.edu</code> in the file
<tt>`How_to_become_a_USENET_site'</tt>, in the directory
<tt>`/pub/usenet-by-group/news.announce.newusers'</tt>.

</p>
<p>
When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development or by writing free software
improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can help encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC11">What Is the LPF?</h3>

<p>
The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) aims to protect the freedom
to write software.  This freedom is threatened by "look-and-feel"
interface copyright lawsuits and by software patents.  The LPF does not
endorse free software or the FSF.

</p>
<p>
The League's members include programmers, entrepreneurs, students,
professors, and even software companies.

</p>
<p>
From the League membership form:

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The League for Programming Freedom is a grass-roots organization of
professors, students, business people, programmers, and users dedicated
to bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League is not
opposed to the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on
individual programs.  Our aim is to reverse the recent changes made by
judges in response to special interests.

</p>
<p>
Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers, managers
and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
To join, please send a check and the following information:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

Your name and phone numbers (home, work, or both).

</li><li>

The address to use for League mailings, a few each year (please indicate
whether it is your home address or your work address).

</li><li>

The company you work for, and your position.

</li><li>

Your email address, so the League can contact you for political action.
(If you don't want to be contacted for this, please say so, but please
provide your email address anyway.)

</li><li>

Please mention anything about you which would enable your
endorsement of LPF to impress the public.

</li><li>

Please say whether you would like to help with LPF activities.

</li></ul>

<p>
The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation and is not
itself a free software organization.  The FSF supports the LPF because,
like any software developer smaller than IBM, it is endangered by
software patents.  You are in danger too!  It would be easy to ignore
the problem until you or your employer is sued, but it is more prudent
to organize before that happens.

<h3 id="SEC12">GNU and Other Free Software in Japan</h3>

<p>
Mieko (<code>h-mieko@sra.co.jp</code>) and Nobuyuki Hikichi
(<code>hikichi@sra.co.jp</code>) continue to volunteer for the GNU
Project in Japan.  They translate each issue of this Bulletin into
Japanese and distribute it widely, along with their translation of the
GNU General Public License Version 2.  This translation of the GPL is
authorized by the FSF and is available by anonymous FTP from
<code>srawgw.sra.co.jp</code> in <code>/pub/gnu/local-fix/GPL2-j</code>.
They are working on a formal translation of the GNU Library General
Public License.  They also solicit donations and offer GNU software
consulting.

</p>
<p>
<code>nepoch</code> (the Japanese versions of Epoch) and MULE are available and
widely used in Japan.  MULE (the MULtilingual Enhancement of GNU Emacs) can
handle many character sets at once.  Eventually its features will be merged
into the FSF's version of Emacs.  The FSF does not distribute
<code>nepoch</code>, but MULE is available on the section <a href="#SEC30">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.  You
can also FTP it from <code>sh.wide.ad.jp</code> in <code>/JAPAN/mule</code> or
<code>etlport.etl.go.jp</code> in <code>/pub/mule</code>.  See section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>,
for more information about MULE.

The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, ICOT, has released
the "ICOT Free Software (IFS)" distribution.  The famous Fifth Generation
Computing System project produced this distribution, which includes over 80
systems for symbol processing, knowledge processing, problem solving,
inference, and natural language processing.  Many of them are based on
parallel logic programming.  For details, contact
<code>ifs@icot.or.jp</code>.

</p>
<p>
There is a mailing list in Japan to discuss both hardware and software
which is under the GNU General Public License.  This list provides
information about making your own computer system.  The main language used
on the list is Japanese.  If you are interested in getting information or
having discussions in English, contact <code>mka@apricot.juice.or.jp</code>
or <code>ishiz@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp</code>.

</p>
<p>
Many groups in Japan now distribute GNU software.  They include JUG, a PC
user group; ASCII, a periodical and book publisher; the Fujitsu FM
Towns users group; and SRA's special GNU support group, called Wingnut, who
also purchased the first Deluxe package in Japan.  (Since then, there have
been several other purchases of the Deluxe package in Japan.)

</p>
<p>
Anonymous UUCP is available until the end of December, 1994.  After that it
will be canceled due to a lack of disk space, time and the ease with which
GNU software can be obtained via FTP and on CD-ROM and other media.  Since
the service was started 5 years ago, over 300 tapes have been made, and
over 600 hosts have made more than 20,000 calls to the UUCP server to get
GNU and other free software.  For more information, contact
<code>toku@dit.co.jp</code>.

</p>
<p>
It is easy to place an order directly with the FSF from Japan, thus funding
new code.  To get an FSF Order Form written in Japanese, ask
<code>japan-fsf-orders@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  There are also two toll-free
Fax numbers for use in Japan (see
the top menu).
We encourage you to buy
software on tapes or CDs: for example, every 150 tape orders allows FSF to
hire a programmer for a year to write more free software.

<h3 id="SEC13">Announcing the Dictionary Project</h3>

<p>
The FSF has a copy of the <cite>Century Dictionary</cite>, an unabridged
dictionary now in the public domain, and we are planning to put it online.
We tried OCR, but it wasn't reliable enough.  So we're looking for
volunteers to type it in--20 pages per volunteer.  We estimate that takes
around 45 hours if you type reasonably fast, including proofreading.

</p>
<p>
If you'd like to volunteer, please send mail to
<code>dictionary@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>.  We'll send you 20 xeroxed pages
plus the description of the online dictionary format.  (Be <em>very</em>
careful to follow the format.)

</p>
<p>
This project provides a way for people without programming skills or money
to contribute to the GNU Project.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC14">GNUs Flashes</h3>


<ul>

<li><b>Hurd</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC7">What Is the Hurd?</a>)

The Hurd runs GNU Hello!  The Hurd has successfully bootstrapped, which
means that it loads the core servers and it can run simple utilities.  At
press time, it ran a simple shell, a simple <code>ps</code>, most of the
shellutils, most of the textutils and all of the fileutils.  Progress is
being made so rapidly that by the time you read this it probably does much
more.

For a complete non-network system, we still need to finish the support for
signals (although some simple test programs that use signals already work),
the terminal driver, and the local sockets code (at least for pipes).  We
have a mailing list to distribute announcements about progress; send mail
to <code>hurd-ann-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code> to be added to it.

</li><li><b>FSF Now Distributing X11R6, as well as X11R5</b>

FSF updated the section <a href="#SEC25">X11 Tapes</a> and the May 1994 section <a href="#SEC30">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>
to the just-released X11R6.  This is the first major update since X11R5 was
released in September, 1991.  We will distribute X11R5 on tape until X11R6
is stable, and on the section <a href="#SEC31">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, while
supplies last.

</li><li><b>4.4BSD--Lite</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC26">Berkeley 4.4BSD--Lite Tape</a>)

The FSF has begun distributing 4.4BSD--Lite and dropped the old
Berkeley Networking 2 tape.  The "Lite" refers to the omittance of some
proprietary files that still remain in the full 4.4BSD distribution.
However, 4.4BSD--Lite is considerably more complete than the previous
Networking 2 release.

</li><li><b>Common Lisp Freed!</b>

GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has been added.  Previously, GCL had distribution
terms under which each user had to have a signed paper contract on file.
However, the authors recently decided to switch to the GPL.  See
section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>, and section <a
href="#SEC23">Emacs Tape</a>, for more information.

</li><li><b>Manual Updated since Last Bulletin</b>

The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual has been updated.  The new edition
includes bug fixes and additional information.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>New Program on the Languages Tape</b>

Octave has been added.  See section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a> and
section <a href="#SEC21">Languages Tape</a>, for more information.

</li><li><b>New Programs on the Utilities Tape</b>

<code>ed</code> has been added.  <code>elvis</code> has been replaced by <code>nvi</code>.
See section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a> and section <a href="#SEC22">Utilities Tape</a>, for more information.

</li><li><b>New Programs on the Source Code CD-ROM</b>

This CD-ROM has all the new programs and changes on the tapes.  X11R6 has
also replaced X11R5.  See section <a href="#SEC30">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, for details.

</li><li><b>New GNU Column in New Linux Magazine</b>

Arnold Robbins, <code>arnold@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>, a long-time volunteer
for the GNU project, is the author of "What's GNU?", a regular column in
the new monthly magazine <cite>Linux Journal</cite>.  The column discusses the
GNU project, its software and other interesting free software.  It is
available from the publishers of <cite>Linux Journal</cite>.  Contact Arnold or
Phil Hughes, <code>phil@fylz.com</code>, the publisher of <cite>Linux
Journal</cite> for more information.

</li><li><b>Experimental Tape Takes a Recess</b>

We are not currently distributing the Experimental Tape because most of the
programs that were on it are now stable.  GCC, GAS, Binutils, libg<tt>++</tt>,
and the C Library are now on the section <a href="#SEC21">Languages Tape</a>, replacing prior
releases.  Oleo &#38; GNU Graphics are now on the section <a href="#SEC22">Utilities Tape</a>.

</li><li><b>Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</b>

We now have a CD-ROM that contains executables for the GNU compiler tools
for some systems that don't normally come with a compiler.  This allows
users of those systems to compile GNU and other free software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.  See section <a
href="#SEC32">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>, for more details,
including which platforms are supported.

We hope to include more systems with each update of this CD-ROM.  If you
can help build binaries for new systems, or have a system to suggest,
please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li><b>Source CD-ROM Subscriptions</b>

We are now offering a subscription service for the Source Code CD-ROM in
addition to our tape subscription service.  For the price of 3 CD-ROMs
(plus any shipping costs) you get the next 4 that we make.  Presently we
make two updates a year, but we may go to more frequent updates.
See section <a href="#SEC38">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</a>.

</li><li><b>FSF Accepts Orders and Donations via Fax</b>

You can now send orders and donations to the FSF by fax.  Please fax in a
completed
see section <a href="#SEC48">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
including credit card information, since orders must
be prepaid.  We do <em>not</em> accept purchase orders.  The number is
<tt>+</tt>1--617--492--9057 in the U.S. and everywhere else except Japan.
In Japan, the fax numbers are toll-free: 0031--13--2473 (KDD) and
0066--3382--0158 (IDC).

</li><li><b>FSF T-shirts Improved!</b>

We have added a copy of the GNU General Public License to the back of our
T-shirt, which used to be blank.  See section <a href="#SEC43">FSF T-shirt</a>.

</li><li><b>Informal "GCC Consortium"</b>

A group of companies including Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments and
Analog Devices have pooled funds to support central maintenance of GNU
CC, which is now done by Richard Kenner of New York University.

This task is to take responsibility for fixing bugs,
integrating and cleaning up contributions, making releases and writing high
priority improvements.

</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</h3>

<p>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</p>

<ul>
<li>

<code>makeinfo</code> <b>and the World Wide Web</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

<code>makeinfo</code> is being modified to translate Texinfo source files into
HTML documents that can be displayed from the Internet's World Wide Web.

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

Planned development for GNU Common Lisp (GCL) includes moving to the ANSI
standard, adding a byte compiler with source level debugging, and adding a
windowing interface.  A new compiler is being tested; it will make all
functions pass arguments on the C stack and return values in a standard
register with additional locations when necessary.  This will speed up
other function calls and funcalling (critical for object oriented work).
Contributors to any of these areas would be helpful; contact
<code>schelter@math.utexas.edu</code>.

</li><li>

<b>GNU Emacs</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor.
Features planned for future releases of Emacs include: different visibility
conditions for regions and for multiple windows showing the same buffer;
incrementally saving the undo history in a file, so that you can undo older
changes in the history; support for variable-width fonts; and support for
wide character sets including all the world's major languages.

</li><li>

<b>C Interpreter</b>

The FSF is adding interpreter facilities to the GNU compiler and debugger.
This task is partly finished.  GCC now generates byte code (for all
supported languages: C, C<tt>++</tt> and Objective-C) and another package
interprets it.

To make this work usable, we need to add features to GDB to load the byte
code dynamically.  We also would like C compiler support for compiling just
a specified few functions in a file.  Due to limited resources, the FSF
cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GAS</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

The GNU assembler is in the process of being rewritten to fully use the BFD
library.  Currently BFD is used only on some platforms.
When this work is finished, porting the entire compiler support
suite (GAS and Binutils) to new platforms should be easier.
Forthcoming versions will include support for the HP--PA, DEC Alpha
(running OSF/1), RS/6000 and PowerPC processors.

</li><li>

<b>GCC</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

New front ends for GCC are being developed, but they are not yet part of
GCC.  A front end for Fortran is now in alpha test and is approaching
completion, and a front end for Ada (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is
available via anonymous FTP from <code>cs.nyu.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/gnat'</tt>,
though it is not yet stable.  News about GNAT is posted to the USENET
newsgroup <code>comp.lang.ada</code>.  Volunteers are also developing a
Pascal front end.

</li><li>

<b>GNU Fortran</b>         (For info on <code>f2c</code> &#38; GCC, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) is in "private" alpha test (testing by a small
group of experts) and is not yet publicly released.  Until <code>g77</code> is
fully released to the public, we ask people to use <code>f2c</code> (a
Fortran-to-C translator) with GCC.  As <code>g77</code> uses a lot of these tools
(the <code>f2c</code> libraries and the GCC back end), using them and reporting
any problems you find will help speed the release of <code>g77</code>.

The primary focus of the alpha test is to test the <code>g77</code> front end,
since that has most of the new code.  The secondary focus of the alpha test
is to test the integration between the front end and the back end.
Currently, this is where most of the bugs seem to be.  The tertiary focus
is the quality of code generated by the GNU back end for Fortran.

We hope to have a <code>g77</code> beta release in summer 1994, as part of the
regular compiler distribution.
A mailing list exists for announcements about <code>g77</code>.  To subscribe,
ask <code>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  To contact the
author and maintainer of <code>g77</code>, write to
<code>fortran@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li>

<b>Ghostscript</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

Ghostscript 2.6.2, consisting of version 2.6.1 with bug fixes, will be
released and distributed by FSF sometime in late 1994.  Ghostscript 3.0
will be released and distributed by FSF in the second quarter of 1995; a
future GNU's Bulletin will have a more definite date.  It will implement
the full PostScript Level 2 language except for LZW compression, which
can't be freely implemented because of software patents.  (Prohibitions
like this on programming are what the League for Programming Freedom is
fighting.  See section <a href="#SEC11">What Is the LPF?</a>, for details.)

</li><li><b>GSview for Windows and OS/2</b>         (Also see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

A new version of Russell Lang's Ghostview for Windows will be released
during the second quarter of 1994.  The name has been changed to "GSview
for Windows" in order to avoid confusion with Tim Theisen's Ghostview.  An
OS/2 port called "PM GSview" will be released at the same time.  For more
information, contact Russell at <code>rjl@monu1.cc.monash.edu.au</code>.

</li><li><code>gmp</code>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

The GNU mp library, version 2.0, (due out soon) has arbitrary precision
floating point arithmetic, is more portable, and is up to 4 times
faster than previous versions.

</li><li>

<b>Oleo</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

Volunteers are writing an Oleo manual and extensions to the Oleo interface.

</li><li>

<b>rx</b>, a faster regular expression library

Tom Lord has written a new regular expression library which is faster
than the current library we use.  Currently it is only being distributed
with <code>sed</code>; eventually we will distribute it as a separate package as
well.
This new library is nearly a drop-in replacement for the current regex
library used by the GNU Project, but it needs a few more features before it
can be used in Emacs.

</li><li>

<b>Smalltalk</b>         (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>)

Future versions will contain significant performance improvements, ability
to use the Smalltalk interpreter as a subroutine, better interfaces to the
MIT X Window System, ability to represent and manipulate C data structures
in Smalltalk, conditional compilation facilities, large integer support,
exceptions, and weak references &#38; finalization support.

</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC16">Freely Available Texts</h3>

<p>
Freely redistributable information isn't just software.  Here are a few
groups providing various books, historical documents, and more.  Please let
either address on
the top menu
know of additional entries.  You can FTP
a more complete list
in file <tt>`/pub/gnu/FreelyAvailableTexts'</tt>
from <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</p>

<ul>
<li>

<b>FreeLore</b>

A goal of the FreeLore Project is to do "serious" book-length writing,
and give it away for free.  John Goodwin is now concentrating on writing
freelore and to show what it is by example (not unlike the FSF).  You can
FTP his results from <code>world.std.com</code> in
<tt>`/obi/Networking/John.Goodwin'</tt>.  To volunteer, contact
<code>jgoodwin@delphi.fnal.gov</code>.

</li><li>

<b>The Online Book Initiative (OBI)</b>

OBI focuses on freely redistributable books, reference material, conference
proceedings, catalogues, etc.  OBI has about 400MB of (mostly compressed)
text online, ranging from poetry to standards documents to novels.  You may
anonymous FTP texts from <code>obi.std.com</code> in <tt>`/obi'</tt>.
You can also dial <code>world.std.com</code> with a modem
(617-739-9753, 8N1)
and create an account to access this information (login as <code>new</code>).
Accounts on <code>world</code> are charged for their connect time (ask
<code>info@world.std.com</code> for details).

</li><li>

<b>Project Gutenberg</b>

Project Gutenberg is the brainchild of Michael Hart.  Professor Hart's
hope for success derives from the nature of what he calls `Replicator
Technology'.  Once anything is stored in a computer, it can be reproduced
indefinitely, making it available to all who want it.
Texts from Project Gutenberg are available at a number of FTP sites,
including <code>mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu</code> in file <tt>`/etext'</tt> and
<code>oes.orst.edu</code> in file <tt>`/pub/almanac/etext'</tt>.  To find out how
to obtain text via e-mail, send the word `HELP' in the body of a message to
<code>BITFTP%PUCC.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu</code>.  Or look at
<code>bit.listserv.gutnberg</code>, a USENET newsgroup.  For more
information, write to
<code>dircompg@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>Project Runeberg</b>

Project Runeberg publishes works of literature and art which meet three
criteria: they are machine-readable; in a Scandinavian language (such as
Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Faroese) or created by an artist
from a Nordic country; and free for duplication and distribution by anyone
and for any purpose.
Project Runeberg was founded in March 1993, inspired by Project
Gutenberg.  Coordinated by Lars Aronsson, Project Runeberg is an
activity of Lysator, a student computer club at Linkoping University
in Linkoping, Sweden.

FTP from host <code>ftp.lysator.liu.se</code> in

</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC17">GNU Documentation</h3>

<p>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online and printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain the underlying concepts, describe how
to use all the features of each program, and give examples of command use.
GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both
typeset hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system, and online
hypertext-like display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these
manuals comes with our software, and they are available in hardcopy; see
the
see section <a href="#SEC48">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <em>lay-flat</em>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  Each book has an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.  Currently, the <cite>Emacs</cite>, <cite>GDB</cite>, <cite>Emacs Lisp Reference</cite>,
<cite>GAWK</cite>, <cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Flex</cite>, <cite>Bison</cite>, and <cite>Texinfo</cite>
manuals have this binding.  The other GNU manuals are also bound so they
lie flat when opened, using a GBC binding.  All of our manuals are
7in by 9.25in except the <cite>Calc</cite> manual, which is
8.5in by 11in.

</p>
<p>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Manual</cite> (9th Edition for Version 19) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and
regular expression search, how to use special modes for programming in
languages like C<tt>++</tt> and TeX, how to use the <code>tags</code> utility, how
to compile and correct code, how to make your own keybindings, and other
elementary customizations.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> (Edition 4.09 for Version 4.9) tells how to use
the GNU Debugger, run your program under debugger control, examine and
alter data, modify a program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU
Emacs.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 2.3 for Version 19.23)
covers this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GAWK Manual</cite> (Edition 0.16 for Version 2.16) tells how to use the
GNU implementation of <code>awk</code>.  It is written for those who have never
used <code>awk</code> and describes the features of this powerful string and
record manipulation language.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Make Manual</cite> (Edition 0.43 for Version 3.68) describes GNU
<code>make</code>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <em>makefiles</em>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Flex Manual</cite> (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) tells you how to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <code>flex</code> program to create a
C<tt>++</tt> or C-coded scanner that will recognize the patterns described.
You need no prior knowledge of scanner generators.

</p>

<p>
The <cite>Bison Manual</cite> (December 1993 Edition for Version 1.23) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> (October 1993 Edition for Version 2.5)
explains how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.
It describes new features and incompatibilities of the compiler, but people
not familiar with C will also need a good reference on the C programming
language.  This manual also covers G<tt>++</tt>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Texinfo Manual</cite> (Edition 2.19 for Version 3) explains the markup
language used to generate both the online Info documentation and typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, how to use Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs, and
how to catch mistakes.  This second edition describes over 50 new commands.

</p>

<p>
The <cite>Termcap Manual</cite> (2nd Edition for Version 1.2), often described as
"twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details the
format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal capabilities,
and the process of interrogating a terminal description.  This manual is
primarily for programmers.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>C Library Reference Manual</cite> (June 1993 Edition for Version 1.07)
describes most of the facilities of the GNU C library, including both what
Unix calls "library functions" and "system calls."  We are doing
limited copier runs of this manual until it becomes more stable.  It is
new, and needs corrections and improvements.  Please send them to
<code>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Calc Manual</cite> (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) includes both
a tutorial and a reference manual for Calc.  It describes how to do
ordinary arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms
of mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

<b>Configuring GNU Software:</b>

</p>
<p>
We are using a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages in
order to compile them, which uses the <code>autoconf</code> program.  All GNU
software supports the same alternatives for naming machine and system
types.  This makes it possible to configure any and all GNU software in the
same manner.

</p>
<p>
The configuration scheme also supports configuring a directory containing
several GNU packages with one command.  When the GNU system is complete it
will be possible to configure and build the entire system at once,
eliminating the need to separately configure each individual package.

</p>
<p>
The configuration scheme can also specify both the host and target system,
so you can easily configure and build cross-compilation tools.

</p>

<p>
<b>GNU software currently available:</b>

</p>
<p>
(For new features and coming programs, see section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>.)

</p>

<ul>

<li><code>acm</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>acm</code> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that
runs under the MIT X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.  Eventually we
hope to turn this into a more general purpose flight simulator.

</li><li><b>Autoconf</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <code>m4</code> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <code>m4</code> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

</li><li><b>BASH</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU shell, BASH (<b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell), is compatible with
the Unix <code>sh</code> and offers many extensions found in <code>csh</code> and
<code>ksh</code>.  BASH has job control, <code>csh</code>-style command history, and
command-line editing (with Emacs and <code>vi</code> modes built-in, and the
ability to rebind keys) via the <b>readline</b> library.  BASH conforms to
the POSIX 1003.2 shell specification.

</li><li><code>bc</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>bc</code> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision.
GNU <code>bc</code> follows the POSIX 1003.2
draft
standard, with several extensions including multi-character variable names,
an <code>else</code> statement and full Boolean expressions.  GNU <code>bc</code> does
not require the separate <code>dc</code> program.

</li><li><b>BFD</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The <b>B</b>inary <b>F</b>ile <b>D</b>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g. <code>ld</code> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
ELF &#38; OSF-Rose.  BFD comes with source for Texinfo documentation (not yet
published on paper).

Presently BFD is not distributed separately because it is not yet
completely stable; however, it is included with packages that use it.

</li><li><b>Binutils</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

Binutils includes the programs:
<code>ar</code>,
<code>c<tt>++</tt>filt</code>,
<code>demangle</code>,
<code>gprof</code>,
<code>ld</code>,
<code>nlmconv</code>,
<code>nm</code>,
<code>objcopy</code>,
<code>objdump</code>,
<code>ranlib</code>,
<code>size</code>,
<code>strings</code>,
&#38;
<code>strip</code>.

Binutils Version 2 is completely rewritten to use the BFD library.  The GNU
linker <code>ld</code> emits source-line numbered error messages for
multiply-defined symbols and undefined references.  It interprets a
superset of the AT&#38;T Linker Command Language, which gives general control
over where segments are placed in memory.  <code>nlmconv</code> converts object
files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.  The <code>objdump</code> program can
disassemble code for a29k, ALPHA, H8/300, H8/500, HP--PA, i386, i960, m68k,
m88k, MIPS, SH, SPARC, &#38; Z8000 processors, and can display other data such
as symbols and relocations from any file format understood by BFD.

</li><li><b>Bison</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCompT)

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<code>yacc</code>.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Bison Manual</cite>
and reference card are included.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GNU C Library</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989 and POSIX 1003.1-1990 and has most
of the functions specified in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible
with 4.4BSD and includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

The C Library will perform many functions of the Unix system calls in
the Hurd.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <code>malloc</code> which
wastes less memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU regular-expression
functions (regex) now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2
standard.

GNU <code>stdio</code> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <code>fmemopen</code> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <code>printf</code> formats to use a C function you have written.  For
example, you can safely use format strings from user input to implement
a <code>printf</code>-like function for another programming language.
Extended <code>getopt</code> functions are already used to parse options,
including long options, in many GNU utilities.

Version 1.08 has just been released, adding support for Sun RPC,
<code>mmap</code> and friends, and compatibility with several more traditional
Unix functions.  It runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris
2), HP 9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation
(Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486 (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2 &#38;
SCO ODT 2.0), Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3) &#38; SGI (Irix 4).  Texinfo
source for the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> is included
(see section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>); the manual still needs updating.

</li><li><b>GNU C<tt>++</tt> Library</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU C<tt>++</tt> library (libg<tt>++</tt>) is an extensive collection of C<tt>++</tt>
<cite>forest</cite> classes, a new IOStream library for input/output routines,
and support tools for use with G<tt>++</tt>.  Among the classes supported are
Obstacks, multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers,
arbitrary length Strings, BitSets and BitStrings.  There is also a set of
pseudo-generic prototype files for generating common container
classes.  Texinfo source for partial documentation is included
(not yet published on paper).

</li><li><b>Calc</b>         (EmcsT, SrcCD)

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator and mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  If
you wish, you can use Calc just as a simple four-function calculator, but
it provides additional features including choice of algebraic or RPN
(stack-based) entry, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and financial
functions, arbitrary precision, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, dates,
times, infinities, sets, algebraic simplification, differentiation, and
integration.  It also outputs to <code>gnuplot</code>.  Calc comes with Texinfo
source for a reference card and the <cite>Calc Manual</cite>, which serves as a
tutorial and reference.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GNU Chess</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Chess lets the computer play a full game of chess with you.  It
runs on most platforms and has dumb terminal, "curses", and X terminal
interfaces.

GNU Chess implements many specialized features including the null move
heuristic, a hash table with aging, the history heuristic (another form of
the earlier killer heuristic), caching of static evaluations, and a
database which lets it play the first several moves in the game quickly.

Recent improvements include better heuristics, faster evaluation, thinking
on opponent's time, Swedish and German language support, support for more
book formats, a rudimentary Bobby Fischer clock, and bug fixes.

GNU Chess is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft, Mike McGann, Chua Kong
Sian, and Tim Mann on behalf of the FSF.

</li><li><b>CLISP</b>         (EmcsT, SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) by Bruno
Haible and Michael Stoll.  It mostly supports the Lisp described by
<cite>Common LISP: The Language (1st edition)</cite>.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a subset of CLOS and, for some machines, a
screen editor.  It has user interfaces in English &#38; German (&#38; French soon),
chooseable at compile time.  Major packages that run in CLISP include PCL
and, on Unix machines, CLX &#38; Garnet.  CLISP needs only 1.5 MB of memory and
runs on many microcomputers (including the Atari ST, Amiga
500--4000, most MS-DOS systems &#38; OS/2) &#38; some Unix workstations (Linux,
Sun4, Sun386, HP9000/800, SGI, Sun3 and others).

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>         (EmcsT, SrcCD)

GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp.
It is very portable and extremely efficient on a wide class of
applications.  It compares favorably in performance with commercial Lisps
on several large theorem prover and symbolic algebra systems.  It
supports the CLtL1 specification but is moving towards the proposed ANSI
definition.  It is based on AKCL and KCL.  KCL was written by Taiichi Yuasa
and Masami Hagiya in 1984, and AKCL has been developed by William Schelter
since 1987.

GCL compiles to C and then uses the native optimizing C compilers (e.g.
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args and one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args and returning 1 value, so it cannot
really be any more efficient on such calls.  It has a conservative GC which
allows great freedom for the C compiler to put Lisp values in arbitrary
registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code, with
display of source code in the other Emacs window.  It has profiling tools
based on the C profiling tools, which count function calls and percentage
of time.  CLX works with GCL.  There is an Xlib interface via C.  PCL
worked with earlier versions.  See section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for about
GCL.

GCL version 1.0 is being released under the GNU Library General Public
License.  (FTP <tt>`/pub/gnu/gcl.README'</tt> on
<code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.)  Get source from <code>ftp.cli.com</code>.  For
details ask <code>schelter@math.utexas.edu</code>.

</li><li><code>cpio</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>cpio</code> is an alternative archive program with all the features of SVR4
<code>cpio</code>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite>
standard.  <code>mt</code>, a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
<code>cpio</code>.

</li><li><b>CVS</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

CVS, the Concurrent Version System, manages software revision and release
control in a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group environment.  It
works best in conjunction with RCS versions 4 and above, but will parse
older RCS formats with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See Berliner,
Brian, "CVS-II: Parallelizing Software Development," <cite>Proceedings of
the Winter 1990 USENIX Association Conference</cite>.  To find out how to get a
copy of this report, ask <code>office@usenix.org</code>.

</li><li><code>dc</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>dc</code> is an RPN calculator.  GNU <code>bc</code> does not require a separate
<code>dc</code> program to run.  This version of <code>dc</code> will eventually be
merged with GNU <code>bc</code>.

</li><li><b>DejaGnu</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs that provides a single
front end for all tests.  The framework's flexibility and consistency make
it easy to write tests for any program.  DejaGnu comes with <code>expect</code>,
which runs scripts to conduct dialogs with programs; and Tcl, which is an
embeddable scripting language.  The FSF hopes to replace Tcl with a cleaner
programming language someday.

</li><li>

<b>Demacs, GNU Emacs for MS-DOS</b>         (EmcsD)

Manabu Higashida and Hirano Satoshi have released Demacs, a GNU
Emacs port for 386/486 based MS-DOS machines.
It is compatible
with XMS memory managers and VCPI, but not yet with Microsoft Windows
extended mode or other DPMI managers.
Anonymous FTP it from
<code>oak.oakland.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/msdos/demacs'</tt> (USA) &#38;
<code>utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> in <tt>`/GNU/demacs'</tt> (Japan).  For an
FTP site list and the current status of Demacs, email to
<code>demacs@sigmath.osaka-u.ac.jp</code>.  For details, FTP the <tt>`README'</tt>
file.

The FSF is offering Demacs on diskette.  We will replace it with GNU
Emacs 19, as soon as the MS-DOS port is ready.  See section <a href="#SEC35">Emacs Diskettes</a>.

</li><li><b>Diffutils</b>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>diff</code> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
Diffutils package contains <code>diff</code>, <code>diff3</code>, <code>sdiff</code>,
and <code>cmp</code>.

These improvements have recently been made to Diffutils:
A new heuristic for <code>diff</code> greatly reduces the time needed to
compare large input files that contain many differences,
and produces output that is usually smaller rather than larger.
New <code>diff</code> options give detailed control over output format,
e.g. to provide if-then-else output for programming languages other than C.
Message wordings and the definition of "white space" have been
revised for compatibility with the POSIX.2 standard (ISO/IEC
9945-2:1993).

</li><li><b>DJGPP</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD)

DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G<tt>++</tt> 2.5.7 (see the GCC item in this section)
to the i386 MS-DOS platform.  The DJGPP package also contains a 32-bit
80386 DOS extender with symbolic debugger; development libraries; and ports
of Bison, <code>flex</code>, GAS, and the GNU Binutils.  Full source code is
provided.
It requires at least 5MB of hard disk space to install and 512K
of RAM to use.
It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768),
XMS &#38; VDISK memory allocation,
<code>himem.sys</code>,
VCPI (e.g. QEMM, DESQview, &#38; 386MAX), and
DPMI (e.g. Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, &#38; QDPMI).
The FSF offers it on the section <a href="#SEC34">DJGPP Diskettes</a>,
and on the section <a href="#SEC32">Compiler Tools Binaries
CD-ROM</a>.  Or FTP file <tt>`/pub/msdos/djgpp'</tt> from
<code>oak.oakland.edu</code> (or another SimTel mirror site).  Ask
<code>djgpp-request@sun.soe.clarkson.edu</code> to join a mailing list for
DJGPP users.

</li><li><code>dld</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>dld</code> is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your
program with the <code>dld</code> library allows you to dynamically load object
files into the running binary.  Currently supported are VAX (Ultrix), Sun 3
(SunOS 3.4 &#38; 4.0), SPARC (SunOS 4.0), Sequent Symmetry (Dynix), &#38; Atari ST.

</li><li><code>doschk</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

This program is intended as a utility to help software developers ensure
that their source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms with
14-character filenames and on MS-DOS with 8+3 character filenames.

</li><li><code>ecc</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>ecc</code> is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking program, which can
correct three byte errors in a block of 255 bytes and detect more severe
errors.  Contact <code>paulf@Stanford.EDU</code> for more information.

</li><li><code>ed</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Ed is the standard text editor.

</li><li><b>Elib</b>         (EmcsT, SrcCD)

This is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>

In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
customizable real-time display editor.  GNU Emacs is his second
implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated into the
editor--for writing extensions, and provides an interface to the MIT X
Window System.  In addition to its powerful native command set, extensions
which emulate other popular editors are distributed: vi, EDT (DEC's VMS
editor) and Gosling (aka Unipress) Emacs.  It has many other features which
make it a full computing support environment.  Source for the
<cite>GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, the <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, and a
reference card come with the software.
See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

New features in Emacs 19 include: multiple X windows ("frames" to
Emacs), with either a separate X window for the minibuffer or a
minibuffer attached to each X window;
property lists associated with regions of text in a buffer;
multiple fonts and colors defined by those properties;
simplified and improved processing of function keys, mouse clicks and

improved buffer allocation, using a new mechanism capable of returning
storage to the system when a buffer is killed;
interfacing with the X resource manager;
GNU configuration scheme support;
good RCS support;
&#38;
many updated libraries.

New features in Emacs 19.23 include X toolkit support,
dialog boxes,

systems, we will augment the list.  Also see section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>.

</li><li><code>es</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>es</code> is an extensible shell based on <code>rc</code> that has
first class functions, lexical scope, an exception system, and
rich return values (i.e. functions can return values other than just
numbers).  Like <code>rc</code>, it is great for both interactive use and for
scripting, particularly because its quoting rules are much less baroque
than the C or Bourne shells.

Only some of these are on the section <a href="#SEC36">Selected Utilities Diskettes</a>.

</li><li><code>find</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>find</code> is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations on
them.  Also included are <code>xargs</code>, which applies a command to a
list of files, and <code>locate</code>, which scans a database for file
names that match a pattern.

</li><li><b>Finger</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger <em>server</em>
host.  This host collects information about who is logged in to other hosts
at that site.  If a user at site A wants to know about users logged on
at site B, a single query to any machine at the site will return
complete information.

</li><li><code>flex</code>         (LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

<code>flex</code> is a replacement for the <code>lex</code> scanner generator.
<code>flex</code> was written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and generates far more efficient scanners than <code>lex</code> does.  Texinfo
source for the <cite>Flex Manual</cite> and reference card are included.
See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>Fontutils</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The fontutils create fonts for use with Ghostscript or TeX, starting
with a scanned type image and converting the bitmaps to outlines.  They
also contain general conversion programs and other utilities.

</li><li><b>GAS</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

GAS is the GNU assembler.
Native assembly works for many systems, including:
Sun 3, 4, &#38; SPARC (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2);
i386 (AIX, 386BSD, BSDI/386, Linux, SCO, Unixware);
m68k (BSD, HP-UX, Convergent Technologies SysV);
MIPS (Ultrix, Irix);
Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500; &#38;
VAX (BSD, Ultrix, VMS).
Cross assembling can be done for most of the above systems, plus:
i386 (SCO, go32 MS-DOS/DJGPP);
ebmon29k;
Hitachi H8/300;
i960 (b.out, COFF);
MIPS ECOFF (Ultrix, Iris, MIPS Magnum);
Nindy 960;
vxworks (68k or 960); &#38;
Zilog Z8000.
See section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for future releases of GAS.

</li><li><b>GAWK</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

GAWK is upwardly compatible with the System V Release 4 and POSIX versions
of <code>awk</code>.  It also provides several useful extensions not found in
other <code>awk</code> implementations.  Texinfo source for the <cite>GAWK
Manual</cite> comes with the software.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>GCC</b>         (BinCD, DjgppD, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCompT)

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports three languages: C, C<tt>++</tt> and
Objective-C; the source file name suffix or a compiler option selects the
language.  The front end support for Objective-C was donated by NeXT.  The
runtime support needed to run Objective-C programs is now distributed with
GCC (this does not include any Objective-C classes aside from
<code>object</code>).  As much as possible, G<tt>++</tt> is kept compatible with the
evolving draft ANSI standard, but not with <code>cfront</code> (AT&#38;T's compiler),
which has been diverging from ANSI.

The GNU C Compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs
automatic register allocation, common sub-expression elimination, invariant
code motion from loops, induction variable optimizations, constant
propagation and copy propagation, delayed popping of function call
arguments, tail recursion elimination, integration of inline functions and
frame pointer elimination, instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling
of delay slots, leaf function optimization, optimized multiplication by
constants, a certain amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE)
between basic blocks (though not all of the supported machine descriptions
provide for scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes
to instructions, and many local optimizations that are automatically
deduced from the machine description.  Function-wide CSE has been written,
but needs to be cleaned up before it can be installed.
Position-independent code is supported on the 68k, i386, Hitachi Slt,
Hitachi H8/300, Clipper, 88k, SPARC &#38; SPARClite.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <code>long long
int</code>).  It supports extended floating point (type <code>long double</code>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.

GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C and GNU C extensions.  GNU C has
been extended to support nested functions, nonlocal gotos, and taking the
address of a label.

GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs &#38; DWARF.

GCC generates code for many CPUs, including: a29k, Alpha, ARM, Convex cN,
Clipper, Elxsi, H8300, HP--PA (1.0 and 1.1) i370, i386, i486, i860, i960,
m68k, m68020, m88k, MIPS, ns32k, Pyramid, ROMP, RS6000, SH, SPARC,
SPARClite, VAX, and we32k.

Operating systems supported include: AIX, ACIS, AOS, BSD, Clix, Ctix,
DG/UX, Dynix, Genix, HP-UX, ISC, Irix, Linux, Luna, LynxOS, Mach, Minix,
NewsOS, OSF, OSF-Rose, RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2, SunOS 4, SysV, Ultrix, Unos,
&#38; VMS.

The old (version 1) machine descriptions for the Alliant, Tahoe and Spur
(as well as a new port for the Tron) do not work, but are still included in
the distribution in case someone wants to work on them.

Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
easy as building a compiler for the same target machine.  Version 2
supports more general calling conventions: it can pass arguments "by
reference" and can preallocate the space for stack arguments.  GCC 2 on
the SPARC uses the SPARC conventions for structure arguments and return
values.

We no longer distribute or maintain version 1 of GCC, G<tt>++</tt>, or
libg<tt>++</tt>.

Texinfo source for the GCC manual, <cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite>,
is included with the compiler.

See section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for later releases of GCC.

</li><li><b>GDB</b>         (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

In GDB, object files and symbol tables are now read via the BFD library,
which allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs of multiple object file
formats such as a.out and COFF.  Other new features include command
language improvements, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and
watchpoints (breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression
changes).  Exception handling, SunOS shared libraries and C<tt>++</tt> multiple
inheritance are only supported when used with GCC version 2.

GDB comes with a command line user interface; GNU Emacs is distributed with
a GDB mode, and <code>xxgdb</code> provides an X interface (but it is not
distributed or maintained by the FSF; it is available for anonymous FTP
from <code>ftp.x.org</code> in the <tt>`/contrib'</tt> directory).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
has simulators for the Zilog Z8001/2, Hitachi H8/300, H8/500 &#38; Super-H.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <em>targets</em> a platform
means that it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that
GDB can <em>host</em> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but
cannot necessarily debug native programs.  GDB can:


<ul>

<li><em>target</em> &#38; <em>host</em>: DEC Alpha (OSF/1), Amiga 3000 (Amix),

DECstation 3100 &#38; 5000 (Ultrix), HP 9000/300 (BSD), IBM RS/6000 (AIX), i386
(BSD, SCO, Linux, LynxOS), Motorola Delta m88k (System V), NCR 3000 (SVR4),
SGI Iris (MIPS running Irix V3 &#38; V4), SONY News (NewsOS 3.x), Sun-3 &#38; SPARC
(SunOS 4.1, Solaris 2.0) &#38; Ultracomputer (29K running Sym1).

</li><li><em>target</em>, but not <em>host</em>: i960 Nindy, AMD

29000 (COFF &#38; a.out), Fujitsu SPARClite, Hitachi H8/300, m68k &#38; m68332.

</li><li><em>host</em>, but not <em>target</em>: Intel 386 (Mach), IBM

RT/PC (AIX) &#38; HP/Apollo 68k (BSD).

</li></ul>

GDB can use the symbol tables emitted by the compilers supplied by most
vendors of MIPS-based machines, including DEC.  (These tables are in a
format which almost nobody else uses.)  Texinfo source for the manual
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> and a reference card are included.
See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><code>gdbm</code>         (LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

The <code>gdbm</code> library is the GNU replacement for the traditional
<code>dbm</code> and <code>ndbm</code> libraries.  It implements a database using quick
lookup by hashing.  <code>gdbm</code> does not need sparse file formats
(unlike its Unix counterparts).

</li><li><b>Ghostscript</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Ghostscript is GNU's graphics language which is almost fully compatible
with Postscript (see section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>).

The current version of Ghostscript is 2.6.1.  Features include the ability
to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript runs (MIT X
Window System and Microsoft Windows), resulting in much better-looking
screen displays; improved text file printing (like <code>enscript</code>); a
utility to extract the text from a Postscript document; a much more
reliable (and faster) Microsoft Windows implementation; support for
Microsoft C/C<tt>++</tt> 7.0; drivers for many new printers, including the
SPARCprinter, and for TIFF/F (fax) file format; many more Postscript Level
2 facilities, including most of the color space facilities (but not
patterns), and the ability to switch between Level 1 and Level 2
dynamically.

Ghostscript accepts commands in Postscript and executes them by writing
directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to a file that
you can print later (or to a bitmap file that you can manipulate with other
graphics programs).

Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA, or SuperVGA graphics (but please do
<em>not</em> ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use PCs).

See section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for later releases of Ghostscript.

</li><li><b>Ghostview</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Tim Theisen, <code>ghostview@cs.wisc.edu</code>, has created Ghostview, a
previewer for multi-page files that runs on top of Ghostscript.  Ghostview
provides an X11 user interface for the Ghostscript interpreter.  Ghostview
and Ghostscript function as two cooperating programs; Ghostview creates a
viewing window and Ghostscript draws in it.  There is a port for Ghostview
to MS-Windows called "GSview for Windows".  For information about future
releases of this program, see section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>.

</li><li><code>gmp</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

GNU mp is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic on signed integers

</li><li><b>GNATS</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNATS (<b>GN</b>ats: <b>A</b> <b>T</b>racking <b>S</b>ystem, not to be confused with
GNAT, The GNU Ada Translator) is a bug-tracking system.  It is based upon
the paradigm of a central site or organization which receives problem
reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic mail.  Although it has
been used primarily as a software bug-tracking system so far, it is
sufficiently generalized so that it could be used for handling system
administration issues, project management or any number of other
applications.

</li><li><code>gnuplot</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>gnuplot</code> is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
expressions and data.  It handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces
(3 dimensions).  Curiously, the program was neither written nor named for
the GNU Project; the name is a coincidence.

</li><li><b>GnuGo</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GnuGo plays the game of Go (Wei-Chi); it is not yet very sophisticated.

</li><li><code>gperf</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>gperf</code> is a "perfect" hash-table generation utility.  There are
actually two implementations of <code>gperf</code>, one written in C and one in
C<tt>++</tt>.  Both will produce hash functions in either C or C<tt>++</tt>.

</li><li><b>GNU Graphics</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Graphics is a set of programs which produce plots from ASCII or binary
data.  It supports output to Tektronix 4010, Postscript &#38; the MIT X Window
System or compatible devices.  Features include support for output in ln03
and TekniCAD TDA file formats; a replacement for the <code>spline</code> program;
examples of shell scripts using <code>graph</code> and <code>plot</code>; &#38; a
statistics toolkit.

Existing ports need retesting.  Contact Rich Murphey,
<code>Rich@rice.edu</code>, if you can help test/port it to anything beyond
a SPARCstation.

</li><li>

<b>grep</b>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

They are much faster than the traditional Unix versions.

</li><li><b>Groff</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Groff is a document formatting system, which includes
drivers for Postscript, TeX <code>dvi</code> format, and typewriter-like
devices, as well as implementations of
<code>eqn</code>,
<code>nroff</code>,
<code>pic</code>,
<code>refer</code>,
<code>tbl</code>,
<code>troff</code>,
and the
<code>man</code>,
<code>ms</code>,
and
<code>mm</code> macros.
Groff's <code>mm</code> macro package is almost
compatible with the DWB <code>mm</code> macros and has several extensions.
Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley <code>me</code> macros and an
enhanced version of the X11 <code>xditview</code> previewer.
Written in C<tt>++</tt>, these programs can be compiled with GNU
C<tt>++</tt> Version 2.5 or later.

Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed
are complete Texinfo documentation, a <code>grap</code> emulation (a <code>pic</code>
preprocessor for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar
to <code>pm</code> (see <cite>Computing Systems</cite>, Vol. 2, No. 2; ask
<code>office@usenix.org</code> for information on obtaining a copy) and an ASCII
output class for <code>pic</code> so that <code>pic</code> can be integrated with
Texinfo.  Questions and bug reports from users who have read the
documentation that is provided with the distribution can be sent to
<code>bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><code>gzip</code>         (DjgppD, EmcsT, LangT, SrcCD, UtilT)

Some of the contents of our tape and FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our tapes and FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <code>compress</code>, we have switched to another
compression program, <code>gzip</code>.  <code>gzip</code> can expand LZW-compressed
files but uses a different algorithm for compression which generally
produces better results.  It also uncompresses files compressed with System
V's <code>pack</code> program.

</li><li><code>hello</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU <code>hello</code> program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the GNU
General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

Like any truly useful program, <code>hello</code> provides a built-in mail
reader.

</li><li><code>hp2xx</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>hp2xx</code> reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and raster
output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently supported vector
formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex RGIP, Metafont and various
special TeX-related formats, and simplified HP-GL (line drawing only)
for imports.  Raster formats supported include IMG, PBM, PCX, &#38; HP-PCL
(including Deskjet &#38; DJ5xxC support).  Previewers work under X11 (Unix),
OS/2 (PM &#38; full screen), MS-DOS (SVGA, VGA, &#38; HGC).

</li><li><code>indent</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>indent</code> is a revision of the BSD version.  By default, it formats
C source according to the GNU coding standards.  The BSD default, K&#38;R and
other formats are available as options.  It is also possible to define your
own format.
GNU <code>indent</code> is more robust and provides more functionality than other
versions, e.g., it handles C<tt>++</tt> comments.

</li><li><b>Ispell</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Ispell is an interactive spell checker that suggests "near misses" as
replacements for unrecognized words.  System and user-maintained
dictionaries can be used.  Standalone and GNU Emacs interfaces are
available.

</li><li><b>JACAL</b>         <em>Not available from the FSF</em>

JACAL is a symbolic mathematics system for the manipulation and
simplification of equations and single and multiple-valued algebraic
expressions constructed of numbers, variables, radicals, and algebraic
functions, differential operators and holonomic functions.  In addition,
vectors, matrices, and tensors of the above objects are included.

JACAL was written in Scheme by Aubrey Jaffer.  It comes with SCM, an IEEE
P1178 and R4RS compliant version of Scheme written in C.  SCM runs on
Amiga, Atari-ST, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix, and similar
systems.  SLIB is a portable Scheme library used by JACAL.  Get JACAL,
SLIB and SCM sources via anonymous FTP from either

</li><li><code>m4</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>m4</code> is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.
It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (for example,
handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).  <code>m4</code> also has
built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
arithmetic, etc.

</li><li><code>make</code>         (BinCD, EmcsT, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>make</code> supports POSIX 1003.2 and has all but a few obscure
features of the BSD and System V versions of <code>make</code>, as well as many
of our own extensions.  GNU extensions include long options, parallel
compilation, flexible implicit pattern rules, conditional execution and
powerful text manipulation functions.  Recent versions have improved error
reporting and added support for the popular <samp>`+='</samp> syntax to append
more text to a variable's definition.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Make
Manual</cite> comes with the program.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

GNU <code>make</code> is on several of our tapes because some system vendors
supply no <code>make</code> utility at all, and some native <code>make</code> programs
lack the <code>VPATH</code> feature essential for using the GNU configure system
to its full extent.  The GNU <code>make</code> sources have a shell script to
build <code>make</code> itself on such systems.

write and manipulate files on an MS-DOS file system (usually a diskette).

</li><li><b>MULE</b>         (SrcCD)

MULE is a MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs 18.  It can handle many
character sets at once including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese,
Thai, Greek, the ISO Latin-1 through Latin-5 character sets, Ukrainian,
Russian, and other Cyrillic alphabets.  A text buffer in MULE can contain a
mixture of characters from these languages.  To input any of these
characters, you can use various input methods provided by MULE itself.  In
addition, if you use MULE under some terminal emulators (kterm, cxterm, or
exterm), you can use its input methods.
See section <a href="#SEC12">GNU and Other Free Software in Japan</a>, for more information about MULE.

Institutes of Health (NIH), using the C<tt>++</tt> programming language.

</li><li><code>nvi</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>nvi</code> is a free implementation of the <code>vi</code>/<code>ex</code> Unix editor.
It has most of the functionality of the original <code>vi</code>/<code>ex</code>,
except "open" mode &#38; the <code>lisp</code> option, which will be added.
Enhancements over <code>vi</code>/<code>ex</code> include split screens with multiple
buffers, ability to handle 8-bit data, infinite file &#38; line lengths, tag
stacks, infinite undo &#38; extended regular expressions.  It runs under BSD,
Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, BSDI, AIX, HP-UX, DGUX, IRIX, PSF, PTX, Solaris,
SunOS, Ultrix, Unixware &#38; should port easily to many other systems.

</li><li><b>Octave</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

Octave is a high-level language that is primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

Octave does arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices, solve
sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions over finite and
infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary differential and
differential-algebraic equations.  Send queries and bug reports to:
<code>bug-octave@che.utexas.edu</code>.

Octave is available via anonymous ftp from <code>ftp.che.utexas.edu</code> in
the directory <tt>`/pub/octave'</tt>.  The files are in gzipped <code>tar</code>

Object System.  It runs under CLISP, mentioned above.

</li><li><code>perl</code>         (LangT, SrcCD)

Larry Wall's <code>perl</code> combines the features and capabilities of
<code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sh</code> and C, as well as interfaces to all the
system calls and many C library routines.  A perl mode for editing
<code>perl</code> code comes with GNU Emacs 19.

</li><li><code>ptx</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

GNU <code>ptx</code> is the GNU version of the traditional permuted index
generator.  It can handle multiple input files at once, produce TeX
compatible output, and produce readable <em>KWIC</em> (KeyWords In Context)
indexes without needing to use <code>nroff</code>.  This version does not handle
input files that do not fit in memory all at once.

</li><li><code>rc</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>rc</code> is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than
<code>csh</code>) and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.
It's intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
scripts.  It inspired the shell <code>es</code>.

</li><li><b>RCS</b>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

The Revision Control System, RCS, is used for version control and
management of software projects.  When used with GNU <code>diff</code>, RCS can
handle binary files (executables, object files, 8-bit data, etc).
Also see the item about CVS in this article.

</li><li><code>recode</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>recode</code> converts files between character sets and usages.
When exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the
offending characters or fall back on approximations.  This program
recognizes or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to
transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character
sets are supported.

</li><li><b>regex</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
internationalization features.  In the past, it has been included in many
GNU programs which use regex routines.  Now it is finally available
separately.  A faster version of this library comes with <code>sed</code>.

</li><li><b>Scheme</b>         (SchmT)

For information about Scheme, see section <a href="#SEC24">Scheme Tape</a>.

</li><li><code>screen</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>screen</code> is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate
"screens" (ttys) on a single physical character-based terminal.  Each
virtual terminal emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022
functions.  <code>screen</code> sessions can be detached and resumed later on a
different terminal type.

</li><li><code>sed</code>         (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>sed</code> is a stream-oriented version of <code>ed</code>.  It is used copiously
in shell scripts.  GNU <code>sed</code> comes with the rx library,
which is a faster version of regex (see section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>).

</li><li><b>Shellutils</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Use shellutils interactively or in shell scripts:
<code>basename</code>,
<code>date</code>,
<code>dirname</code>,
<code>echo</code>,
<code>env</code>,
<code>expr</code>,
<code>false</code>,
<code>groups</code>,
<code>id</code>,
<code>nice</code>,
<code>nohup</code>,
<code>printenv</code>,
<code>printf</code>,
<code>sleep</code>,
<code>stty</code>,
<code>su</code>,
<code>tee</code>,
<code>test</code>,
<code>true</code>,
<code>tty</code>,
<code>uname</code>,
<code>who</code>,
<code>whoami</code>,
and
<code>yes</code>.

</li><li><b>GNU Shogi</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
captured pieces can be returned into play.

GNU Shogi has been created by modifying GNU Chess; GNU Shogi implements the
same features as GNU Chess and uses similar heuristics.  As a new feature,
sequences of partial board patterns can be introduced in order to help the
program play a good order of moves towards specific opening patterns.
There are both character and X display interfaces.

GNU Shogi is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

</li><li><b>Smalltalk</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language system
written in highly portable C.  It has been successfully ported to many Unix
and some other platforms, including DOS (but these non-Unix ports are not
available from the FSF).  Current features include a binary image save
capability, the ability to invoke user-written C code and pass parameters
to it, a GNU Emacs editing mode, a version of the X protocol invocable from
Smalltalk, optional byte-code compilation tracing and byte-code execution
tracing, and automatically loaded per-user initialization files.  It
implements all of the classes and protocol in the Smalltalk-80 book
"Smalltalk-80: The Language", except for the graphic user
interface (`GUI') related classes.

See section <a href="#SEC15">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans for later releases of Smalltalk.

</li><li><b>Superopt</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for a
given function.  You provide the GNU superoptimizer, <code>gso</code>, a
function, a CPU to generate code for, and how many instructions you can
accept.  Its application in GCC is described in the <cite>ACM SIGPLAN
PLDI'92</cite> proceedings.  Superopt supports: SPARC, m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM
RS/6000, AMD 29000, Intel 80x86, Pyramid, DEC Alpha, &#38; HP--PA.

</li><li><code>tar</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>tar</code> includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
special features that allow <code>tar</code> to be used for incremental and full
backups.  Unfortunately, GNU <code>tar</code> implements an early draft of the
POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite> standard which is different from the final
standard.  Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible
fashion is not trivial.

</li><li><b>Termcap Library</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for <tt>`libtermcap.a'</tt> on
any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap
entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is source for the
<cite>Termcap Manual</cite> in Texinfo format.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>TeX</b>         (SrcCD)

TeX is a document formatting system that handles complicated
typesetting, including mathematics.  It is GNU's standard text formatter.

You can obtain TeX from the University of Washington, which maintains and
supports a tape distribution of TeX for Unix systems.  The core material
consists of Karl Berry's <code>web2c</code> TeX package, the sources for which
are available via anonymous ftp; retrieval instructions are in
<tt>`pub/tex/FTP.nwc'</tt> on <code>ftp.cs.umb.edu</code>.  If you receive any
installation support from the University of Washington, please consider
sending them a donation.

To order a full distribution written in <code>tar</code> on either a
1/4inch 4-track QIC-24 cartridge or a 4mm DAT cartridge, send
$210.00 to:

   USA

   Electronic-Mail: <code>unixtex@u.washington.edu</code>
   Telephone: <tt>+</tt>1-206-543-6259
</pre>

Please make checks payable to the University of Washington.
Checks must be in U.S. dollars, drawn on a U.S. bank.
Prepaid orders are preferred but purchase orders are acceptable; however,
they carry an extra charge of $10.00 to pay for invoice processing.
Overseas sites: please add to the base cost $20.00 for shipment via
air parcel post, or $30.00 for shipment via courier.
Please check with the above for current prices and formats.

</li><li><b>Texinfo</b>         (EmcsT, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

Texinfo is a set of utilities which generate both printed manuals and
online hypertext-style documentation (called "Info").  There are also
programs for reading online Info documents.  Version 3 has both GNU Emacs
Lisp and standalone programs written in C or shell script.  Texinfo mode
for GNU Emacs enables easy editing and updating of Texinfo files.
Programs provided include
<code>makeinfo</code>,
<code>info</code>,
<code>texi2dvi</code>,
<code>texindex</code>,
<code>tex2patch</code>,
and
<code>fixfonts</code>.
Source for the <cite>Texinfo Manual</cite> is included.  See section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>Textutils</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

The Textutils programs manipulate textual data.  They include:
<code>cat</code>,
<code>cksum</code>,
<code>comm</code>,
<code>csplit</code>,
<code>cut</code>,
<code>expand</code>,
<code>fold</code>,
<code>head</code>,
<code>join</code>,
<code>nl</code>,
<code>od</code>,
<code>paste</code>,
<code>pr</code>,
<code>sort</code>,
<code>split</code>,
<code>sum</code>,
<code>tac</code>,
<code>tail</code>,
<code>tr</code>,
<code>unexpand</code>,
<code>uniq</code>,
and
<code>wc</code>.

</li><li><b>Tile Forth</b>         (LangT, SrcCD)

Tile Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth--83 standard written in
C, allowing it to be easily moved between different computers.
(Traditionally, Forth implementations are written in assembler to use
the underlying hardware as optimally as possible, but this also makes
them less portable.)

</li><li><code>time</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>time</code> is used to report statistics (usually from a shell) about the
amount of user, system and real time used by a process.  On some
systems it also reports memory usage, page faults, and other statistics.

</li><li><code>tput</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>tput</code> is a portable way for shell scripts to use special terminal
capabilities.  Our <code>tput</code> uses the Termcap database, instead of
Terminfo as most others do.

</li><li><b>UUCP</b>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

This version of UUCP was written by Ian Lance Taylor, and is GNU's standard
UUCP system.  It supports the <code>f</code>,
<code>g</code> and <code>v</code> (in all window and packet sizes),
<code>G</code>,
<code>t</code>,
<code>e</code>,
Zmodem and two new bidirectional
(<code>i</code> and <code>j</code>) protocols.  If you have a
Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  If you have TLI
libraries, it can make TLI connections.  Source is included for a Texinfo
manual, which is not yet published by the FSF.

</li><li>

<code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code> are used to transmit binary files over
transmission mediums that support only simple ASCII data.

</li><li><code>wdiff</code>         (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>wdiff</code> is a front-end to GNU <code>diff</code>.  It compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to
create the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
terminals and pagers.  <code>wdiff</code> is particularly useful when two texts
differ only by a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.

<h4 id="SEC23">Emacs Tape</h4>

<p>
This tape has Common Lisp systems and libraries, GNU Emacs, assorted
extensions that work with GNU Emacs, and a few other important utilities.

</p>

<ul>
<li>Calc 2.02c

</li><li>CLISP 1994.01.08

</li><li>GNU Common Lisp 1.0

</li><li>elib 0.06

</li><li>Make 3.71

</li><li>PCL 1993.03.18

</li><li>Texinfo 3.1

</li></ul>


<h4 id="SEC24">Scheme Tape</h4>

<p>
Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed
at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming, and
to research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

</p>
<p>
This tape contains MIT Scheme 7.1, which conforms to the
"Revised^4 Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
(MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source is included.
It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries that can be used to bootstrap Scheme are available for:

</p>

<ul>
<li>HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700 &#38; 800 running HP-UX 7.0 or 8.0

</li><li>NeXT running NeXT OS 1.0 or 2.0

</li><li>Sun-3 or Sun-4 running SunOS 4.1

</li><li>DECstation 3100/5100 running Ultrix 4.0

</li><li>Sony NeWS-3250 running NEWS OS 5.01

</li><li>Vax running 4.3BSD

</li></ul>

<p>
If your system is not on this list and you don't enjoy the bootstrap
challenge, see the JACAL item in section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC25">X11 Tapes</h4>

<p>
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 6 of the MIT X Window System.
The first tape contains all of the core software, documentation and
some contributed clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is
necessary for running X or running GNU Emacs under X.  The second,
"optional" tape contains contributed libraries and other toolkits, the
Andrew User Interface System, games, and other programs.

</p>
<p>
The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released for programs on
both tapes.  See section <a href="#SEC38">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</a>.

</p>
<p>
We will distribute X11R5 on tape until X11R6 is stable, and on the
section <a href="#SEC31">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, while supplies last.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC26">Berkeley 4.4BSD--Lite Tape</h4>

<p>
The "4.4BSD--Lite" release is the last from the Computer Systems
Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley.  It includes
most of the BSD software system except for a few proprietary files that
still remain in the full 4.4BSD distribution.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC27">VMS Emacs and VMS Compiler Tapes</h4>

<p>
We offer two VMS tapes.  One has just GNU Emacs 18.59 (none of the
other software on the section <a href="#SEC23">Emacs Tape</a>, is included).  The other has
GCC 2.3.3, Bison 1.19 (to compile GCC), GAS 1.38 (to assemble GCC's output) and
some library and include files (none of the other software on the
section <a href="#SEC21">Languages Tape</a>, is included).  We are not aware of a GDB port for
VMS.  Both VMS tapes have executables from which you can bootstrap, as the
DEC VMS C compiler cannot compile GCC.  Please do not ask us to devote
effort to VMS support, because it is peripheral to the GNU Project.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC28">CD-ROMs</h3>

<p>
We currently offer these CD-ROMs:

</p>

<ul>

<li>May 1994 section <a href="#SEC30">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC31">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC32">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</li></ul>

<p>
Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format and can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most operating systems.  If your driver supports it you can mount
each CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions and it will look just like an
ordinary Unix file system, rather than one full of truncated and otherwise
mangled names that fit the vanilla ISO 9660 specifications.

</p>
<p>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC29">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the May 1994 Source CD
costs $400.  It costs $100 if you, an individual, are paying out of your
own pocket.  The Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs $240 for a business
or organization, and $60 for an individual.

</p>


<ul>

<li><b>What do the individual and company prices mean?</b>

The software on our disk is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the May 1994 Source CD-ROM, we charge $400.
When an individual buys the same disk, we charge just $100.

This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish, and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.

You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

Buying CDs at the company price is especially helpful for Project GNU; just
80 May 1994 Source CDs at that price supports an FSF programmer or tech
writer for a year.

</li><li><b>Why is there an individual price?</b>

In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $400 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly, and decrease the software development we can do.

However, for individuals, $400 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the
lower price of $100, but not do the same for companies.

</li><li><b>Is there a maximum price?</b>

Our stated prices are minimums.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept
as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt
public charity.

</li></ul>


<h4 id="SEC30">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
The CD-ROM also contains Texinfo source for the <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite> Edition 2.3 for version 19, and other manuals listed in
section <a href="#SEC17">GNU Documentation</a>; as well as a snapshot of the Emacs Lisp Archive at
Ohio State University.  (You can get the libraries in this archive by
anonymous FTP from <code>archive.cis.ohio-state.edu</code> in
<tt>`/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive'</tt>.)

</p>
<p>
The contents of the MIT Scheme, X11 Optional and VMS tapes are not
included.  Programs that are only on MS-DOS diskettes and not on the tapes
are also not included.  See section <a href="#SEC20">Tapes</a>, and section <a href="#SEC33">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</p>
<p>
Except for
the Ghostview for Windows
executable, there are no precompiled programs on this CD.  You will need a
C compiler.  (Programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program.)

</p>

<h4 id="SEC31">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is still distributing the third edition of its
Source Code CD-ROM.  We are doing so because it contains X11R5, and we feel
that people should have a choice between X11R5 and X11R6 until the latter
is stable.  Because the other software on the third edition is older than
that on the fourth edition, we have reduced the price of the third edition.
The third edition contains the following packages:

</p>

<ul>
<li>acm 3.1

</li><li>Autoconf 1.7

</li><li>BASH 1.13.4

are also not included.  See section <a href="#SEC20">Tapes</a>, and section <a href="#SEC33">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</p>

<p>
Except for the MIT Scheme binaries for MS-DOS and the Ghostview for Windows
executable, there are no precompiled programs on this CD.  You will need a
C compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).

</p>

<h4 id="SEC32">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We are now offering a CD-ROM that contains executables for GNU compiler
tools for some systems which lack a compiler.  This helps people with 80386
and 80486 machines running MS-D0S, not to mention HP--PA machines
running HP-UX 9, and Sparcs running SunOS 4.1 &#38; Solaris 2.

</p>
<p>
This enables the people who use these systems
to compile GNU and other free software without having to buy
a proprietary compiler.

</p>
<p>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD-ROM.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
<b>These packages</b>:

</p>

<ul>
<li>DJGPP 1.11.m1

</li><li>GCC/G<tt>++</tt>/Objective-C 2.5.7

<h3 id="SEC33">MS-DOS Diskettes</h3>

<p>
The FSF distributes, on 3.5inch 1.44MB diskettes, some of the GNU
software ported to MS-DOS.  The disks have both sources and executables.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC34">DJGPP Diskettes</h4>

<p>
We offer DJGPP on 21 diskettes.  For details, see section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC35">Emacs Diskettes</h4>

<p>
Demacs is a version of GNU Emacs.  Two versions are included on the six
diskettes we distribute: one handles 8-bit character sets; the other, based
on an early version of MULE, handles 16-bit character sets including
Kanji.

</p>
<p>
We will be replacing Demacs with the MS-DOS port of GNU Emacs 19, as soon
as the port is ready.  The number of diskettes is not yet known.  See section <a href="#SEC18">GNU Software</a>, for details about both programs.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC36">Selected Utilities Diskettes</h4>

<p>
The GNUish MS-DOS Project releases GNU software ported to PC compatibles.
We offer these programs on five diskettes.  In general, this software
will run on 8086 and 80286--based machines; an 80386 is not required.  Some
of these utilities are necessarily missing features.
Included are:
<code>cpio</code>,
<code>diff</code>,
<code>find</code>,
<code>flex</code>,
<code>gdbm</code>,
<code>grep</code>,
<code>indent</code>,
<code>less</code>,
<code>m4</code>,
<code>make</code>,
<code>ptx</code>,
RCS,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>shar</code>,
<code>sort</code>,
&#38;
Texinfo.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC37">Windows Diskette</h4>

<p>
We offer GNU Chess and <code>gnuplot</code> for Microsoft Windows on a single
diskette.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC38">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</h3>

<p>
If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest FSF developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent
to three tapes or CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you
four new versions of the tape of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.
The tapes are sent each quarter, the CD-ROMs are sent as they
are issued (which is currently twice a year, but we may issue it more
frequently in the future.)

</p>
<p>
Regularly, we will send you a new version of an
Emacs, Languages, Utilities, or MIT X Window System (X11R6) Required tape
or the
Source CD-ROM.  The MIT Scheme and MIT X Window System Optional
tapes are not changed often enough to warrant quarterly updates.  We do not
yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools
Binaries CD-ROM.

</p>
<p>
Since Emacs 19 is on the Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a subscription
to either is an easy way to keep current with Emacs 19 as it evolves.

</p>
<p>
A subscription is also an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to
the MIT X Window System.  We will update the X11R6 Required tape as fixes and
patches are issued throughout the year.  Each new edition of the
section <a href="#SEC30">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, also has updated sources for the MIT X Window System.

<h3 id="SEC39">The Deluxe Distribution</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation has been repeatedly asked to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source code, the
Deluxe Distribution includes a complete set of our printed manuals and
reference cards.

</p>
<p>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete MIT X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</p>

<p>
You may choose one of these machines and operating systems: HP 9000 series
300, 700 or 800 (4.3BSD or HP-UX); RS/6000 (AIX); SONY News 68k (4.3BSD or
NewsOS 4); Sun-3, Sun-4, or SPARC (SunOS 4 or Solaris).  If your machine or
system is not listed, or if a specific program has not been ported to that
machine, please call the FSF office at the phone number below or send
e-mail to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code> to see what we can do.

</p>
<p>
We supply the software on one of these tape formats in Unix <code>tar</code>
format: 1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel; Sun DC300XLP 1/4in
cartridge, QIC-24; Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridge;

<h3 id="SEC40">How to Get GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All the software and publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  The easiest way to
get GNU software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can get GNU software direct from the FSF by ordering diskettes, tapes,
or CD-ROMs.  Such orders provide most of the funds for the FSF staff to
develop more free software, so please support our work by ordering if you
can.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC48">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software; they do not
work with us, but can provide our software in other forms.  Some are listed
in section <a href="#SEC42">Free Software for Microcomputers</a>.  Please note that the Free
Software Foundation is <em>not</em> affiliated with them in any way and is
<em>not</em> responsible for either the currency of their versions or the
swiftness of their responses.

</p>
<p>
If you decide to do business with one of these distributors, ask them how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development projects or by writing free software
themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can help encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

</p>
<p>
Our main FTP host is very busy and only allows a limited number of FTP
logins.  Please use one of these other TCP/IP Internet sites that also
provide GNU software via anonymous FTP (program: <code>ftp</code>, user:
<code>anonymous</code>, password: <var>your e-mail address</var>, mode:
<code>binary</code>).  If you have FTP access but can't reach one of the
hosts listed below, you can get the software via FTP using the same
protocol from GNU's main FTP host, <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code> (IP address is
<code>18.71.0.38</code>).  For more details, get the file

</li><li><b>Moldy, a Molecular Dynamics Simulation Program</b>

Moldy is a molecular dynamics simulation program written by Keith
Refson.  He says, "... I have a slightly unusual rationale for
using the GPL ..."


<blockquote>
<p>
For the last few hundred years or so there has been a principle which
forms part of the ethos of scientific endeavour.  It is that the fruits
of one's research should be openly published so that others may learn,
use and build upon them.  Results may be independently checked by other
researchers, contributing to the reliability which distinguishes
science from other forms of knowledge.  And the benefits are available
to the general good.  Of course such a high ethical principle is not
always honoured,  scientists being human and subject to the usual
commercial pressures.  But it remains as an ideal to strive for.

</p>
<p>
I have placed my molecular dynamics simulation program, called Moldy,
under the GPL because I find the copyleft conditions in close agreement
with this spirit of scientific freedom and cooperation.  It is a
research tool for performing atomistic computer simulations of solids
and liquids, and therefore not of widespread use outside the
discipline.  I wish to make it available to any scientist who wishes to
use it, to encourage them to add to the program and to ensure that any
improvements are as free as the original code.
</p></blockquote>

Moldy comes with a manual in LaTeX or PostScript format; it runs on Unix,
VMS and MS-DOS systems.  FTP the sources from <code>earth.ox.ac.uk</code>.

</li><li><b>Map: the Interactive Network Map</b>

Map, the Interactive Network Map is a part of a network management

</li><li><b>SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor</b>

SIPP is a library for creating photorealistic renderings of 3D scenes.  A
scene is built up of objects which can be transformed with rotation,
translation and scaling.  The objects form hierarchies where each object
can have arbitrarily many subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a
number of connected polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud
or flat shading.  The library supports texture mapping with textures in up
to 3 dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates.  A scene
can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources.  The lights
from some of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.
You can FTP it from <code>isy.liu.se</code> (130.236.1.3) in file

<b>GNU Software</b> <em>not</em> <b>on Apple computers</b>

In lawsuits (currently being appealed), Apple claims the power to stop
people from writing any program that has a user interface that works even
vaguely like the Macintosh's.  If Apple wins in the courts, it will create
for itself a new power over the public that will enable it to put an end to
free software.  So long as Apple is committed to establishing this kind of
monopoly, we will not provide any support or software for Apple machines.
We ask that you too refrain from developing for or porting to Apple
systems, since any more software adds to their business.  Don't feed the

(especially for systems that don't come with a C compiler).
Please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li>

Oleo extensions and other free software for business, such as accounting
and project management programs.

</li><li>

600<tt>+</tt> megabyte SCSI disks to give us more space to develop software.

</li><li>

386 or 486 PC compatibles with 200<tt>+</tt> MB of disk and Ethernet cards.

</li><li>

A Sun SPARCstation and a Sun-3/60 or 4/110.

</li><li>

SCSI tape drives for 4mm DAT tapes, 8mm Exabyte tape drives,
and 1600 or 6250bpi 1/2inch reel to reel tapes.

</li><li>

Companies to lend us capable programmers and technical writers for at
least six months.  True wizards may be welcome for shorter periods, but
we have found that six months is the minimum time for a good programmer
to finish a worthwhile project.

</li><li>

Professors who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting research
assistants to do GNU development, with FSF support.

</li><li>

Speech and character recognition software and systems (if the devices
aren't too weird), with the device drivers if possible.  This would help
the productivity of partially disabled people (including a few we know).

</li><li>

New quotes and ideas for articles in the GNU's Bulletin.  We particularly
like to highlight organizations involved with free information exchanges,
software that uses the GNU General Public License, and companies providing
free software support as a primary business.

</li><li>

If you use and appreciate our software, please send a contribution.  One
way to help us defray our costs is to order a distribution tape, diskette,
or CD-ROM.  A way to increase your contribution is to order a
section <a href="#SEC39">The Deluxe Distribution</a>.  This is especially helpful if you work for a
business where the word "donation" is anathema.  Because of the value
received, the full dollar amount of such donations are not tax deductible
as charitable contributions; however, they may qualify as a business
expense.

     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
