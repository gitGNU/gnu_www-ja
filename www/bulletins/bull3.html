  Who</a></h1>

  <p>The usual people are still working on GNU: <b>Richard
  Stallman</b> recently returned from Korea, where he worked at
  KAIST during the month of April. He also visited DECUS in Tokyo
  and spoke there. He is currently continuing to develop the GNU C
  compiler. Hackers <b>Len Tower</b>, <b>Richard Mlynarik</b>, and
  <b>Paul Rubin</b> are doing various pieces of volunteer work as
  their time permits it, and <b>Jay Fenlason</b> continues to work
  full time on the GNU assembler and libraries. At the distribution
  end, FSF treasurer <b>Bob Chassell</b> has just finished
  coordinating production of another run of GNU Emacs manuals.
  <b>Jerry Puzo</b> has been making sure that our correspondence
  with the outside world is handled smoothly.</p>

  <p>Some new people have also joined us: <b>Mark D'Agostino</b> is
  now taking care of the FSF mail room, filling the tape and manual
  orders which are coming in at an ever increasing rate. Mark is an
  MIT student in Physics and Electrical Engineering. <b>Peter
  Deutsch</b>, an old-time hacker from MIT, is in his spare time
  writing a PostScript language interpreter for bitmap screens, for
  use with GNU under the X window system. His interpreter will be
  called "GhostScript" and will hopefully also be able to drive
  printers. Peter is well known for his work on Lisp and Smalltalk,
  and continues to do Smalltalk development as Chief Scientist at
  ParcPlace Systems, a spinoff of Xerox PARC. <b>Velu Sinha</b>
  wrote the GNU shell, which will be released for testing soon.
  <b>Rayan Zachariasen</b>, whose name I hope I have not
  misspelled, is writing a mailer. Finally, <b>Kathy Hargreaves</b>
  and <b>Karl Berry</b> transcribed Richard Stallman's Microwave
  Day lecture on how the GNU C compiler works; we hope to publish
  an edited version of the transcript soon. Kathy and Karl are both
  studying digital typography in the Brown University CS
  department. They plan later to design some type fonts for use
  with GhostScript. They also designed the new FSF order form that
  appears at the end of this bulletin.</p>

  <h1><a name="SEC5" href="bull3.html#TOC5" id="SEC5">What is the
  Free Software Foundation?</a></h1>

  <center>
    by Richard M. Stallman
  </center>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating
  restrictions on copying, redistribution, understanding and
  modification of software.</p>

  <p>The word "free" in our name does not refer to price; it refers
  to freedom. First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute
  it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.
  Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control
  it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must
  be made available to you.</p>

  <p>The Foundation works to give you these freedoms by developing
  free compatible replacements for proprietary software.
  Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated
  software system "GNU" that is upward-compatible with Unix. When
  it is released, everyone will be permitted to copy it and
  distribute it to others; in addition, it will be distributed with
  source code, so you will be able to learn about operating systems
  by reading it, to port it to your own machine, to improve it, and
  to exchange the changes with others.</p>

  <p>There are already organizations that distribute free CPM and
  MSDOS software. The Free Software Foundation is doing something
  different.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The other organizations exist primarily for distribution;
    they distribute whatever happens to be available. We hope to
    provide a complete integrated free system that will eliminate
    the need for any proprietary software.</li>

    <li>One consequence is that we are now interested only in
    software that fits well into the context of the GNU system.
    Distributing free MSDOS or Macintosh software is a useful
    activity, but it is not part of our game plan.</li>

    <li>Another consequence is that we will actively attempt to
    improve and extend the software we distribute, as fast as our
    manpower permits. For this reason, we will always be seeking
    donations of money, computer equipment or time, labor, and
    source code to improve the GNU system.</li>

    <li>In fact, our primary purpose is this software development
    effort; distribution is just an adjunct which also brings in
    some money. We think that the users will do most of the
    distribution on their own, without needing or wanting our
    help.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="SEC6" href="bull3.html#TOC6" id="SEC6">Why a
  Unix-Like System?</a></h3>

  <p>It is necessary to be compatible with some widely used system
  to give our system an immediate base of trained users who could
  switch to it easily and an immediate base of application software
  that can run on it. (Eventually we will provide free replacements
  for proprietary application software as well, but that is some
  years in the future.)</p>

  <p>We chose Unix because it is a fairly clean design which is
  already known to be portable, yet whose popularity is still
  rising. The disadvantages of Unix seem to be things we can fix
  without removing what is good in Unix.</p>

  <p>Why not imitate MSDOS or CP/M? They are more widely used,
  true, but they are also very weak systems, designed for tiny
  machines. Unix is much more powerful and interesting. When a
  system takes years to implement, it is important to write it for
  the machines that will become available in the future; not to let
  it be limited by the capabilities of the machines that are in
  widest use at the moment but will be obsolete when the new system
  is finished.</p>

  <p>Why not aim for a new, more advanced system, such as a Lisp
  Machine? Mainly because that is still more of a research effort;
  there is a sizeable chance that the wrong choices will be made
  and the system will turn out not very good. In addition, such
  systems are often tied to special hardware. Being tied to one
  manufacturer's machine would make it hard to remain independent
  of that manufacturer and get broad community support.</p>

  <h1><a name="SEC7" href="bull3.html#TOC7" id="SEC7">Editorial:
  Oppose Audio Copy Protection</a></h1>

  <p>Just when science is making it possible to copy music
  perfectly, record companies are trying to make it impossible
  again, with government-enforced copy protection.</p>

  <p>The invention of the phonograph created a situation where the
  best way to copy audio signals was by mass production. This
  temporary situation made record companies necessary and useful.
  It also made copyright a fairly harmless way of encouraging
  activities that benefit the public. (That was the original
  purpose of copyright.)</p>

  <p>Digital audio tape machines will change all this. Mass
  produced copies will no longer be better than you can make.
  Record companies may still have customers, but they will be
  partly obsolete.</p>

  <p>But obsolete institutions don't peacefully accept being
  ignored. So there is a bill before Congress to require specific
  copy-protection equipment in every digital audio tape
  machine.</p>

  <p>The proposed technical method involves degrading the quality
  of prerecorded music by eliminating a narrow frequency band. When
  the recorder notices that band is empty, it will shut off. Even
  if the signal comes over the radio, copying it will be
  impossible.</p>

  <p>If this law passes, we can expect more of the same. In the
  past, there were many natural obstacles to copying information,
  and surmounting the obstacles was a business. The overall thrust
  of the information revolution is to remove these obstacles; to
  make information easy to copy and transform. Each time technology
  makes things easier, businesses that depend on obstacles demand a
  man-made obstacle--required by law--to replace the natural
  one.</p>

  <p>A few general-purpose I/O devices can turn your computer into
  a digital audio tape recorder. Will there be a law to make this
  impossible? Perhaps a law that you can't have source to your
  kernel, lest you patch around the government-imposed access
  control?</p>

  <p>To fight this bill, call your Congressman and Senators and
  urge them to vote against it. It is called the Digital Audio Tape
  Recording Act of 1987: S. 506, H.R. 1384.</p>

  <p>You can get the phone numbers by calling information; the
  Senators usually have offices in the state capitol. For more
  information, contact this organization:</p>

  <h1><a name="SEC8" href="bull3.html#TOC8" id="SEC8">Gnus
  Flashes</a></h1>

  <p>This is a collection of news items pertaining to the GNU
  project, the Free Software Foundation, and free software in
  general.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Termcap Manual Being Published</b> Jim Joyce's Unix
    bookstore in San Francisco is probably going to publish the
    Termcap programming manual written by Richard Stallman. This
    manual was written as a spinoff of the Emacs project, since the
    Unix documentation for Termcap does not provide enough
    information. The Foundation will probably offer printed copies
    of this manual for sale after Jim Joyce has gotten them
    printed. Like everything else written at GNU, the manual will
    be free for everyone to copy; however, Jim plans to donate some
    money to RMS for every copy he sells.</li>

    <li><b>GNU Chess Improved</b> Stuart Cracraft reports that as a
    result of his installing new searching and evaluation routines
    in GNU Chess, the latest version recently beat an 1800 rated
    player. He is collecting contributions of book openings,
    endgame databases, and master games, to further improve the
    program. Contact him if you think you can help. His address is
    cracraft@venera.isi.edu.</li>

    <li><b>If You Can't Beat 'em...</b> RMS was recently invited to
    give a talk about GNU at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray
    Hill, New Jersey (the birthplace of Un*x). He reports that the
    talk was generally well received.</li>

    <li><b>X Becoming Accepted</b> The trade press has been
    reporting that the free X window system written at MIT and DEC
    is becoming a multi-vendor industry standard for portable
    window systems. The Foundation distributes X on its standard
    software tape, and GNU Emacs and GNU Chess come with special
    interfaces to X.</li>

    <li><b>TeX in C available from Pat Monardo</b> At long last,
    there is a free implementation of TeX in C. It is a hand
    translation by Pat Monardo of UC Berkeley of the WEB version,
    and it tries to retain the module and variable names of the WEB
    version while remaining a readable C program. Both the
    Foundation and the maintainers of the Unix TeX distribution at
    the University of Washington will offer this version
    eventually. You can also contact Pat Monardo directly for more
    information. His address is ucbvax!monardo (uucp), or
    monardo@ucbvax.berkeley.edu (Internet). Consider sending a
    donation to Pat if you find this program useful.</li>

    <li><b>Victory in SoftKlone trial</b> A Federal Judge has found
    the SoftKlone company not guilty of nearly all counts of
    copyright infringement brought in a look-and-feel suit filed by
    the marketers of Crosstalk (a PC communications program). Even
    though the SoftKlone program is proprietary, the outcome of
    this trial is an important affirmation of everyone's freedom to
    write and distribute whatever programs they want to.</li>

    <li>
      <b>Send In The Clones</b> Meanwhile, the Lotus look-and-feel
      copywrong suit has still not been resolved. In order to help
      the defendants of this suit, Dan Bricklin is compiling a list
      of software and hardware "clones". These are programs and
      machines that duplicate the functionality, features, or "look
      and feel" of previously-released programs. (Dan is the author
      of VisiCalc, of which Lotus 1-2-3 is itself a partial clone).
      The Foundation is asking readers to please think of as many
      <em>detailed</em> examples as they can and mail them
      electronically to:
      <pre>
   send-in-the-clones@prep.ai.mit.edu (Internet),
</pre>or
      <pre>
   mit-eddie!mit-prep!send-in-the-clones (uucp).
</pre>or by snail mail to
      <pre>
Send In The Clones
c/o Free Software Foundation
1000 Mass Ave.
Cambridge, MA  02138
</pre>We will forward all the messages we receive to Dan Bricklin.
Here are some of the examples we already have, to give people an
idea of what we're looking for:

      <ul>
        <li>CPU's made by Amdahl and others that emulate IBM
        mainframes.</li>

        <li>Ashton-Tate "Multiplan", which includes some features
        of the Wang dedicated word processor</li>

        <li>Richard Stallman's EMACS editor has been imitated any
        number of times.</li>

        <li>Imitations of the IBM PC BIOS run in nearly all PC
        clones. The PC clones would be useless without doing
        this.</li>

        <li>The Unix user interface has been imitated many times,
        both in complete systems (Idris, Coherent, Minix, MARC,
        GNU, etc.) and in program suites that just clone the
        utilities (e.g. Software Tools; nearly every microcomputer
        C compiler I've seen comes with a few of these).</li>

        <li>All C compilers implement a special language (C) that
        used to be available only as part of Unix.</li>
      </ul>Non-computer examples (such as the many imitations of
      the Sony Walkman) are ok too.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1><a name="SEC9" href="bull3.html#TOC9" id="SEC9">GNU Software
  Available Now</a></h1>

  <ul>
    <li><b>GNU Emacs</b> In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the
    first Emacs: the extensible, customizable real-time display
    editor. GNU Emacs is his second implementation of Emacs. It's
    the first Emacs available on Unix systems which offers true
    Lisp, smoothly integrated into the editor, for writing
    extensions. It also provides a special interface to MIT's free
    X window system, which makes redisplay very fast. GNU Emacs has
    been in widespread use since 1985 and often, as at MIT's
    Project Athena, displaces proprietary implementations of Emacs
    because of its greater reliability as well as its good features
    and easier extensibility. GNU Emacs has run on many kinds of
    Unix systems: those made by Alliant (system release 1 or 2),
    Amdahl (UTS), AT&amp;T (3b machines and 7300 pc), Celerity,
    Digital (Vax, not PDP-11), Dual, Encore, Gould, HP (9000 series
    200 or 300 but not series 500), IBM (RT/PC running 4.2),
    Integrated Solutions (Optimum V with 68020 and VMEbus),
    Masscomp, Megatest, NCR (Tower 32), Plexus, Pyramid, Sequent,
    Silicon Graphics (Iris release 3.5), Stride (system release 2),
    Sun (any kind), Tahoe, Tektronix (NS16000 system), Texas
    Instruments (Nu), Whitechapel (MG1), and Wicat. These include
    both Berkeley Unix and System V (release 0, 2 or 2.2). It also
    runs on Apollo machines and on VAX/VMS. GNU Emacs use is
    described by the GNU Emacs Manual, available from the Free
    Software Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>GDB</b> GDB is the source-level C debugger written for
    the GNU project in 1986. It offers many features not usually
    found in debuggers on Unix, such as a history that records all
    values examined within the debugger for concise later
    reference, multi-line user-defined commands, and a strong
    self-documentation capability. It currently runs on Vaxes under
    4.2 and 4.3bsd, and on Suns (systems version 2 and 3). A
    version for the IBM RT-PC running 4.2bsd may be released soon.
    A users' manual for GDB is available from the Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>GNU CC</b> The GNU C compiler is a fairly portable
    optimizing compiler. It generates good code for the 68000,
    68020 and Vax. It features automatic register packing that
    makes register declarations unnecessary. It supports full ANSI
    C as of the latest draft standard. We are offering a beta test
    release to people wishing to help us find compiler bugs or
    begin work on ports. This testing version is distributed on a
    separate tape from the regular GNU distribution. When the
    compiler is more solid, it will become part of the regular
    tape.</li>

    <li><b>Bison</b> Bison is an upward-compatible replacement for
    YACC, with some additional as-yet-undocumented features. It has
    been in use for a couple of years.</li>

    <li><b>X Window System</b> X is a portable, network transparent
    window system for bitmap displays written at MIT and DEC. It
    currently runs on DEC VAXstation, Lexidata 90, and most Sun
    Microsystems displays, with others in the works. X supports
    overlapping windows, fully recursive subwindows, and provides
    hooks for several different styles of user interface.
    Applications provided include a terminal emulator, bitmap
    editor, several window managers, clock, window dump and undump
    programs, hardcopy printing program for the LN03 printer,
    several typesetting previewers, etc.</li>

    <li><b>MIT Scheme</b> Scheme is a simplified, lexically scoped
    dialect of Lisp, designed at MIT and other universities for two
    purposes: teaching students of programming, and researching new
    parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques. MIT
    Scheme is written in C and runs on many kinds of Unix systems.
    Sorry, there is no documentation for the current distribution
    version of MIT Scheme. A new standard for Scheme has been
    designed by the various labs that work on Scheme, and work is
    going on at MIT to change MIT Scheme to fit. Once that is done,
    the standard will serve as a manual for MIT Scheme. At that
    time, we will distribute both the new release of Scheme and the
    standard.</li>

    <li><b>GNU Chess</b> GNU Chess was written in 1986 by Stuart
    Cracraft of UCLA. It can use several machines in parallel for
    increased searching speed, and it comes with an interface to
    the X window system to display a pretty chessboard. It also has
    a human readable opening book of thousands of moves including
    several hundred games of Grandmaster Mikhail Tal. On a single
    Sun-3 CPU, the current version probably plays around Class C
    chess. Stuart continues to strengthen the program in various
    ways.</li>

    <li><b>Hack</b> Hack is a display oriented adventure game
    similar to Rogue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><a name="SEC11" href="bull3.html#TOC11" id="SEC11">Status of
  the GNU Project, June 1987</a></h1>

  <p>(See also the article "GNU Software Available Now", elsewhere
  in this issue).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>GNU Emacs and GDB</b> GNU Emacs and GDB are already
    released. Berkeley is distributing GNU Emacs with the 4.3
    distribution, and DEC is going to distribute it with Unix
    systems on Vaxes.</li>

    <li><b>Gsh, the GNU imitation C shell</b> Beta-test release of
    a C shell with input editing and compilation of shell scripts
    is expected soon. It was delayed due to illness. The same
    program is supposed to imitate sh, but that doesn't work
    yet.</li>

    <li><b>Kernel</b> We are negotiating with Prof. Rashid of
    Carnegie-Mellon University about working with them on the
    development of the MACH kernel. MACH is a message passing
    kernel that will probably succeed 4.3bsd as the standard kernel
    used for ARPA-sponsored operating system research. If an
    agreement is reached, we will use MACH as the kernel of GNU;
    otherwise, we will probably use a free remote procedure call
    kernel called TRIX, which was written at MIT. TRIX runs, and
    supports basic Unix compatibility, but needs a lot of new
    features.</li>

    <li><b>C compiler</b> RMS is now working on finishing a new
    portable optimizing C compiler. It supports the Oct 1986 draft
    of ANSI C and has compiled both itself and GNU Emacs. A second
    beta test version of the compiler has just been released. It
    fixes the bugs found in the March 1987 preliminary test
    release, but is still not considered ready for everyday use.
    The compiler performs automatic register allocation, common
    subexpression elimination, invariant code motion from loops,
    constant propagation and copy propagation, delaying popping of
    function call arguments, tail recursion elimination, plus many
    local optimizations that are automatically deduced from the
    machine description. By the time it is finished it will
    probably also know when to keep constant addresses in
    registers. We may also make some rearrangements in order to
    enable compilation of arbitrarily large functions in bounded
    amounts of memory, though with some decrease in optimization
    compared to what can be done with lots of memory. GCC makes
    shorter and faster 68020 code than the Sun compiler with -O. It
    makes shorter Vax code than the Tartan C compiler with -O4, but
    we haven't been able to compare the running speed of that code.
    Enough internal documentation is included for people interested
    in retargeting the compiler to other CPUs to get started. Our
    cpp now supports the Oct 1986 draft standard.</li>

    <li><b>Assembler</b> We have a partially-portable one-pass
    assembler that is almost twice as fast as the Unix assembler.
    It now works for Vaxes and the 68020.</li>

    <li><b>Window system</b> We plan to use the X window system
    written at MIT. This system is already available free.</li>

    <li><b>Documentation system</b> We now have a truly compatible
    pair of programs which can convert a file of texinfo format
    documentation into either a printed manual or an Info file. A
    Texinfo manual which describes how to write documents in
    Texinfo is available from the Foundation. Documentation files
    are needed for many utilities.</li>

    <li><b>Other Utilities</b> The GNU `ls', `grep', `awk', `make'
    and `ld' are in regular use. The other object-file management
    utilities are written too. Our free replacement for `yacc' is
    called `bison'. `cron' and `at' were recently submitted, and so
    was `m4'. `lex' is expected in June. A free stdio system has
    just been received.</li>

    <li>
      <b>Free Software Foundation</b> The foundation exists for two
      purposes: to accept gifts to support GNU development, and to
      carry out distribution. We are now tax exempt; you can deduct
      donations to us on your tax returns. Our address is
      <pre>
Free Software Foundation
1000 Mass Ave
Cambridge, MA 02138
</pre>and our phone number is (617) 876-3296. Because of the
confusion surrounding LMI's change of ownership, our phone service
was temporarily interrupted in May. We are still trying to
straighten everything out with the phone company. If you called us
and got a recording saying our number was disconnected, please keep
trying. We haven't gone out of business!
    </li>

    <li><b>Service directory</b> The foundation now maintains a
    Service Directory; a list of people who offer service to
    individual users of GNU Emacs and, eventually, all parts of the
    GNU system. Service can be answering questions for new users,
    customizing programs, porting to new systems, or anything
    else.</li>

    <li><b>Possible target machines</b> GNU will require a cpu that
    uses 32-bit addresses and integers and addresses to the 8-bit
    byte. 1 meg of core should be enough, though currently the GNU
    C compiler can require several meg for a large function. Unless
    we do a lot of work to fix this you probably need to have
    virtual memory. MACH also requires virtual memory. GNU Emacs
    requires more than a meg of addressable memory in the system,
    although a meg of physical memory is probably enough if there
    is virtual memory. A hard disk will be essential; at least 40
    meg will be needed to hold the system plus the source code plus
    the manual plus swapping space. Plus more space for the user's
    files, of course. The system binaries will probably fit in
    around 10 meg. We recommend 80 meg or more for a personal GNU
    system. This is not to say that it will be impossible to adapt
    some or all of GNU for other kinds of machines; but it may be
    difficult, and we don't consider it part of our job to try to
    reduce that difficulty. We have nothing to say about any
    specific models of microcomputer, as we do not follow hardware
    products.</li>

    <li><b>Porting</b> It is too early to inquire about porting GNU
    (except GNU Emacs and GNU CC). First, we have to finish
    it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="SEC12" href="bull3.html#TOC12" id="SEC12">Why Was
  Copyright Invented?</a></h2>

  <p>Now that copyright is becoming a public nuisance that the
  public tries to ignore, copyright owners try to justify this
  imposition by calling it an intrinsic right. As they tell it,
  their intrinsic right is a tradition that makes the public good
  irrelevant.</p>

  <p>This is contrary to the facts of the history of copyright.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court has stated explicitly what copyright was
  for. Writing for the Court, Justice Stewart explained:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a
    fair return for an "author's" creative labor. But the ultimate
    aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for
    the general public good. `The sole interest of the United
    States and the primary object in conferring the [copyright]
    monopoly,' this Court has said, `lie in the general benefits
    derived by the public from the labors of authors.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
<tt>             </tt>---Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal (286 US 123, 127)
</pre>

  <p>So when copyright interferes with the public use of a program,
  that directly attacks the reason for having copyright.</p>

  <h1><a name="SEC13" href="bull3.html#TOC13" id="SEC13">What is
  GNU Emacs and do you want a copy?</a></h1>

  <p>GNU Emacs is a new implementation of the Emacs text editor.
  (Recently text editors have been called "word processors" among
  microcomputer users.)</p>

  <p>Emacs is a kind of architecture for text editors, in which
  most editing commands are written in an interpreted language
  (usually Lisp) so that the user can write new editing commands as
  he goes. This allows Emacs to have editing commands that are more
  powerful or more adapted to individual uses than other kinds of
  editors.</p>

  <p>Any particular editing command could be written in C, but with
  Lisp it is much easier for users to change the editing commands
  or to implement new editing commands. Users can also exchange
  their adaptations and extensions of Emacs. The result is a
  library of extensions that continues to grow.</p>

  <p>GNU Emacs boasts an especially clean Lisp system for writing
  editing commands, and an already large library of extensions.</p>

  <p>GNU Emacs is written in C, designed for a Unix or Unix-like
  kernel. It includes its own Lisp interpreter which is used to
  execute the portion of the editor that is written in Lisp.</p>

  <p>It is a fairly large program, around 525k on vaxes or 68000s,
  to which must be added space for the files you are editing, undo
  buffers, Lisp libraries loaded, and Lisp data such as recently
  killed text, etc. This is not really a problem on a timeshared
  machine because most of that 525k is shared, but on a personal
  computer there may be nobody to share with. Thus, GNU Emacs
  probably could not be used on an IBM PC clone for lack of memory,
  unless you want to implement virtual memory in software within
  Emacs itself. Perhaps on an 80286 with 1 meg of memory you can
  win using their memory management.</p>

  <p>In general, a 32-bit machine with either a meg of real memory
  or virtual memory can probably run GNU Emacs, as long as a
  suitable Unix system call environment is provided, simulated or
  imitated.</p>

  <h1><a name="SEC14" href="bull3.html#TOC14" id="SEC14">GNU Wish
  List</a></h1>

  <p>Wishes for this issue:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Money and equipment, as usual.</li>

    <li>Some free office space in the Cambridge area.</li>

    <li>Volunteer programming, especially from people around
    Cambridge and people with experience writing operating system
    kernels. Help writing documentation is also needed.</li>

    <li>Artwork and other graphics, for use as illustrations in
    future FSF manuals and GNU's bulletins.</li>

    <li>Would anyone like to edit GNU's Bulletin #4?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="SEC15" href="bull3.html#TOC15" id="SEC15">Thank
  Gnus</a></h2>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation would like to send special thank
  gnus to the following:</p>

  <p>Thanks to the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. The LCS has
  provided FSF with the loan of a Microvax for program
  development.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Professor Dertouzos, head of LCS. His specific
  decision to support us is greatly appreciated.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory for
  invaluable assistance of many kinds.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Lisp Machine, Inc. LMI has generously provided
  office space, computer resources and a mailing address for FSF.
  Bruce Deffenbaugh in particular helped us keep our operation in
  relative calm during LMI's recent turmoil.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Inference Corp. Inference has been shipping copies
  of GNU Emacs to its customers in conjunction with some other
  products that they offer, and they have decided to donate $200 to
  Richard Stallman for each copy of Emacs they deliver in this way.
  This proves it is possible to make a living from writing free
  software.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Martin Minow of DEC for giving us an answering
  machine, so people can now phone us at (617) 876-3296. We check
  messages about once a week.</p>

  <p>Thanks to those who sent money and offered help. James R.
  Payne of Advanced Decision Systems gave especially freely. Thanks
  also to those who support us by ordering Emacs manuals and
  distribution tapes.</p>

  <p>The creation of this bulletin is our way of thanking all who
  have expressed interest in what we are doing.</p>
