<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="bull20.html#TOC5">What Is the FSF?</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced "guh-new") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</P>
<P>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have two specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and
distribute it to your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to
change a program as you wish, by having full access to source code.  You
can study the source and learn how such programs are written.  You may then
be able to port it, improve it, and share your changes with others.  If you
redistribute GNU software you may charge a distribution fee or give it
away, so long as you include the source code and the <I>GNU General Public
License</I>; see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</A>, for details.

</P>
<P>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</P>
<P>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</P>
<P>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President; <BR>
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="bull20.html#TOC6">What Is Copyleft?</A></H1>

<P>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.
But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <EM>all</EM> users.  To prevent this,
<EM>copyleft</EM> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</P>
<P>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <EM>GNU General Public License</EM> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <EM>GNU Library General
Public License</EM> (LGPL), applies to a few (but not most) GNU libraries.
This license permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables
under certain conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU
source code distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available
upon request.

</P>

<P>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each
license.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="bull20.html#TOC7">What Is the Hurd?</A></H1>

<P>
The Hurd will be the foundation of the GNU system.  It is a collection of
server processes that run on top of Mach, a free message-passing kernel
developed at CMU.  Mach's virtual memory management facilities are also
used by the Hurd.  The GNU C Library will provide the Unix system call
interface, using the Hurd servers for those services it can't provide
itself.
<BR>   <BR>
The Hurd will allow users to create and share useful projects without
knowing much about the internal workings of the system--projects that might
never have been attempted without freely available source, a well-designed
interface, and a multiple server design.  The Hurd is thus like other
expandable FSF projects, e.g. GNU Emacs and GUILE.

</P>

<P>
Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform
exists.  Right now we are using the University of Utah's Mach distribution
which we hope will be unified with the distribution produced by the Open
Software Foundation.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC11">GNUs Flashes</A> for a report on recent progress.
<BR>   <BR>
We need help with significant Hurd related projects.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should send mail
to <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C
Library to new systems is another way to help.
<BR>   <BR>
The Hurd is not yet ready for use, but in the meantime you can use a
GNU/Linux system.

</P>

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="bull20.html#TOC8">Conditions for Using Bison</A></H1>

<P>
As of Bison version 1.24, we have changed the distribution terms for
<CODE>yyparse</CODE> to permit using Bison's output in non-free programs.
Formerly, Bison parsers could only be used in programs that were free
software.

</P>
<P>
The other GNU tools, such as the GNU C compiler, have never had such a
requirement.  They could always be used for non-free software.  The reason
Bison was different was not due to a special policy decision; it resulted
from applying the usual GNU General Public License to all of the Bison
source code.

</P>
<P>
The output of the Bison utility--a parser file--contains a verbatim copy
of a sizable piece of Bison: the code for the <CODE>yyparse</CODE> function.
(The actions from your grammar are inserted into <CODE>yyparse</CODE> at one
point, but the rest of the function is not changed.)  When we applied the
GPL terms to the code for <CODE>yyparse</CODE>, the effect was to restrict the
use of Bison output to free software.

</P>
<P>
We didn't change the terms because of sympathy for people who want to
make software proprietary.  <STRONG>Software should be free.</STRONG>  But we
concluded that limiting Bison's use to free software was doing little to
encourage people to make other software free.  So we decided to make the
practical conditions for using Bison match the practical conditions for
using the other GNU tools.

</P>

<P>

<LI><B>GPL in Use at the University of Texas</B>

The University of Texas System now specifically allows the GNU General
Public License to be used by faculty at all 15 institutions to distribute
software they write.  Although the System provides opportunities for
faculty to commercialize their `inventions' to bring in revenue, it
recognizes circumstances under which software should be freely
redistributable.  The System states that the GPL offers "a convenient and
widely accepted method of public distribution that ensures the public
access to and use of software intended for their benefit.

<LI><B>Cancer Clinic Relies on Freely Redistributable Software</B>

The Roger Maris Cancer Center in Fargo, ND, sees about 1500 new patients
each year.  They are using a network of GNU/Linux systems to run the
Center's information system, coordinate drug therapies, and perform many
other functions.  This environment needs to be available to the Center's
staff at a moment's notice.  According to Dr. G.W. Wettstein, "the
proper care of our cancer patients would not be what it is today without
Linux ... The tools that we have been able to deploy from free software
channels have enabled us to write and develop innovative applications
which ... do not exist through commercial avenues."

<LI><B>Hurd</B>   (Also see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC7">What Is the Hurd?</A>)

Much important progress has been made on the Hurd.  Reliability has been
greatly improved, thanks to a variety of small bug fixes.  The TCP/IP
support is now in place, with much of the code borrowed from GNU/Linux.
Telnet, FTP, <CODE>rsh</CODE>, and so forth all work.  The NFS client
implementation is almost finished as we go to press, and will probably be
working by the time you read this.

Look for an alpha release sometime soon; when that is ready, we will solicit
volunteers using the Hurd announcements list.  To be added to this list,
send mail to <CODE>hurd-announce-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI><B>The GNU Music Project</B>

GNU Music provides tools for manipulating various representations of music.
Currently, it is concentrating on tools to edit, print, and play musical
scores.  The project allows for rhythmic, tonal music based on the
traditional seven note scale; it aims to provide an interesting environment
for musicians.  To help test GNU Music, send mail to
<CODE>majordomo@iro.umontreal.ca</CODE> with a line that says
<SAMP>`subscribe music-pretest'</SAMP> in the body.

<LI><B>A New FSF T-shirt!</B>   (See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC58">FSF T-shirt</A>)

We have a new T-shirt.  This design was inspired by the cover of the
<CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE>.

<LI><B>The Free Model Foundation</B>

The Free Model Foundation (FMF) was created recently as a "focal point for
access, creation, and distribution of simulation and analysis models".  It
provides freely redistributable software for tool and component vendors and
their customers.  The FMF has already created an archive of these models of
electronic components (see <TT>`http://www.vhdl.org/vi/fmf'</TT>); all
models are software and thus covered by the GNU General Public License.

Presently, the FMF is seeking contributions in the form of software
programming (C, C++, Verilog, VHDL/VITAL), hardware, EDA software, models,
and other resources in support of this operation.  For more information,
see the FMF's Web Site, or contact <CODE>Luis.Garcia@vhdl.org</CODE>.

<LI><B>GLPed Wind Tunnel Data Analyzer</B>

Want to fly high?  Michael Selig, at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, has released a program that contains the results of wind
tunnel tests on wings for model airplanes.  This information is useful to
model airplane builders and designers.  The program is released under the
GNU General Public License.  See <TT>`http://uxh.cso.uiuc.edu/~selig/'</TT>.

<LI><B>Cyclic Software Does CVS!</B>     (See item CVS in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

Windows NT and Windows 95, &#38; many others.

<LI><B>Utah Flux Project Software</B>

<B>Mach 4</B> is a new version of the Mach kernel which comes in two flavors.
The x86 version increases Mach 3's ease of use &#38; practicality in a PC
environment; has a much simpler GNU--style build environment; boots using
GNU/Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, or Mach boot loaders; has source-compatibility with
GNU/Linux network device drivers (&#38; block device drivers soon); new device
drivers; &#38; support for the Lites server.  Utah provides sources &#38;
pre-built binaries for the kernel &#38; Lites server, and the compiler tools to
build Mach 4 under GNU/Linux, NetBSD, or FreeBSD.  The PA-RISC 1.1 (HP
700) version includes the new build environment, some research on
improving Mach RPC, &#38; complete HP 700 support.  It is less robust than
the x86 version.  To get on the list, send mail to
<CODE>mach4-users-request@cs.utah.edu</CODE>.

<B>Lites</B> is a usable Mach-based Unix single server based on 4.4 BSD--Lite,
originally done by CMU &#38; HUT.  x86 Lites supports binary compatibility with
GNU/Linux, NetBSD, &#38; FreeBSD, &#38; groks GNU/Linux filesystems.  Utah distributes the
current Lites version, with binaries for x86 &#38; PA-RISC.  The PA version
runs BSD/ELF &#38; most HP-UX binaries.
<BR>   <BR>
<B>OMOS</B> is a fully programmable class server/linker/loader using Scheme as
its meta-language &#38; the BFD package for portability.  x86/a.out &#38;
PA-RISC/SOM are supported.

<LI><B>New Compiler Tools CD-ROM</B>  

We have a new edition of the Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM with updated
versions of much of its software.
It contains executables of the GNU compiler tools
for some systems that don't normally come with a compiler.  This allows
users of those systems to compile their own software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.
<BR>   <BR>
We hope to include more systems with each update of this CD-ROM.  If you
can help build binaries for new systems or have one to suggest,
please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

<H1><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="bull20.html#TOC13">Free Software Redistributors Donate</A></H1>

<P>
The <B>SNOW 2.1 CD</B> producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to the
FSF" to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how
much of the price is for the FSF &#38; how much is for the redistributor.
<BR>   <BR>
The <B>Sun Users Group Deutschland</B> &#38; <B>ASCII Corporation</B> (Japan)
have added donations to the FSF to the price of their next GNU
software CD-ROMs.
<BR>   <BR>
<B>Austin Code Works</B>, a free software redistributor, supports
free software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling price for
the GNU software CDs they produce &#38; sell.
<BR>   <BR>
<B>Walnut</B> <B>Creek</B> <B>CDROM</B> &#38; <B>Info</B> <B>Magic</B>,
free software redistributors, are also giving us part of
their selling price.
<BR>   <BR>
<B>TOHDO-SHA</B> is donating 400 yen to the FSF for each copy of
<CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, Japanese Edition</CITE>
sold at bookstores in Japan.
<BR>   <BR>
<B>CQ Publishing</B> made a large donation from the sales of their
GAWK book in Japanese.

</P>
<P>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.
<BR>   <BR>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</P>
<P>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</P>
<P>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated,"
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</P>
<P>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler or Mach contribute more; major new features and programs
contribute the most.

</P>
<P>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="bull20.html#TOC14">Free Software Support</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our
mission is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way
to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers do now; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="bull20.html#TOC15">Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund Appeal</A></H1>

<P>
Phil Zimmermann, who wrote the public-key encryption program known as
Pretty Good Privacy ("PGP") and released it on the Internet, is facing
prosecution for "exporting" it out of the United States.

</P>
<P>
There is a law prohibiting the export of encryption software from the
US.  Zimmermann did not do this, but the U.S. Government hopes to
establish that posting an encryption program on a BBS
or on the Internet constitutes exporting it--in effect, stretching
export control into domestic censorship.

</P>
<P>
If the U.S. Government wins, that will have a chilling effect on the free
flow of information on the global network, as well as on everyone's privacy
from government snooping.

</P>
<P>
Estimates are that Zimmermann's defense will cost over $100,000--and that
doesn't even count lawyers' fees.  To help pay this, a legal trust fund,
the Philip Zimmermann Defense Fund (PZDF), has been setup.  Donations
are accepted by check, money order, credit card, or wire transfer;
and in any currency.

In the last GNU's Bulletin, we said the LPF would file an Amicus Brief with
the Supreme Court.  In fact, we went one better by collecting a very
impressive list of over 80 signatures of prominent computer scientists.  We
also wrote &#38; filed a brief on behalf of the LPF, &#38; contributed to another
brief filed on behalf of an ad-hoc organization ("Computer Scientists in

Win or lose in the Supreme Court, the next battle the LPF fights will be in
the Congress.  It seems unlikely (though not impossible, so we'll keep
trying) that the Courts or the Patent &#38; Trademark Office will reverse the
current software patent situation.  If we lose in the Supreme Court, we
will have to try to change the copyright law as well.  Therefore, it is
very important to get more members.  Membership is what will get us the
most clout with Congress.  In the next year, we will need to gear up to
promote our ideas more widely, both inside &#38; outside of the software world.
Your help &#38; support is very important to the success of this effort, so

<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="bull20.html#TOC22">Status of ICOT Free Software</A></H3>

<P>
Many programs in the field of parallel processing and knowledge processing
were released to the public under the name of "ICOT Free Software (IFS)"
in the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project.  IFS was an 11-year
Japanese project started in 1982 and FGCS was its 2-year follow-on project.

</P>
<P>
These programs have been accessed by more than 3,300 persons and almost
18,000 files have been transferred since their first release in 1992.  As
ICOT was wound up in June, 1995, maintenance and further development of IFS
was transferred to Japan Information Processing Development Center
(JIPDEC).  JIPDEC established a new research institute called "Laboratory
for Advanced Information Technology".  The Laboratory not only maintains,
develops, and distributes IFS, but also develops parallel knowledge
processing software in collaboration with several Japanese universities.
Newly developed software will be released to the public with conditions
similar to those of IFS.

<H1><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="bull20.html#TOC23">Help the GNU Translation Project</A></H1>

<P>
GNU is going international!  Our Translation Project gets
users, translators, and maintainers together, so GNU will gradually
speak many native languages.
<BR>   <BR>

</P>
<P>
To complete the GNU Translation Project, we need many people who
like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to
synergize with other translators speaking the same language as part of
"translation teams".

<P>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</P>

<LI><B>GNU C Library</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>.)

While there has not been a new release of our C library in some time, a
great deal of work is going on; we hope for a new release in the next few
months.  Much of Roland's recent work has focused on support for GNU/Hurd,
where the library does much more work than in Unix (see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC7">What Is the Hurd?</A>).  He has also been working closely with Ulrich Drepper on support
for GNU/Linux; we intend a future release of the GNU C library to
compatibly supersede the heavily modified version now used with GNU/Linux.
The new release will add several new functions traditionally found in Unix
systems &#38; some small new GNU extensions, as well as major new
internationalization support.  Ulrich Drepper has contributed to the
library a great deal in the last few months, by writing new floating-point
printing/reading functions that are perfectly accurate &#38; much faster than
the old code.  He has also written a complete set of internationalization
features including POSIX.2-compatible <CODE>locale</CODE> &#38; <CODE>localedef</CODE>
programs, &#38; catalogs for displaying program messages in languages other
than English.  The library now builds as a shared library for systems that
use the ELF object file format.  Included is the run-time loader
<CODE>ld.so</CODE> which sets up the shared libraries when a program runs; it
works now with the Hurd &#38; Linux kernels, and is easy to port to other ELF
systems such as SVR4 &#38; Solaris 2.

<LI><B>GNU Emacs</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

Future versions of Emacs will: save the undo history in a file (which allows
you to undo older changes in the history); also have support for
variable-width fonts, wide character sets, and the world's major languages.
Our long term plan is to move it in the direction of a WYSIWYG word
processor &#38; make it easier for beginners to use.

<LI><B>GNUStep</B>   (Also see "Objective-C Library" in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement over two years ago, there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, named GNUStep.  Work has begun on GNUStep, starting from a
library written in Objective-C.  Much remains to be done to
bring this library close to the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should
contact <CODE>office@gnustep.org</CODE>.  Check
<TT>`http://www.gnustep.org/gnustep'</TT> for more
info.

<LI><CODE>recode</CODE>    (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

The next <CODE>recode</CODE> release should give more flexible control over
encodings of charsets, offer MIME conversions, &#38; handle ISO-10646
(Unicode).  It will install a library &#38; support files to help work towards
internationalizing GNU.

<LI><B>GUILE</B>

GNU's Ubiquitous Extension Language is an SCM-based library which
programmers can use to make any ordinary C program extensible.
(For info on SCM, see "JACAL" in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>.)
<BR>   <BR>
GUILE already includes a POSIX.1 interface, an SCSH-like
library, a module system, a Tk interface, &#38; a byte-code interpreter;
support for Emacs Lisp &#38; a more C-like language is coming.
<BR>   <BR>
Get snapshots from <TT>`ftp.cygnus.com:/pub/lord'</TT>.

<LI><CODE>ptx</CODE>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

The next release of <CODE>ptx</CODE> should offer contextualized support for SGML
texts, as the first step towards a major overhaul for that package.

<LI><B>GNU Common Lisp</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

Version 2.2 of GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was released in November '95.  It now
includes a graphical interface to the Tk widget system.  All documentation
is now Texinfo-based, with built-in regexp matching used to access the
documentation.  A first pass at the Common Lisp condition system is also
included.  Some new ports include DEC Alpha
and ELF for GNU/Linux.  Volunteers to help with the move to the ANSI standard
are most welcome; contact <CODE>schelter@math.utexas.edu</CODE>.

<LI><B>C Interpreter</B>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
task is partly finished.  GCC has generated byte code for all supported
languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
finish this work has begun.  To make this work usable, we need to enhance
GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We would also like support for
compiling just a few selected functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI><B>GCC</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

New front ends for GCC are being developed for Pascal and Chill.  See the
GNU Fortran and GNAT items in this article for news on those front ends.

<LI><B>GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator</B>   <EM>Not yet available from the FSF</EM>

A front end for much of Ada 95 (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is available
via anonymous FTP from <CODE>cs.nyu.edu</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/gnat'</TT>.  SGI and
Digital have chosen GNU Ada as the Ada compiler for certain systems.
News about
GNAT is posted to the USENET newsgroup <CODE>comp.lang.ada</CODE>.

<LI><B>GNU Fortran</B>   (For info on <CODE>f2c</CODE> &#38; GCC, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

The GNU Fortran (<CODE>g77</CODE>) front end is stable, but work is needed to
bring its overall packaging, feature set, &#38; performance up to the levels
the Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: improving
documentation &#38; diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially
for large initialized data tables; implementing <CODE>INTEGER*2</CODE>,
<CODE>INTEGER*8</CODE>, &#38; similar features; allowing intrinsics in <CODE>PARAMETER</CODE>
statements; &#38; providing debug information on <CODE>COMMON</CODE> &#38; <CODE>EQUIVALENCE</CODE>
variables.  We don't know when these things will be done,
but hope some will be finished in the coming months.  You can speed
progress by working on them or by offering funding.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <CODE>g77</CODE>.  To subscribe,
ask <CODE>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  To contact the
developer of <CODE>g77</CODE> or get current status, write or finger
<CODE>fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI><B>Ghostscript</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

Ghostscript 3.0 will be distributed by the FSF soon.  It will implement
nearly the full Postscript Level 2 language except for LZW compression,
which can't be freely implemented because of software patents.
(Prohibitions on programming like this are what the League for Programming
Freedom is fighting.  See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC16">What Is the LPF?</A>, for details.)

<LI><CODE>gmp</CODE>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

The next version of the GNU <CODE>mp</CODE> library, 2.0, will have arbitrary
precision floating point arithmetic, and expanded support for integer and
rational number arithmetic.  <CODE>gmp</CODE> 2.0 is up to 4 times faster than
previous versions.  In particular, the speed of multiplication, division,
and GCD has improved.

<LI><B>Oleo</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

Volunteers are writing an Oleo manual and extensions to the Oleo interface.

<LI><B>Smalltalk</B>   (For current status, see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>)

The next release, version 1.2, will use Autoconf.  It
will have substantial performance improvements &#38; memory requirement
reductions, more control over memory allocation, ability to use the
Smalltalk interpreter as a C callable library, better X Window System
interfaces, ability to represent and manipulate C data structures in
Smalltalk, conditional compilation facilities, large integer support, an
advanced GUI-based class browsing system, better
TCP/IP interfaces, exception support, weak references, &#38; finalization
support.  It will run on Unix, DOS, &#38; Windows NT.

<LI><B>The Dictionary Project</B>

The FSF has a copy of the unabridged <CITE>Century Dictionary</CITE>, now in the
public domain, and we are planning to put it online.  We tried OCR, but it
wasn't reliable enough.
<BR>   <BR>
Russell Nelson is coordinating the project.  Volunteers have entered close
to fifty pages so far, but the project needs more help; to volunteer, send
mail to <CODE>dictionary@gnu.ai.mit.edu</CODE> or contact the FSF.

<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="bull20.html#TOC26">Configuring GNU Software</A></H3>

<P>
We are using, Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software
packages in order to compile them (see "Autoconf"
below, in this article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the
same alternatives for naming machine and system types.
<BR>   <BR>
Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system
all at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package
separately.
<BR>   <BR>
You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.
Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

<LI><CODE>acm</CODE>   (SrcCD, UtilT)

<CODE>acm</CODE> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

<LI><B>apache</B>   (SrcCD)

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for version 1.3
or 1.4 of the NCSA server.  It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA server and
includes many frequently requested new features, and has an API which
allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily.

<LI><B>Autoconf</B>   (SrcCD, UtilT)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <CODE>m4</CODE> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <CODE>m4</CODE> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

<LI><B>BASH</B>   (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU's shell, BASH (<B>B</B>ourne <B>A</B>gain <B>SH</B>ell), is compatible with the
Unix <CODE>sh</CODE> and offers many extensions found in <CODE>csh</CODE> and
<CODE>ksh</CODE>.  BASH has job control, <CODE>csh</CODE>-style command history,
command-line editing (with Emacs and <CODE>vi</CODE> modes built-in, and the
ability to rebind keys) via the <CODE>readline</CODE> library.  BASH conforms to the
POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

<LI><CODE>bc</CODE>   (DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

<CODE>bc</CODE> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992
standard, with several extensions including multi-character variable names,
an <CODE>else</CODE> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <CODE>dc</CODE> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> is not implemented as a <CODE>dc</CODE> preprocessor.

<LI><B>BFD</B>   (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

The <B>B</B>inary <B>F</B>ile <B>D</B>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <CODE>ld</CODE> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet
published on paper).
<BR>   <BR>
At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.

<LI><B>Binutils</B>   (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD; <CODE>gas</CODE> only on VMSCmpT)

Binutils includes these programs:
<CODE>ar</CODE>,
<CODE>c<TT>++</TT>filt</CODE>,
<CODE>demangle</CODE>,
<CODE>gas</CODE>,
<CODE>gprof</CODE>,
<CODE>ld</CODE>,
<CODE>nlmconv</CODE>,
<CODE>nm</CODE>,
<CODE>objcopy</CODE>,
<CODE>objdump</CODE>,
<CODE>ranlib</CODE>,
<CODE>size</CODE>,
<CODE>strings</CODE>,
&#38;
<CODE>strip</CODE>.

Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, <CODE>gas</CODE>,
supports the a29k, Alpha, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS,
NS32K, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax and Z8000 CPUs, and attempts to be compatible
with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It can produce
mixed C-and-assembly listings, and includes a macro facility similar to
that in some other assemblers.  GNU's linker <CODE>ld</CODE> emits source-line
numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined
references, and interprets a superset of AT&#38;T's Linker Command Language,
which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
<CODE>nlmconv</CODE> converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
<CODE>objdump</CODE> can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and
can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format
read by BFD.

<LI><B>Bison</B>   (BinCD,DjgpD,DosBC,LangT,SrcCD,VMSCmpT)<B>[FSFman,FSFrc]</B>

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<CODE>yacc</CODE>.  Texinfo source for the <CITE>Bison Manual</CITE>
and reference card are included.  See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC56">GNU Documentation</A>.
<BR>   <BR>
A recent policy change allows non-free programs to use Bison-generated
parsers.  See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC8">Conditions for Using Bison</A>.

<LI><B>C Library</B>   (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD) <B>[FSFman]</B>

The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most of the
functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible with 4.4BSD and
includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

The C Library performs many functions of the Unix system calls in
the GNU/Hurd.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <CODE>malloc</CODE> which
wastes less memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU regular-expression
functions (<CODE>regex</CODE> and <CODE>rx</CODE>) now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2
standard.

GNU <CODE>stdio</CODE> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <CODE>fmemopen</CODE> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <CODE>printf</CODE> formats to use a C function you have written.  For
example, you can safely use format strings from user input to implement
a <CODE>printf</CODE>-like function for another programming language.
Extended <CODE>getopt</CODE> functions are already used to parse options,
including long options, in many GNU utilities.

The C Library runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2), HP
9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation (Ultrix
4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486/Pentium (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2, &#38;
SCO ODT 2.0),
Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3), &#38; SGI (Irix 4).  See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC24">Forthcoming GNUs</A>.  Texinfo source for the <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> is
included (see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC56">GNU Documentation</A>.

<LI><B>C<TT>++</TT> Library</B>   (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU C<TT>++</TT> library (libg<TT>++</TT>) contains an extensive collection of
C<TT>++</TT> <EM>forest</EM> classes, an IOStream library for input/output
routines, and support tools for use with G<TT>++</TT>.  Supported classes
include: Obstacks, multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex
numbers, arbitrary length Strings, BitSets, and BitStrings.
<BR>   <BR>
The distribution also includes the libstdc<TT>++</TT> library.
This implements library facilities defined by the forthcoming
ANSI/ISO C++ standard, including a port of the Standard Template Library.

<LI><B>Calc</B>   (DosBC, LspEmcT, SrcCD) <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator &#38; mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
can use Calc just as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many
more features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
logarithmic, trigonometric, &#38; financial functions; arbitrary precision;
complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
algebraic simplification; differentiation &#38; integration.  It outputs to
<CODE>gnuplot</CODE>, &#38; comes with source for a manual &#38; reference card
(see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC56">GNU Documentation</A>).

<LI><CODE>cfengine</CODE>   (SrcCD, UtilT)

<CODE>cfengine</CODE> is used for maintaining site-wide configuration of a
heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
appearance is similar to <CODE>rdist</CODE>, but also allows many more operations
to be performed automatically.
See Mark Burgess, "A Site Configuration Engine", <CITE>Computing
Systems</CITE>, Vol. 8, No. 3 (ask <CODE>office@usenix.org</CODE> how to

<LI><B>Chess</B>   (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

GNU Chess enables most modern computers to play a full game of chess.  It
supports a plain terminal interface, a curses interface, and a spiffy X
Window interface via <CODE>xboard</CODE>.
<BR>   <BR>
Improvements this past year include fixes to the game analyzer,
book, &#38; hash table; smartening up draw and mate; improved
thinking on opponent's time; Autoconf installation; a makefile
for Windows NT compilation; forward pruning; unlimited quiescence
captures; improved evaluation; improved null &#38; time control logic;
&#38; repetition-detection.

<LI><B>CLISP</B>   (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
It mostly supports the Lisp described by <CITE>Common LISP: The Language
(2nd edition)</CITE> and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a foreign language
interface, and, for some machines, a screen editor.  The user interface
language (English, German, French) is choosable at run time.  Major
packages that run in CLISP include CLX &#38; Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB of
memory &#38; runs on many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2,
Windows NT, Amiga 500--4000, Acorn RISC PC) &#38; Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux,
Sun4, SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTStep, &#38; others).

<LI><B>Common Lisp</B>   <EM>See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC24">Forthcoming GNUs</A></EM>   (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
&#38; interpreter for Common Lisp.
GCL is very portable &#38; extremely
efficient on a wide class of applications, &#38; compares favorably in
performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover &#38;
symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.
<BR>   <BR>
GCL compiles to C &#38; then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args &#38; one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in
registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted
code &#38; displays source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler
(based on the C profiling tools) counts function calls &#38; the time spent in
each function.

There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs
in a separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp
computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
interface.

There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
does PCL (see
"PCL" later in this article).  See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC24">Forthcoming GNUs</A>, for plans

<LI><B>Emacs 19</B>   (DosBC, EmcsD, LspEmcT, SrcCD) <B>[FSFman(s), FSFrc]</B>

Emacs 19 works with character-only terminals &#38; with the X Window System
(with or without an X toolkit).  New features in Emacs 19 include: multiple
X windows ("frames" to Emacs), with a separate X window for the
minibuffer or a minibuffer attached to each X window;
property lists associated with regions of text in a buffer;
multiple fonts &#38; colors defined by those properties;
simplified/improved processing of function keys, mouse clicks, and mouse
movement;
X selection processing, including clipboard selections;
hooks to be run if the point or mouse moves outside a certain range;
menu bars and popup menus defined by keymaps;
scrollbars;
before- &#38; after-change hooks;
a source-level debugger for Emacs Lisp programs;
floating point numbers;
improved buffer allocation, including returning
storage to the system when a buffer is killed;
interfacing with the X resource manager;
many updated libraries;
integrated support for version control systems (RCS, CVS, &#38; SCCS);
Autoconf based configuration;
and
support for
European character sets.

Recent features include
the ability to open frames on more than one X display from a single Emacs job,
operation on MS-DOS, MS Windows, and Windows NT,
displaying multiple views of an outline at the same time,
support for the Athena &#38; Motif widgets,
version control support for CVS and for multiple branches,
text properties for formatting text,
commands to edit text properties and save them in files,
and
GNU-standard long-named command line options.

<LI><CODE>es</CODE>   (SrcCD, UtilT)

<CODE>es</CODE> is an extensible shell (based on <CODE>rc</CODE>) with first class
functions, lexical scope, exceptions and rich return values (i.e.,
functions can return values other than just numbers).  <CODE>es</CODE>'s
extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the shell's
built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.  Like <CODE>rc</CODE>,
it is great for both interactive use and scripting, particularly since
its quoting rules are much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

<LI><B>Finger</B>   (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger <EM>server</EM>
host and other hosts at that site configured as finger <EM>clients</EM>.  The
server host collects information about who is logged in on the clients.  To
finger a user at a GNU Finger site, a query to any of its client hosts gets
useful information.  GNU Finger supports many customization features,
including user output filters and site programmable output for special
target names.

<LI><B>GCC</B>   (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCmpT) <B>[FSFman]</B>

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C<TT>++</TT>, and
Objective-C; the source
file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.
Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <CODE>object</CODE>, but see "GNUStep" in
section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC24">Forthcoming GNUs</A>).
As much as possible,
G<TT>++</TT> is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not
with <CODE>cfront</CODE> (AT&#38;T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

The GNU C Compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which
performs automatic register allocation, common sub-expression
elimination, invariant code motion from loops, induction variable
optimizations, constant propagation and copy propagation, delayed
popping of function call arguments, tail recursion elimination,
integration of inline functions and frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf
function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, a certain
amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE) between basic blocks
(though not all of the supported machine descriptions provide for
scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes to
instructions, and many local optimizations that are automatically
deduced from the machine description.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <CODE>long long
int</CODE>).  It supports extended floating point (type <CODE>long double</CODE>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.

GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C, &#38; GNU C extensions (including:
nested functions support, nonlocal gotos, &#38; taking the address of a label).

GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, &#38; DWARF.

<LI><B>GDB</B>   (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD) <B>[FSFman, FSFrc]</B>

GDB, the <B>G</B>NU <B>D</B>e<B>B</B>ugger, is a source-level debugger for C,
C<TT>++</TT>, &#38; Fortran.

GDB can debug both C and C<TT>++</TT> programs, and will work with executables
produced by many different compilers; however, C<TT>++</TT> debugging will have
some limitations if you do not use GCC.

GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has a GDB mode.
Two X interfaces (not
distributed or maintained by the FSF) are: <CODE>gdbtk</CODE> (FTP it from
<CODE>ftp.cygnus.com</CODE> in directory <TT>`/pub/gdb'</TT>); and
<CODE>xxgdb</CODE> (FTP it from <CODE>ftp.x.org</CODE> in directory
<TT>`/contrib/utilities'</TT>).

Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
(breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
has simulators for the
Hitachi H8/300, H8/500, Super-H, &#38; Zilog Z8001/2.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <EM>targets</EM> a platform
means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB can
<EM>host</EM> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
necessarily debug native programs.

See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC23">Help the GNU Translation Project</A>.

<LI><B>Ghostscript</B>   (DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU release of Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript graphics
language (see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC24">Forthcoming GNUs</A>, for future plans).

The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 2.6.2.  Features include the ability
to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript runs (X
Window System &#38; Microsoft (MS) Windows), resulting in much better-looking
screen displays; improved text file printing (like <CODE>enscript</CODE>); a
utility to extract the text from a Postscript language document; a much more
reliable (and faster) MS Windows implementation; support for
MS C/C<TT>++</TT> 7.0; drivers for many new printers
( e.g. the SPARCprinter),
&#38; for TIFF/F (Fax) file format; many more Postscript Level
2 facilities, including most of the color space facilities (but not
patterns); &#38; the ability to switch between Level 1 &#38; Level 2
dynamically.  Version 2.6.2 adds a LaserJet 4 driver &#38; several
important bug fixes to version 2.6.1.

Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language by writing
directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to files for
printing later or manipulating with other graphics programs.
<BR>   <BR>
Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports

<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="bull20.html#TOC33">Scheme Tape</A></H3>

<P>
Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed
at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming and
to research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

</P>
<P>
This tape now has MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the
"Revised^4 Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
(MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source is included.
It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries that can be used to bootstrap it exist for:
HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700, &#38; 800 (running HP-UX 9.0),
NeXT (NeXT OS 2 or 3.2),
DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
IBM RS/6000 (AIX),
Sun-3 or Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1),
DECstation 3100/5100 (Ultrix 4.0),
Sony NeWS-3250 (NEWS OS 5.01),
&#38;
Intel i386 (MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or NT).
If your system is not on this list &#38; you don't enjoy the bootstrap
challenge, see "JACAL" in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC25">GNU Software</A>.

</P>

<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="bull20.html#TOC34">X11 Tapes</A></H3>

<P>
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 6 of the X Window System.
The first tape has all of the core software, documentation, &#38; some
contributed clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is
necessary for running X or Emacs under X.  The second, "optional" tape
has contributed libraries &#38; toolkits, the Andrew User Interface System,
games, etc.
<BR>   <BR>
The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released for programs on
both tapes.  See section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC54">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</A>.
<BR>   <BR>
While supplies last, we will distribute X11R5 on the section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC48">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</A>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="bull20.html#TOC35">Berkeley 4.4BSD-Lite Tape</A></H3>

<P>
The "4.4BSD--Lite" release is the last from the Computer Systems
Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley.  It has most of
the BSD software system, except for a few files that remain proprietary.
It is much more complete than the previous "Net2" release.

</P>

<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="bull20.html#TOC36">VMS Emacs and VMS Compiler Tapes</A></H3>

<P>
We offer two VMS tapes.  One has just GNU Emacs 18.59 (none of the other
software on the section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC31">Lisps/Emacs Tape</A>, is included).  The other has GCC
2.3.3, Bison 1.19 (to compile GCC), <CODE>gas</CODE> 1.38 (to assemble GCC's output), and
some library and include files (none of the other software on the
section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC30">Languages Tape</A>, is included).  We are not aware of a GDB port for
VMS.  Both VMS tapes have DEC VAX executables from which you can bootstrap,
as the DEC VMS C compiler cannot compile GCC.  We do not have executables
for DEC Alpha VMS systems.
Please do not ask us to devote effort to VMS support, because it is
peripheral to the GNU Project.

<EM>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea,
which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to
himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.
Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because
every other possesses the whole of it ... Inventions then
cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.</EM>

<H1><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="bull20.html#TOC37">CD-ROMs</A></H1>

<P>
We offer these CD-ROMs:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>Several editions of our section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC45">Source Code CD-ROMs</A>.

<LI>December 1995 section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC42">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A>.

<LI>December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC64">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

<LI>December 1993 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the

see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC64">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

<LI>section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC43">MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM</A>.

<LI>section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC44">Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM</A>.

</UL>

<P>
Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format &#38; can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it you can mount each
CD with "Rock Ridge" extensions (the MS-DOS CD-ROM is only in ISO
9660 format), &#38; it will look just like an ordinary Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated &#38; otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</P>
<P>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</P>

<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="bull20.html#TOC38">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</A></H3>

<P>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the December 1995
Source CDs costs $240.  It costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out
of your own pocket.  The December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

</P>

<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="bull20.html#TOC39">What do the Different Prices Mean?</A></H4>

<P>
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</P>
<P>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the December 1995 Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROM, we charge just $60.
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.

</P>
<P>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</P>
<P>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
140 Source CDs at that price support an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="bull20.html#TOC40">Why is There an Individual Price?</A></H4>

<P>
In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

</P>
<P>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="bull20.html#TOC41">Is There a Maximum Price?</A></H4>

<P>
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will

<H3><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="bull20.html#TOC42">December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A></H3>

<P>
We now have the third edition of our CD-ROM that has binaries
and complete sources for GNU
compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler.  This enables the
people who use these systems to compile GNU and other free software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.  You can also use these GNU tools to
compile your own C/C<TT>++</TT>/Objective-C programs.  Older editions of
this CD are available while supplies last at a reduced price; see the
see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC64">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</P>
<P>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

<P>
We are working on our first book describing GNU Software for MS-DOS,

It will include a CD-ROM with all the sources &#38; binaries on the MS-DOS
Diskettes and more.
<BR>   <BR>
Please do NOT contact us about this book until we announce it on our

but we do not know when it will be finished.
Please do NOT contact us about this book until we announce it on our

<BR>   <BR>
A CD will be inside the book with sources &#38; binaries for Debian GNU/Linux,
which is a complete operating system for i386/i486/Pentium.  It is a
GNU/Linux system--that is to say, a variant GNU system which uses Linux as
the kernel.  (All the systems now available that use the Linux kernel are
GNU/Linux systems, see item "Linux" in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC59">Free Software for Microcomputers</A>.)

Debian is being developed by Ian Murdock and the Debian Association in
conjunction with the Free Software Foundation.  We are distributing it
as an interim measure until the GNU kernel (the Hurd) is ready for
users.

<H1><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="bull20.html#TOC54">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</A></H1>

<P>
If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest GNU developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent
to three tapes or CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you
four new versions of the tape of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.
The tapes are sent each quarter; the CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued
(currently twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent).

</P>
<P>
Regularly, we will send you a new version of a
Lisps/Emacs, Languages, Utilities, or X Window System (X11R6) Required tape,
or the Source CD-ROM.  The MIT Scheme and X Window System Optional
tapes are not changed often enough to warrant quarterly updates.  We do not
yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools
Binaries or our new Books with CD-ROM.

</P>
<P>
Since Emacs 19 is on the Lisps/Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a
subscription to either is an easy way to keep current with Emacs 19 as it
evolves.

</P>
<P>
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the
X Window System.  We update the X11R6 Required tape as fixes and patches
are issued throughout the year.  Each edition of the section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC45">Source Code CD-ROMs</A>, also has updated sources for the required part of the X Window
System.

</P>
<P>
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're
in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you must
add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "Unix and VMS Software" and
"Shipping Instructions" on the
see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC64">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

<P>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source code, the
Deluxe Distribution includes a complete set of our printed manuals and
reference cards.

</P>
<P>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</P>
<P>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine close to us.  However, we
can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system -- porting is a separate matter (to commission a port,
consult the GNU Service Directory; details in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC14">Free Software Support</A>).
Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an
unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for a common machine.
Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

</P>
<P>
We supply the software in one of these tape formats in Unix <CODE>tar</CODE>
format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -- QIC24,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in c.t. -- QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm c.t., or
DAT 4mm c.t.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</P>
<P>
The manuals included are one each of the <CITE>Bison</CITE>, <CITE>Calc</CITE>,
<CITE>GAWK</CITE>, <CITE>GNU C Compiler</CITE>, <CITE>GNU C Library</CITE>, <CITE>GDB</CITE>,
<CITE>Flex</CITE>, <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</CITE>, <CITE>Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>, <CITE>Make</CITE>, <CITE>Texinfo</CITE>, &#38; <CITE>Termcap</CITE>
manuals; six copies of the <CITE>GNU Emacs</CITE> manual; and a packet of ten
reference cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB.
<BR>   <BR>
Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs
that have sources of our software &#38; compiler tool
binaries for some systems.  The MS-DOS CD is in ISO 9660 format.  The other
CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</P>
<P>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"

<H1><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="bull20.html#TOC56">GNU Documentation</A></H1>

<P>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online &#38; printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how to
use all the features of each program, &#38; give examples of command use.  GNU
manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both typeset
hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online hypertext
display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals comes
with our software; here are the manuals that we publish as printed books.  See the
see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC64">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>,
to order them.

</P>
<P>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <EM>lay-flat</EM>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.  Currently, the <CITE>GDB</CITE>, <CITE>Emacs</CITE>, <CITE>Emacs Lisp
Reference</CITE>, <CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE>, <CITE>GAWK</CITE>,
<CITE>Make</CITE>, <CITE>Bison</CITE>, &#38; <CITE>Texinfo</CITE> manuals have this binding.  The
other GNU manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC or Wire--O
binding.  All our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the
8.5in by 11in <CITE>Calc</CITE> manual.

</P>
<P>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</P>

<P>
<CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE> (Edition 4.12 for Version 4.14) tells how to run
your program under GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a
program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>GNU Emacs Manual</CITE> (11th Edition for Version 19.29) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and
regular expression search; how to use special programming modes to write
languages like C<TT>++</TT> and TeX;
how to use the <CODE>tags</CODE> utility;
how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and
other elementary customizations.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</CITE> (Edition 1.04) is for
people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do want
to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you read it in
Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE> (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
and <CITE>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition</CITE> (Japanese DRAFT
Revision 1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
covers this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The GAWK Manual</CITE> (Edition 0.16 for Version 2.16) tells how to use the
GNU implementation of <CODE>awk</CODE>.  It is written for those who have never
used <CODE>awk</CODE> and describes the features of this powerful string and
record manipulation language.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Make Manual</CITE> (Edition 0.49 for Version 3.74) describes GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <EM>makefiles</EM>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Flex</CITE> manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <CODE>flex</CODE> program to create a
C<TT>++</TT> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</P>

<P>
The <CITE>Bison</CITE> manual (December 1993 Edition for Version 1.23) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE> (September 1994 Edition for Version 2.6)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<TT>++</TT>.  We are doing limited copier runs of this manual until
it becomes more stable.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Texinfo</CITE> manual (Edition 2.21 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation &#38; typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, &#38; how to catch mistakes.  This second edition
describes over 50 new commands.

</P>
<P>
<CITE>The Termcap Manual</CITE> (2nd Edition for Version 1.2), often
described as "twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap,"
details the format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal
capabilities, and the process of interrogating a terminal description.
This manual is primarily for programmers.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>C Library Reference Manual</CITE> (Edition 0.06 for Version 1.09)
describes the library's facilities, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" &#38; "system calls."  We are doing small copier runs
of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to
<CODE>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CITE>Emacs Calc Manual</CITE> (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

<H1><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="bull20.html#TOC57">How to Get GNU Software</A></H1>

<P>
All the software &#38; publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can also get GNU software directly from the FSF by ordering diskettes,
tapes, CD-ROMs, or Books with CD-ROMs.  Such orders provide most of the
funds for the FSF staff to develop more free software, so please support
our work by ordering from the FSF if you can.  See the
see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC64">Free Software Foundation Order Form</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software; they do not
work with us, but can provide our software in other forms.  Some are listed
in section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC13">Free Software Redistributors Donate</A>; also see section <A HREF="bull20.html#SEC59">Free Software for Microcomputers</A>.  Please note that the Free Software Foundation is
<EM>not</EM> affiliated with them in any way and is <EM>not</EM> responsible
for either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of their
responses.

</P>
<P>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partially on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</P>
<P>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of logins.  Please
use one of these other Internet sites that also provide GNU software via
FTP (program: <CODE>ftp</CODE>, user: <CODE>anonymous</CODE>,
password: <VAR>your e-mail address</VAR>, mode: <CODE>binary</CODE>).  If you have
FTP access but can't reach one of these hosts, you can get the software the
same way from GNU's main FTP host, <CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> (IP address:
<CODE>18.159.0.42</CODE>).  For more details &#38; additional hosts, get the
files <TT>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</TT> and
<TT>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'</TT> from any host.

</P>
<P>
Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE> to
lessen FTP traffic.  Refer to the <TT>`/pub/gnu/=README-about-.gz-files'</TT>
on each FTP site for instructions on uncompressing them.  <CODE>uncompress</CODE>

systems based on the Linux kernel are now available for Alpha &#38;
386/486/Pentium/Pentium Pro
machines with one of these buses: ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI.
Since these systems are essentially
variant GNU systems, we call them "GNU/Linux" systems.  An m68k port is in
testing (it runs on high end Amiga &#38; Atari computers).  PowerPC &#38; MIPS
