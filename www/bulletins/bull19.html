<h3 id="SEC4">What Is the FSF?</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" (pronounced "guh-new", "GNU's Not Unix") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</p>
<p>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have two specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and
distribute it to your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to
change a program as you wish, by having full access to source code.  You
can study the source and learn how such programs are written.  You may then
be able to port it, improve it, and share your changes with others.  If you
redistribute GNU software you may charge a distribution fee or give it
away, so long as you include the source code and the GPL; see section <a href="#SEC5">What Is Copyleft?</a>, for details.

</p>
<p>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</p>
<p>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</p>
<p>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President;
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman,
Harold Abelson, and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.

</p>
 

<h3 id="SEC5">What Is Copyleft?</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.
But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <em>all</em> users.  To prevent this,
<em>copyleft</em> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</p>
<p>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <em>GNU General Public License</em> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <em>GNU Library General
Public License</em> (LGPL), applies to a few GNU libraries.  This license
permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables under certain
conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU source code
distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available upon request.

</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each
license.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC6">What Is the Hurd?</h3>

<p>
The Hurd will be the foundation of the GNU system.  It is a collection of
server processes that run on top of Mach, a free message-passing kernel
developed at CMU.  Mach's virtual memory management facilities are also
used by the Hurd.  The GNU C Library will provide the Unix system call
interface, using the Hurd servers for those services it can't provide
itself.

</p>
<p>
One goal of the Hurd is to establish a framework for shared development and
maintenance.  The Hurd is like GNU Emacs in that it will allow users to
create and share useful projects without knowing much about the internal
workings of the system--projects that might never have been attempted
without freely available source, a well-designed interface, and a
multiple server design.

</p>

<p>
Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform
exists.  Right now we are using the University of Utah's Mach distribution
which we hope will be unified with the distribution produced by the Open
Software Foundation.

</p>
<p>
See section <a href="#SEC9">GNUs Flashes</a> for a report on recent progress.

</p>
<p>
We need volunteers for significant projects relating to the Hurd.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should please send mail
to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C
Library to new systems is another way to help development of the Hurd.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC7">GNU Utilities Safer!</h3>

<p>
Barton P. Miller &#38; his colleagues tested the reliability of Unix utility
programs in 1990 &#38; 1995.  Each time, GNU's utilities came out considerably
ahead.  They tested seven commercial Unix systems as well as GNU.  By
subjecting them to a random input stream, they could "crash (with core
dump) or hang (infinite loop) over 40% (in the worst case) of the basic
utility programs ..."
They found that the commercial Unix systems had a failure rate that ranged
from 15% -- 43%.  In contrast, the failure rate for GNU was only 7%.

</p>

<p>
For details, see the paper <cite>Fuzz Revisited: A Re-examination of
the Reliability of Unix Utilities and Services</cite> by Barton P. Miller,
David Koski, Cjin Pheow Lee, Vivekananda Maganty, Ravi Murthy,
Ajitkumar Natarajan, and Jeff Steidl, which is available on the World Wide Web
at URL:
<tt>`ftp://grilled.cs.wisc.edu/technical_papers/fuzz-revisited.ps.Z'</tt>.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC8">Conditions for Using Bison</h3>

<p>
As of Bison version 1.24, we have changed the distribution terms for
<code>yyparse</code> to permit using Bison's output in non-free programs.
Formerly, Bison parsers could be used only in programs that were free
software.

</p>
<p>
The other GNU tools, such as the GNU C compiler, have never had such a
requirement.  They could always be used for non-free software.  The reason
Bison was different was not due to a special policy decision; it resulted
from applying the usual General Public License to all of the Bison source
code.

</p>
<p>
The output of the Bison utility--a parser file--contains a verbatim copy
of a sizable piece of Bison: the code for the <code>yyparse</code> function.
(The actions from your grammar are inserted into <code>yyparse</code> at one
point, but the rest of the function is not changed.)  When we applied the
GPL terms to the code for <code>yyparse</code>, the effect was to restrict the
use of Bison output to free software.

</p>
<p>
We didn't change the terms because of sympathy for people who want to
make software proprietary.  <strong>Software should be free.</strong>  But we
concluded that limiting Bison's use to free software was doing little to
encourage people to make other software free.  So we decided to make the
practical conditions for using Bison match the practical conditions for
using the other GNU tools.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC9">GNUs Flashes</h3>


<ul>

<li><b>GNU Emacs 19.29</b>     (See section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Emacs 19.29 has just been released.  Its new features include support for
Windows NT, DEC Alphas, and Motif.

</li><li><b>New Programs and Manual on the Tapes</b>     (See section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Texinfo source for the manual <cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
Introduction</cite> is now on the Lisps/Emacs Tape.
GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>), <code>ncurses</code>, &#38; <code>ucblogo</code> are now on the
section <a href="#SEC25">Languages Tape</a>.
<code>cfengine</code>, GIT, <code>mkisofs</code>, <code>pine</code>, &#38; <code>saoimage</code> have
been added to the section <a href="#SEC27">Utilities Tape</a>.

</li><li><b>New Source Code CD!</b>     (See section <a href="#SEC38">June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM</a>)

We are releasing the Sixth Edition of our Source Code CD-ROM.  It includes
Emacs 19.29, and most of the new programs and changes on the tapes.

</li><li><b>FlexFAX</b>     (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Its author has renamed FlexFAX to HylaFAX due to a trademark conflict.

</li><li><b>Older FSF CD-ROMs Available at a Reduced Price</b>

While supplies last, older versions of our CD-ROMs are available at a
reduced price.
See the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
for ordering information.

</li><li><b>GNU Software Now Works on MS-DOS</b>     (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS for
i386, i486, &#38; Pentium machines.  We ship binaries &#38; sources on the
section <a href="#SEC42">DJGPP Diskettes</a>,
section <a href="#SEC43">Emacs Diskettes</a>,
section <a href="#SEC44">Selected Utilities Diskettes</a>,
the section <a href="#SEC34">December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>,
&#38; soon on the section <a href="#SEC35">MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li><b>Postscript Versions of GNU Manuals Available for FTP</b>

FTP host <code>phi.sinica.edu.tw</code> has Postscript files (for A4
paper) of GNU manuals in <tt>`/pub/aspac/gnu/'</tt>.  The FSF is not
responsible for these files.

</li><li><b>Hurd</b>     (Also see section <a href="#SEC6">What Is the Hurd?</a>)

The GNU Hurd now runs programs native.  We have implemented both shared
libraries using ELF, &#38; the popular <code>ext2</code> file system used by Linux.
It can run GCC, <code>make</code>, Emacs, &#38; most other GNU utilities.  Progress
is being made so rapidly that by the time you read this it probably does
much more.  It is right on the verge of being self-hosting (able to run on
its own well enough to compile its own source code, &#38; be used for its own
development).  We have much better device supportm &#38; some new utilities,
including a fancy <code>ps</code> &#38; <code>settrans</code>.

For a complete system we still have much more work to do, but we will make
an alpha release as soon as the network software is finished &#38; shared
libraries have been well tested.  We have a mailing list to
announce progress; to be added to it, ask
<code>hurd-announce-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>Mach 4: a new research version of Mach</b>

Complete source and binaries for two versions of the Mach 4 kernel and
related programs, part of an ongoing OS research project at the University
of Utah, are available by anonymous FTP in
<tt>`jaguar.cs.utah.edu:/flexmach'</tt>.

One version is essentially a reorganization of CMU's Mach 3 (MK83a) and
currently supports only the Intel x86 architecture.  Changes so far have
increased Mach's ease of use &#38; practicality in a PC environment.  These
include a much simpler GNU-style build environment; a new kernel boot
mechanism allowing booting using Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, or Mach boot
loaders; compatibility with Linux network device drivers (&#38; soon, Linux
SCSI drivers); some new device drivers; &#38; support for the "Lites"
BSD-based single-server.  There are pre-built binaries for the kernel,
Lites server, &#38; the compiler tools to build Mach 4 under Linux, NetBSD, or
FreeBSD.

The other version supports only the PA-RISC 1.1 (HP 700) platform.
It includes the new build environment, some early results of research on
improving Mach RPC, as well as complete HP 700 support.  It is
significantly less robust than the x86 version and should be considered an
"alpha snapshot" for hard-core OS hackers only.  The snapshot includes a
complete 4.4BSD--Lite based single-server execution environment consisting
of the Mach kernel, the "Lites" BSD-based single-server/emulator, a
complete GNU compiler tool chain for the ELF object format, and essential
4.4--Lite utilities.

Utah expects a major release by December 1995.  It will support both
platforms, add more research results in the VM &#38; RPC systems,
add a programmable class server/linker/loader (OMOS),
a powerful interface definition language compiler,
&#38; a portable distributed shared memory system.

<tt>`http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flexmach/'</tt> contains more
information on Mach 4 and related projects at the University of Utah, or
send mail to <code>mach4-users-request@cs.utah.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>The Dictionary Project</b>

The FSF has a copy of the unabridged <cite>Century Dictionary</cite>, now in the
public domain, and we are planning to put it online.  We tried OCR, but it
wasn't reliable enough.

The first group of dictionary volunteers have inputed some entries.
We are evaluating their work to see how best to proceed.

</li><li><b>Manuals Updated since Last Bulletin</b>     (Also see section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>)

These new editions includes bug fixes and additional information:
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite>,
<cite>Emacs Manual</cite>,
<cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>,
<cite>Texinfo Manual</cite>,
and
<cite>C Library Reference Manual</cite>.

</li><li><b>GNU Column in Linux Magazine</b>

Arnold Robbins, <code>arnold@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>, a long-time volunteer
for the GNU Project, writes "What's GNU?", a semi-regular
column in the monthly magazine <cite>Linux Journal</cite>.  The column discusses
the GNU Project, its software, and other interesting free software.  Authors
of significant GNU software packages occasionally write columns as guest
columnists.

</li><li><b>Source CD-ROM Subscriptions</b>

We offer a subscription service for the Source Code CD-ROM in addition to
our tape subscription service.  For the price of 3 CD-ROMs (plus any
shipping costs) you get the next 4 that we make.  We make between two and
four updates a year.  See section <a href="#SEC46">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</a>.

</li><li><b>The FSF Takes Credit Cards</b>

We take these credit cards: Carte Blanche, Diner's Club, Mastercard, JCB,
Visa, and American Express.  Please note that we are charged about 5% of an
order's total amount in credit card processing fees.  Please consider
paying by check instead or adding on a 5% donation to make up the
difference.

</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC10">Help from Free Software Companies</h3>

<p>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

</p>
<p>
Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) regularly donates a part of its
income to the FSF to support the development of new GNU programs.  Listing
them here is our way of thanking them.
Wingnut has made a pledge to donate 10% of their income to the FSF, and has
purchased several Deluxe Distribution packages in Japan.  Also see
section <a href="#SEC56">Cygnus Matches Donations!</a>.

<h3 id="SEC11">Free Software Redistributors Donate</h3>

<p>
The <b>Sun Users Group Deutschland</b> and <b>ASCII Corporation</b>
(Japan) have added donations to the FSF to the price of their next CD-ROM
of GNU software.  The producers of the <b>SNOW 2.1 CD</b> added the words
"Includes $5 donation to the FSF" to the front of their CD.  Potential
buyers will know precisely how much of the price is for the FSF and how
much is for the redistributor.

</p>
<p>
<b>Austin Code Works</b>, a redistributor of free software, is supporting
free software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling price for
the GNU software packages they produce and sell.
<b>Walnut</b> <b>Creek</b> <b>CDROM</b> and <b>Info</b> <b>Magic</b>,
two more free software redistributors, are also giving us a percentage of
their selling price.
<b>CQ Publishing</b> made a large donation from the sales of their book
about GAWK in Japanese.

</p>
<p>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.

</p>
<p>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</p>
<p>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</p>
<p>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated,"
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</p>
<p>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler contribute more; major new features and programs contribute the
most.

</p>
<p>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC12">Free Software Support</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our
mission is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way
to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers now do; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

</p>
<p>
The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support and other
consulting services.  It is in the file <tt>`etc/SERVICE'</tt> in the GNU Emacs

If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.  We have
many Internet mailing lists for bug reports, announcements, and questions.
They are also gatewayed into USENET news as the <code>gnu.*</code> newsgroups.
You can request a list of the mailing lists from either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part
of preparing a new improved version.  We may send you a patch for a bug so
that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug
report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from
another user who reads our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the
Service Directory.

</p>
<p>
Please do not ask us to help you install software or learn how to use
it--but do tell us how an installation script fails or where
documentation is unclear.

</p>
<p>
If you have no Internet access, you can get mail and USENET news via
UUCP.  Contact a local UUCP site or a commercial UUCP site such as:

</p>


<pre>
   <b>UUNET Communications Services</b>

   Electronic-Mail: <code>info@uunet.uu.net</code>
</pre>

<p>
A list of commercial UUCP and Internet service providers is posted
periodically to USENET in the newsgroup <code>news.announce.newusers</code> with
<tt>`Subject: How to become a USENET site'</tt>.  You can also get it via
anonymous FTP from the host <code>rtfm.mit.edu</code> in the file
<tt>`How_to_become_a_USENET_site'</tt>, in the directory
<tt>`/pub/usenet-by-group/news.announce.newusers'</tt>.

</p>
<p>
When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development or by writing free software
improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

<h3 id="SEC13">Postcards Only!</h3>

<p>
CyberWire Dispatch points out that the United States government is
continuing its efforts to ban messages that it cannot read.

</p>
<p>
Such messages use various methods of encryption.  These methods are
like a traditional paper envelope in that they prevent an unintended
person from reading the message.  But they are more effective in that
only the intended recipient can `open the envelope', that is, decrypt
the message and read it.  From the point of view of the United States
government, a ban on private encryption would turn letters into
postcards.

</p>
<p>
In a Congressional hearing on 11 May 1995, FBI Director Louis Freeh said,
"[W]e're in favor of strong encryption ... We just want to make sure
we have a trap door and key ...".

</p>
<p>
Freeh fears that crooks will use
unbreakable methods of encryption for their communications unless they are
banned; but if these methods are banned, he expects crooks will obligingly
use the readable, government-provided methods.

</p>
<p>
Those who oppose a ban and favor non-governmental encryption point out
that a ban will be ineffective against such crooks.  The encryption
software already exists and is readily available.  The law-abiding
will send messages that can be read by the government; smart crooks
will not.

</p>
<p>
As a practical matter, the FBI will have little choice but to focus on the
messages of law-abiding people who are carrying out actions that are
legal and patriotic, but unpopular.  This has happened in the past,
and there is no reason not to expect this to happen in the future.

</p>
<p>
If Freeh's hopes become law, non-governmental encryption will become
illegal.  In the past, the government has favored its `Clipper chip', but a
more likely future plan would be for the government to certify several
private companies to provide legal encryption, but only for messages that
people in the government (and people who bribe them) can read.

</p>
<p>
We urge you to write your Senators and Representatives in Congress opposing
this attack on Americans' Constitutional right "to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search and
seizures ...".

</p>


<h3 id="SEC14">Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund Appeal</h3>

<p>
Phil Zimmermann, who wrote the public-key encryption program known as
Pretty Good Privacy ("PGP") and released it on the Internet, is facing
prosecution for "exporting" it out of the United States.

</p>
<p>
There is a law prohibiting the export of encryption software from the
US.  Zimmermann did not do this, but the U.S. government hopes to
establish that posting an encryption program on a BBS
or on the Internet constitutes exporting it--in effect, stretching
export control into domestic censorship.

</p>
<p>
If the U.S. wins, that will have a chilling effect on the free
flow of information on the global network, as well as on everyone's
privacy from government snooping.

</p>
<p>
Estimates are that Zimmermann's defense will cost over $100,000--and
that doesn't even count lawyers' fees.  To help pay this, a legal
trust fund, the Philip Zimmermann Defense Fund (PZDF), has been
established.  Donations are accepted in any reliable form, check,
money order, or wire transfer, and in any currency, as well as by
credit card.

</p>
<p>
To send a check or money order by mail, make it payable, <em>not</em> to
Phil Zimmermann, but to "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account."
Mail the check or money order to the following address:

   Account #: 0113830
   Account Name: ``Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account''
</pre>

<p>
Meanwhile, the U.S. wants to prohibit the use of encryption which it
cannot break, as a "counterterrorist" measure (see section <a href="#SEC13">Postcards Only!</a>).
To protect your privacy, write your Senators and Representatives in
Congress now.

<h3 id="SEC15">What Is the LPF?</h3>

<p>
The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) aims to protect the freedom
to write software.  This freedom is threatened by "look-and-feel"
interface copyright lawsuits and by software patents.

</p>
<p>
The LPF is a grass-roots organization of professors, students, business
people, programmers, users, and even software companies dedicated to
bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League is not opposed to
the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on individual programs.
The LPF aims to reverse the recent changes made by judges in response to
special interests.

</p>
<p>
Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers, managers,
and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.

</p>
<p>
To join, please send a check and the following information:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

Your name and phone numbers (home, work, or both).

</li><li>

The address to use for League mailings, a few each year (please indicate
whether it is your home address or your work address).

</li><li>

The company you work for, and your position.

</li><li>

Your email address, so the League can contact you for political action.
(If you don't want to be contacted for this, please say so, but please
provide your email address anyway.)

</li><li>

Please mention anything about you which would enable your<br />
endorsement of the LPF to impress the public.

</li><li>

Please say whether you would like to help with LPF activities.

</li></ul>

<p>
<strong>The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation, and
is not concerned with the issue of free software.</strong>  The FSF supports the LPF
because, like any software developer smaller than IBM, it is endangered by
software patents, and interface copyrights.  You are in danger, too!  It
would be easy to ignore the problem until you or your employer is sued, but
it is more prudent to organize before that happens.

<h3 id="SEC16">News from the LPF</h3>

<p>
by Dean Anderson, President, League for Programming Freedom

</p>
<p>
Borland won its appeal of the Lotus suit!!  Lotus successfully sued Borland
for infringing on a copyright of its menu structure and may have stood to
gain $100 million dollars in a ruling issued in 1993.  This appeal
reversed that ruling.  Lotus has reportedly decided to file an appeal with
the Supreme Court.  The LPF is making arrangements to file a revised amicus
brief should the Supreme Court decide to hear the case.

</p>
<p>
This is outstanding news and a great victory for the LPF.  The arguments
and decision very closely match our position, and the amicus brief arranged
by the LPF was partly responsible for the outcome of the case.  If the
decision stands, it may spell the end of user interface copyrights.

</p>
<p>
The LPF is also happy to have received a <em>tremendous</em> amount
of support on the GIF issue.  This issue had the double benefit of
expressing disapproval of the Unisys patent, and gaining exposure and
publicity for the LPF.

</p>
<p>
Qualcomm recently settled some protracted patent litigation with
Interdigital over CDMA technology.  (CDMA is a technology for cellular
phones picked up by Sprint, AT&#38;T, etc.)  In 1993, Interdigital sued Qualcomm
and was countersued.  After 10 trial days went by, the parties settled.

</p>
<p>
Even though Qualcomm felt it was not infringing any patents, it paid
Interdigital $5.5 million for a blanket license because continuing with the
trial and inevitable appeal would be more expensive, even if they
eventually won.

</p>
<p>
Qualcomm just released its earnings report.  It wrote off a one-time charge
of $13 million to cover the entire case.  By simple subtraction, its
litigation costs were $7.5 million.  Interdigital's own legal and support
costs were reportedly $4.5 million.  That leaves $1 million for their
shareholders and $12 million in litigation costs for the two companies.
This is just another example of the excessive costs of software patents.

</p>
<p>
Things are beginning to heat up.  Keep writing letters!  Write the LPF,
your representatives, and others.  See our Web page at
<tt>`http://www.lpf.org/'</tt> for more info on how to help the LPF
(suggestions to: <code>webmasters@lpf.org</code>).

<p>
Mieko (<code>h-mieko@sra.co.jp</code>) and Nobuyuki Hikichi
(<code>hikichi@sra.co.jp</code>) continue to volunteer for the GNU
Project in Japan.  They translate each issue of this Bulletin into
Japanese and distribute it widely, along with their translation of the
GNU General Public License Version 2.  This translation of the GPL is
authorized by the FSF and is available by anonymous FTP from
<code>ftp.sra.co.jp</code> in <tt>`/pub/gnu/local-fix/GPL2-j'</tt>.
They are working on a formal translation of the GNU Library General
Public License.  They also solicit donations and offer GNU software
consulting.

</p>
<p>
<code>nepoch</code> (the Japanese version of Epoch) &#38; MULE are available &#38; widely
used in Japan.  MULE (the MULtilingual Enhancement of GNU Emacs) can handle
many character sets at once.  Its features are being merged into the
principal version of Emacs.  See section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>, for more details on MULE.
The FSF does not distribute <code>nepoch</code>, but MULE is available
(see section <a href="#SEC38">June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM</a> &#38; the section <a href="#SEC43">Emacs Diskettes</a>).  You

The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, ICOT, has released
the "ICOT Free Software (IFS)" distribution.  The famous Fifth Generation
Computing System project produced IFS, which includes 100 systems for
symbol processing, knowledge processing, problem solving, inference, &#38;
natural language processing.  Many of them are based on parallel logic
programming.  Nearly half of them run on Unix workstations.  The ICOT
research center closed in March 1995, but distribution &#38; maintenance of IFS
will continue. For details, contact <code>ifs@icot.or.jp</code>, or refer to
<tt>`http://www.icot.or.jp/'</tt>.

</p>
<p>
There is a mailing list in Japan to discuss both hardware &#38; software which
is under the GNU General Public License, providing information about making
your own computer system.  The main language of the list is Japanese.  If
you are interested in getting information or having discussions in English,
ask <code>mka@apricot.juice.or.jp</code> or
<code>ishiz@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp</code>.

</p>
<p>
Many groups in Japan now distribute GNU software.  They include JUG, a PC
user group; ASCII, a periodical and book publisher; the Fujitsu FM
Towns users group; and SRA's special GNU support group, called Wingnut, who
also purchased the first Deluxe package in Japan.  (Since then, there have
been several other purchases of the Deluxe package in Japan.)

<p>
It is easy to place an order directly with the FSF from Japan, thus funding
new software.  To get an FSF Order Form written in Japanese, ask
<code>japan-fsf-orders@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.
We encourage you to buy software on tapes or CDs:
for example, 140 CD-ROM orders at the
corporate rate allows the FSF to hire a programmer for a year to write more
free software.

<h3 id="SEC19">Help the GNU Translation Project</h3>

<p>
GNU is going international!  The GNU Translation Project will get
maintainers, translators, and users all together, so GNU will gradually
speak many native languages.

</p>
<p>
The GNU <code>gettext</code> tool set contains <em>everything</em> maintainers need
for internationalizing their packages for messages.  It has quite useful
tools for helping translators add messages for their native
language, once a package has been internationalized.

</p>
<p>
To achieve the GNU Translation Project, we need many interested people who
like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to
synergize with other translators speaking the same language.  If you'd like
to volunteer to <em>work</em> at translating messages, please send mail to
your translating team.

</p>
<p>
These teams exist, as of May 1995: Chinese (zh), Czech (cs), Danish (da),
Dutch (nl), Esperanto (eo), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Irish (ga), German
(de), Greek (el), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Indonesian (in), Norwegian
(no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Swedish
(sv), &#38; Turkish (tr).  Each team has its own mailing list, courtesy of Linux
International.  You may reach your translating team at the address
<samp>`<var>xx</var>@li.org'</samp>, replacing <var>xx</var> by the two-letter ISO 639 code
for your language.  Please note that language codes are <em>not</em> the same
as country codes.  When you become a member of the translating team for
your own language, you may subscribe to its list.  To subscribe, send a
message with the message body <samp>`subscribe'</samp> to the appropriate list.

</p>
<p>
Team members should be interested in <em>working</em> at translations or at
solving translational difficulties, rather than merely lurking around.  If
you want to start a new team, write
<code>gnu-translation@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

<h3 id="SEC20">GUILE</h3>

<p>
The GNU Project continues to build GUILE: GNUs' Ubiquitous Extension
Language.  We are building a library which programmers can use to make any
ordinary C program extensible.  We expect to use this library in many GNU
programs and hope to see wide use elsewhere.

</p>
<p>
We are basing GUILE on SCM, a version of Scheme written by Aubrey Jaffer
(see the JACAL item in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>).  The interpreter has been
repackaged as a C library.  GUILE currently includes, with various degrees
of completion, a Posix system-call interface, an SCSH-like library, a
module system, a Tk interface, and a byte-code interpreter.  Projects are
underway to build into GUILE support for Emacs Lisp and for a more C-like
language.

</p>
<p>
Since we want to encourage everyone to adopt a common interpreter, the
copyright terms for GUILE will permit the use of the library even in
proprietary programs.  Get snapshots of GUILE from
<tt>`ftp.cygnus.com:pub/lord'</tt>.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</h3>

<p>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</p>

<ul>

<li><b>GNU C Library</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.)

While there has not been a new release of our C library since the January
GNU's Bulletin, Roland has been doing lots of work on it, with a focus on
support for the Hurd (see section <a href="#SEC6">What Is the Hurd?</a>).  Version 1.10 is in the
works; it adds several new functions traditionally found in Unix systems and
some small new GNU extensions.  Ulrich Drepper has contributed to the
library a great deal in the last few months, by writing new floating-point
printing/reading functions that are perfectly accurate &#38; much faster than
the old code.  He has also written a whole set of internationalization
features including POSIX.2-compatible <code>locale</code> &#38; <code>localedef</code>
programs &#38; catalogs for displaying program messages in languages other than
English.  The library can now be built as a shared library for the Hurd &#38;
other systems using the ELF object file format.  Included is the run-time
loader <code>ld.so</code> which sets up the shared libraries when a program runs;
it works now on the Hurd and should be easy to port (using ELF) to
GNU/Linux, SVR4 &#38; Solaris 2.

</li><li><b>GNUStep</b>     (Also see item Objective-C Library

in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement over two years ago, there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, named GNUStep.  Work has begun on GNUStep using an existing
library written in Objective-C as a base.  Much work remains to be done to
bring this library close to the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should
contact <code>Paul_Kunz@slac.stanford.edu</code>.  Check
<tt>`http://fvkma.tu-graz.ac.at/gnustep/gnustep.html'</tt> for more
info.

</li><li><code>makeinfo</code> <b>and the World Wide Web</b>     (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

<code>makeinfo</code> is being modified to translate Texinfo source files into
HTML documents that can be displayed on the Internet's World Wide Web.

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Version 2.0 of GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was released in April '95.  It now
includes a graphical interface with the TK widget system.  All
documentation is now Texinfo-based, with built-in regexp matching
used to access the documentation.  A first pass at the Common Lisp
condition system is also included.  Work on installing the new compiler and
internals is underway, as well as a port to the DEC Alpha architecture.
Volunteers for parts of the move to the ANSI standard are most welcome;
contact <code>schelter@math.utexas.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Future versions of Emacs will provide: saving the undo history in a file,
so you can undo older changes in the history, support for both
variable-width fonts and wide character sets, and support for the world's major
languages.  Our long term plan is to move it in the direction of a WYSIWYG
word processor and make it easier for beginners to use.

</li><li><b>C Interpreter</b>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
task is partly finished.  GCC has generated byte code for all supported
languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
finish this work has begun. To make this work usable, we need to enhance
GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We also would like support for
compiling just a specified few functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>GCC</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

New front ends for GCC are being developed for Pascal and Chill.  See the
GNU Fortran and GNAT items in this article for news on those front ends.

</li><li><b>GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator</b>     <em>Not yet available from the FSF</em>

A front end for much of Ada 95 (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is available
via anonymous FTP from <code>cs.nyu.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/gnat'</tt>.  News about
GNAT is posted to the USENET newsgroup <code>comp.lang.ada</code>.

</li><li><b>GNU Fortran</b>     (For info on <code>f2c</code> &#38; GCC, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) front end is stable, but work is needed to
bring its overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the levels
the Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: writing
documentation; improving diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially
for large initialized data tables; implementing <code>INTEGER*2</code>,
<code>INTEGER*8</code>, and similar features; and arranging to build and install
<code>libf2c</code> automatically.  We don't know when these things will be done,
but hope some will be finished in the coming months.  You can speed
progress by working on them or by offering funding.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <code>g77</code>.  To subscribe,
ask <code>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  To contact the
developer of <code>g77</code> or get current status, write or finger
<code>fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>Ghostscript</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Ghostscript 3.0 will be distributed by the FSF soon.  It will implement
nearly the full Postscript Level 2 language except for LZW compression,
which can't be freely implemented because of software patents.
(Prohibitions on programming like this are what the League for Programming
Freedom is fighting.  See section <a href="#SEC15">What Is the LPF?</a>, for details.)

</li><li><code>gmp</code>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The GNU <code>mp</code> library, version 2.0, will have arbitrary multiple precision
floating point arithmetic, be more portable, and be up to 4 times
faster than previous versions.

</li><li><b>Oleo</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Volunteers are writing an Oleo manual and extensions to the Oleo interface.

</li><li><b>Smalltalk</b>     (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The next release, version 1.2, will use the GNU Autoconf
configuration.  It will have significant performance improvements &#38; memory
requirement reductions, more control over the memory allocation, ability to
use the Smalltalk interpreter as a subroutine (i.e., callable from C),
better X Window System interfaces, ability to represent and manipulate C
data structures in Smalltalk, conditional compilation facilities, large
integer support, a complete GUI-based class browsing system, better (more
complete/usable) TCP/IP interfaces, exception support, weak references, &#38;
finalization support.

</li></ul>

<h3 id="SEC22">GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All our software is available via
FTP; see section <a href="#SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</a>.  We also offer software on
various media and printed documentation:

</p>

<ul>
<li>section <a href="#SEC32">CD-ROMs</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC24">Tapes</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>, which includes manuals and reference cards.

</li></ul>

<p>
In these articles describing the contents of each medium, the version number
listed after each program name was current when we published this Bulletin.
When you order a distribution tape, diskette, or newer CD-ROM, some of the
programs may be newer and therefore the version number higher.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
for ordering information.

</p>
<p>
Some of the contents of our tape and FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our tapes and FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <code>compress</code>, we use another compression program,
<code>gzip</code>.  (Such prohibitions on software development are fought by the
League for Programming Freedom, see section <a href="#SEC15">What Is the LPF?</a>, for details.)

</p>
<p>
GNU <code>make</code> is on several of our tapes because some system vendors
supply no <code>make</code> utility at all and some native <code>make</code> programs
lack the <code>VPATH</code> feature essential for using the GNU configure system
to its full extent.  The GNU <code>make</code> sources have a shell script to
build <code>make</code> itself on such systems.

<b>Configuring GNU Software:</b>

</p>
<p>
We are using a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages in
order to compile them.  It uses the Autoconf program (see item
below, in this article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the
same alternatives for naming machine and system types.

</p>
<p>
When the GNU system is complete, it will be possible to configure and build
the entire system at once, eliminating the need to separately configure
each individual package.

</p>
<p>
You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.
Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

<b>[FSFman]</b> shows that we sell a manual for that package.
<b>[FSFrc]</b> shows we sell a reference card for that package.
To order them, see the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.
See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a> for more information on the manuals.  Source code
for each manual or reference card is included with each package.

</p>

<ul>

<li><code>acm</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>acm</code> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

</li><li><b>Autoconf</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <code>m4</code> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <code>m4</code> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

</li><li><b>BASH</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU's shell, BASH (<b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell), is compatible with the
Unix <code>sh</code> and offers many extensions found in <code>csh</code> and
<code>ksh</code>.  BASH has job control, <code>csh</code>-style command history,
command-line editing (with Emacs and <code>vi</code> modes built-in, and the
ability to rebind keys) via the <code>readline</code> library.  BASH conforms to the
POSIX 1003.2 shell specification.

</li><li><code>bc</code>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>bc</code> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <code>bc</code> follows the POSIX.2-1992
standard, with several extensions including multi-character variable names,
an <code>else</code> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <code>dc</code> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <code>bc</code> is not implemented as a <code>dc</code> preprocessor.

</li><li><b>BFD</b>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

The <b>B</b>inary <b>F</b>ile <b>D</b>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <code>ld</code> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with source for Texinfo documentation (not yet
published on paper).

Presently BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.

</li><li><b>Binutils</b>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

Binutils includes these programs:
<code>ar</code>,
<code>c<tt>++</tt>filt</code>,
<code>demangle</code>,
<code>gas</code>,
<code>gprof</code>,
<code>ld</code>,
<code>nlmconv</code>,
<code>nm</code>,
<code>objcopy</code>,
<code>objdump</code>,
<code>ranlib</code>,
<code>size</code>,
<code>strings</code>,
&#38;
<code>strip</code>.

Binutils Version 2 uses the BFD library.  GNU's linker <code>ld</code> emits
source-line numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols &#38;
undefined references, &#38; interprets a superset of AT&#38;T's Linker Command
Language, which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
<code>nlmconv</code> converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
<code>objdump</code> can disassemble code for a29k, ALPHA, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA,
i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS, SH, SPARC &#38; Z8000 CPUs, &#38; can display other
data (e.g., symbols &#38; relocations) from any file format read by BFD.

</li><li><b>Bison</b>     (BinCD,DjgpD,DosBC,LangT,SrcCD,VMSCmpT)<b>[FSFman,FSFrc]</b>

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<code>yacc</code>.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Bison Manual</cite>
and reference card are included.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

A recent policy change allows non-free programs to use Bison-generated
parsers. See section <a href="#SEC9">GNUs Flashes</a>.

</li><li><b>GNU C Library</b>     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD) <b>[FSFman]</b>

The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most of the
functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible with 4.4BSD and
includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

The C Library performs many functions of the Unix system calls in
the Hurd.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <code>malloc</code> which
wastes less memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU regular-expression
functions (<code>regex</code> and <code>rx</code>) now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2
standard.

GNU <code>stdio</code> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <code>fmemopen</code> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <code>printf</code> formats to use a C function you have written.  For
example, you can safely use format strings from user input to implement
a <code>printf</code>-like function for another programming language.
Extended <code>getopt</code> functions are already used to parse options,
including long options, in many GNU utilities.

The C Library runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2),
HP 9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation
(Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486 (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2 &#38;
SCO ODT 2.0), Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3) &#38; SGI (Irix 4).  Texinfo
source for the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> is included
(see section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>); the manual is now being updated.

</li><li><b>GNU C<tt>++</tt> Library</b>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU C<tt>++</tt> library (<b>libg<tt>++</tt></b>) contains an extensive collection of
C<tt>++</tt> <cite>forest</cite> classes, an IOStream library for input/output
routines, and support tools for use with G<tt>++</tt>.  Supported classes
include: Obstacks, multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex
numbers, arbitrary length Strings, BitSets, and BitStrings.

Version 2.6.2 includes the initial release of the libstdc<tt>++</tt> library.
This implements library facilities defined by the forthcoming
ANSI/ISO C++ standard, including the Standard Template Library.

</li><li><b>Calc</b>     (DosBC, LspEmcT, SrcCD) <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator &#38; mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
can use Calc just as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many
more features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
logarithmic, trigonometric &#38; financial functions; arbitrary precision;
complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
algebraic simplification; differentiation &#38; integration.  It outputs to
<code>gnuplot</code>, &#38; comes with source for a reference card &#38; a manual.
See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><code>cfengine</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>cfengine</code> is used for maintaining site-wide configuration of a
heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
functionality is similar to <code>rdist</code>, but also allows many more
operations to be performed automatically.

</li><li><b>GNU Chess</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

GNU Chess lets the computer play a full game of chess with you.  It runs on
most platforms &#38; has dumb terminal, "curses", &#38; X terminal interfaces
(based on the <code>xboard</code> program).

GNU Chess has many special features including the null move heuristic, a
hash table with aging, the history heuristic (another form of the earlier
killer heuristic), caching of static evaluations, &#38; a database which lets
it play the first several moves of the game quickly.

Recent improvements include better heuristics, faster evaluation, thinking
on opponent's time, a perfect King and Pawn vs King endgame routine,
Swedish &#38; German language support, support for more book formats, a
rudimentary Bobby Fischer clock, &#38; bug fixes.

It is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft, Chua Kong Sian, &#38; Tim Mann on
behalf of the FSF.

</li><li><b>CLISP</b>     (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
It mostly supports the Lisp described by <cite>Common LISP: The Language
(2nd edition)</cite> and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a foreign language
interface and, for some machines, a screen editor.  The user interface
language (English, German, French) is chooseable at run time.  Major
packages that run in CLISP include CLX &#38; Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB of
memory &#38; runs on many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2,
Atari ST, Amiga 500--4000, Acorn RISC PC) &#38; Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux,
Sun4, SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTstep &#38; others).

</li><li><b>GNU Common Lisp</b>     (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp.  It
used to be known as Kyoto Common Lisp.  It is very portable and extremely
efficient on a wide class of applications.  It compares favorably in
performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover and
symbolic algebra systems.  It supports the CLtL1 specification but is
moving towards the proposed ANSI definition.

GCL compiles to C and then uses the native optimizing C compilers (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args and one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args, returning one value, so GCL is
maximally efficient on such calls.  It has a conservative garbage collector
which allows great freedom for the C compiler to put Lisp values in
arbitrary registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted
code, with display of source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiling tools
(based on the C profiling tools) count function calls and the time spent in
each function.  CLX works with GCL.

There is now a built-in interface with the TK widget system.  It runs
in a separate process so that users may monitor progress on Lisp
computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
interface.

There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  PCL runs with GCL (see
PCL item later in this article).  See section <a href="#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for plans
regarding GCL or for recent developments.

GCL version 2.0 is released under the GNU Library General Public
License.

</li><li><code>cpio</code>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>cpio</code> is an alternative archive program with all the features of SVR4
<code>cpio</code>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite>
standard.  <code>mt</code>, a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
<code>cpio</code>.

</li><li><b>CVS</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

CVS, the Concurrent Version System, manages software revision &#38; release
control at a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group site.  It
works best with RCS versions 4 and above, but will parse older RCS formats
with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See Berliner, Brian, "CVS-II:
Parallelizing Software Development," <cite>Proceedings of the Winter 1990
USENIX Association Conference</cite>.  To find out how to get a copy, contact
<code>office@usenix.org</code>.

</li><li><b>DejaGnu</b>     (LangT, SrcCD)

DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all
tests.  The framework's flexibility &#38; consistency makes it easy to write
tests.
DejaGnu comes with <code>expect</code>, which runs scripts to conduct dialogs
with programs.

</li><li><b>Diffutils</b>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>diff</code> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
Diffutils package contains <code>diff</code>, <code>diff3</code>, <code>sdiff</code>, &#38;
<code>cmp</code>.
Recent improvements include more consistent handling of character sets and
a new <code>diff</code> option to do all input/output in binary; this is useful
on some non-Posix hosts.  Plans for the Diffutils package include support
for internationalization (e.g., error messages in Chinese) and for some
non-Unix PC environments.

</li><li><b>DJGPP</b>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC)

DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G<tt>++</tt> 2.6.0 (see "GCC" in this article)
to i386s running MS-DOS.  DJGPP also has a 32-bit
i386 DOS extender with symbolic debugger; development libraries; &#38; ports
of Bison, <code>flex</code>, GAS &#38; Binutils.  Full source code is provided.
It needs at least 5MB of hard disk space to install &#38; 512K
of RAM to use.
It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768),
XMS &#38; VDISK memory allocation,
<code>himem.sys</code>,
VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview &#38; 386MAX) &#38;
DPMI (e.g., Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM &#38; QDPMI).

Ask <code>djgpp-request@sun.soe.clarkson.edu</code> to join a DJGPP users
mailing list.

</li><li><code>dld</code>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>dld</code> is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your
program with the <code>dld</code> library allows you to dynamically load object
files into the running binary.  Currently supported are VAX (Ultrix), Sun 3
(SunOS 3.4 &#38; 4.0), SPARC (SunOS 4.0), Sequent Symmetry (Dynix) &#38; Atari ST.

</li><li><code>doschk</code>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

This program is intended as a utility to help software developers ensure
that their source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms with
14-character filenames and on MS-DOS with 8+3 character filenames.

</li><li><code>ecc</code>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>ecc</code> is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking program, which can
correct three byte errors in a block of 255 bytes and detect more severe
errors.  Contact <code>paulf@Stanford.EDU</code> for more information.

</li><li><code>ed</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

Ed is the standard text editor.

</li><li><b>Elib</b>     (DosBC, LspEmcT, SrcCD)

Elib is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>     <em>See section <a href="#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</a> for future plans.</em>

In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
customizable real-time display editor &#38; computing environment.  GNU Emacs
is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated
into the editor--for writing extensions &#38; provides an interface to the
X Window System.  It also runs on MS-DOS &#38; Windows NT.  In addition to
its powerful native command set, Emacs has extensions which emulate the
editors vi &#38; EDT (DEC's VMS editor).  Emacs has many other features which
make it a full computing support environment.  Source for
the <cite>GNU Emacs Manual</cite>,
&#38;

Other configurations supported by Emacs 18 should work with few changes in
Emacs 19; as users tell us more about their experiences with different
systems, we will augment the list.  Also see section <a href="#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</a>.

</li><li><code>es</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>es</code> is an extensible shell based on <code>rc</code> with first class
functions, lexical scope, exceptions and rich return values (i.e.,
functions can return values other than just numbers).  <code>es</code>'s
extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the shell's
built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.  Like <code>rc</code>,
it is great for both interactive use and for scripting, particularly since
its quoting rules are much less baroque than the C or Bourne shells.

</li><li><code>f2c</code>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<code>f2c</code> converts Fortran-77 source into C or C<tt>++</tt>, which can be
compiled with GCC or G<tt>++</tt>.  Get bug fixes by FTP from site
<code>netlib.att.com</code> or by email from
<code>netlib@research.att.com</code>.  See file
<tt>`/netlib/f2c/changes.Z'</tt> for a summary.  See section <a href="#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</a>,
for info about GNU Fortran.

</li><li><b>Fileutils</b>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

The fileutils work on files:
<code>chgrp</code>,
<code>chmod</code>,
<code>chown</code>,
<code>cp</code>,
<code>dd</code>,
<code>df</code>,
<code>dir</code>,
<code>du</code>,
<code>install</code>,
<code>ln</code>,
<code>ls</code>,
<code>mkdir</code>,
<code>mkfifo</code>,
<code>mknod</code>,
<code>mv</code>,
<code>mvdir</code>,
<code>rm</code>,
<code>rmdir</code>,
<code>sync</code>,
<code>touch</code>,
&#38;
<code>vdir</code>.

</li><li><b>Findutils</b>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>find</code> is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations on
them.  Also included are <code>xargs</code>, which apply a command to a list of
files, and <code>locate</code>, which scans a database for file names that match
a pattern.

</li><li><b>Finger</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger <em>server</em>
host and other hosts at that site configured as finger <em>clients</em>.  The
server host collects information about who is logged in to the clients.  To
finger a user at a GNU Finger site, a query to any of its client hosts gets
useful information.  GNU Finger supports many customization features,
including user output filters and site programmable output for special
target names.

</li><li><code>flex</code>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD) <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

<code>flex</code> is a replacement for the <code>lex</code> scanner generator.
<code>flex</code> was written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory

</li><li><b>GCC</b>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCmpT) <b>[FSFman]</b>

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports multiple languages; the source
file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.  The GNU C
Compiler distribution includes support for C, C<tt>++</tt> and Objective-C.
Support for Objective-C was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <code>object</code>).  As much as possible,
G<tt>++</tt> is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not
with <code>cfront</code> (AT&#38;T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

The GNU C Compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which
performs automatic register allocation, common sub-expression
elimination, invariant code motion from loops, induction variable
optimizations, constant propagation and copy propagation, delayed
popping of function call arguments, tail recursion elimination,
integration of inline functions and frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf
function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, a certain
amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE) between basic blocks
(though not all of the supported machine descriptions provide for
scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes to
instructions and many local optimizations that are automatically
deduced from the machine description.
Position-independent code is supported on the 68k, i386, i486, Pentium,
Hitachi Slt, Hitachi H8/300, Clipper, 88k, SPARC &#38; SPARClite.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <code>long long
int</code>).  It supports extended floating point (type <code>long double</code>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.

GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C, &#38; GNU C extensions (including:
nested functions support, nonlocal gotos, &#38; taking the address of a label).

GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs &#38; DWARF.

GCC generates code for many CPUs, including: a29k, Alpha, ARM, AT&#38;T
DSP1610, Convex cN, Clipper, Elxsi, Fujitsu Gmicro, H8/300, HP--PA (1.0 and
1.1) i370, i386, i486, Pentium, i860, i960, m68k, m68020, m68030, m68040,
m88k, MIL-STD-1750a, MIPS, ns32k, PDP-11, Pyramid, ROMP, RS6000, SH, SPARC,
SPARClite, VAX &#38; we32k.

Operating systems supported include: GNU/Linux, AIX, ACIS, AOS, BSD, Clix,
Ctix, DG/UX, Dynix, Genix, GNU, HP-UX, ISC, Irix, Luna, LynxOS, Mach,
Minix, NetBSD, NewsOS, OSF, OSF-Rose, RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2, SunOS 4,
SysV, Ultrix, Unos, VMS &#38; Windows/NT.

Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
easy as building a native compiler.

We no longer maintain version 1 of GCC, G<tt>++</tt>, or libg<tt>++</tt>.

Texinfo source for the <cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> manual,
is included with GCC.

</li><li><b>GDB</b>     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD) <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

GDB, the <b>G</b>NU <b>D</b>e<b>B</b>ugger, is a source-level debugger for C,
C<tt>++</tt>, &#38; Fortran.

GDB can debug both C and C++ programs, and will work with executables
produced by many different compilers; however, C++ debugging will have
some limitations if you do not use GCC.

GDB has a command line user interface; Emacs comes with a GDB mode, and
<code>xxgdb</code> provides an X interface (but it is not distributed or
maintained by the FSF; FTP it from <code>ftp.x.org</code> in directory
<tt>`/contrib/utilities'</tt>).

Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
(breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
has simulators for the
Zilog Z8001/2, Hitachi H8/300, H8/500, &#38; Super-H.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <em>targets</em> a platform
means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that
GDB can <em>host</em> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but
cannot necessarily debug native programs.  GDB can:


<ul>

<li><em>target</em> &#38; <em>host</em>:

Amiga 3000 (Amix),
DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
DECstation 3100 &#38; 5000 (Ultrix),

</li></ul>

GDB can use the symbol tables emitted by the vendor-supplied compilers of
most MIPS-based machines, including DEC.  (These tables are in a
format which almost nobody else uses.)  Source for the manual
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> and a reference card are included.
See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><code>gdbm</code>     (LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

<code>gdbm</code> is the GNU replacement for the traditional <code>dbm</code> and
<code>ndbm</code> libraries.  It implements a database using quick lookup by
hashing.  <code>gdbm</code> does not ordinarily make sparse files (unlike its
Unix and BSD counterparts).

</li><li><b>Ghostscript</b>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU release of Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript graphics
language (see section <a href="#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</a>, for future plans).

The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 2.6.2.  Features include the ability
to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript runs (X
Window System and Microsoft Windows), resulting in much better-looking
screen displays; improved text file printing (like <code>enscript</code>); a
utility to extract the text from a Postscript language document; a much more
reliable (and faster) Microsoft Windows implementation; support for
Microsoft C/C<tt>++</tt> 7.0; drivers for many new printers, including the
SPARCprinter, and for TIFF/F (fax) file format; many more Postscript Level
2 facilities, including most of the color space facilities (but not
patterns), and the ability to switch between Level 1 and Level 2
dynamically.  Version 2.6.2 adds a LaserJet 4 driver and several
important bug fixes to version 2.6.1.

Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language
by writing
directly to a printer, drawing on an X window or writing to a file for
later printing (or to a bitmap file that you can manipulate with other
graphics programs).

Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA or SuperVGA graphics (but please do
<em>not</em> ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use PCs).

</li><li><b>Ghostview</b>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

system browser, an ASCII/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer, and
other related utilities and shell scripts.  It can be used to
increase the speed and efficiency of many daily tasks, such as
copying and moving files and directories, invoking editors,
compressing and uncompressing files, creating and expanding archives,
compiling programs, sending mail, etc.  It looks nice, has colors (if
the standard ANSI color sequences are supported), and is user-friendly.

</li><li><code>gmp</code>     (LangT, SrcCD)

the paradigm of a central site or organization which receives problem
reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic mail.  Although it has
been used primarily as a software bug-tracking system so far, it is
sufficiently generalized so that it could be used for handling system
administration issues, project management, or any number of other
applications.

</li><li><code>gnuplot</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

<code>gnuplot</code> is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
expressions and data.  It plots both curves (2 dimensions) &#38; surfaces (3

the
<code>man</code>,
<code>ms</code>,
<code>mm</code> macros;
&#38; drivers for Postscript, TeX <code>dvi</code> format and typewriter-like
devices.  Groff's <code>mm</code> macro package is almost compatible with the DWB
<code>mm</code> macros with several extensions.  Also included is a modified
version of the Berkeley <code>me</code> macros and an enhanced version of the X11
<code>xditview</code> previewer.  Written in C<tt>++</tt>, these programs can be
compiled with GNU C<tt>++</tt> Version 2.5 or later.  A driver for the LaserJet
4 series of printers is currently in test.

Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed
are complete Texinfo documentation, a <code>grap</code> emulation (a <code>pic</code>
preprocessor for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar
to <code>pm</code> (see <cite>Computing Systems</cite>, Vol. 2, No. 2; ask
<code>office@usenix.org</code> how to get a copy), and an ASCII
output class for <code>pic</code> so that <code>pic</code> can be integrated with
Texinfo.  Questions and bug reports from users who have read the
documentation provided with groff can be sent to
<code>bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><code>gzip</code>     (DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, LspEmcT, SrcCD, UtilT)

reader.

</li><li><code>hp2xx</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>hp2xx</code> reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and raster
output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently supported vector
formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex RGIP, Metafont, and various
special TeX-related formats, and simplified HP-GL (line drawing only)
for imports.  Raster formats supported include IMG, PBM, PCX &#38; HP-PCL
(including Deskjet &#38; DJ5xxC support).  Previewers work under X11 (Unix),
OS/2 (PM &#38; full screen), MS-DOS (SVGA, VGA &#38; HGC).

</li><li><b>HylaFAX</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

</li><li><b>Scheme</b>     <em>For more information, see section <a href="#SEC28">Scheme Tape</a></em>   (SchmT)

</li><li><code>screen</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>screen</code> is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate
"screens" (ttys) on a single character-based terminal.  Each
virtual terminal emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ISO 6429 (ECMA 48,
ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 functions.  Arbitrary keyboard input translation
is also supported. <code>screen</code> sessions can be detached and resumed
later on a different terminal type.  Output in detached sessions is saved
for later viewing.

</li><li><code>sed</code>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

<code>sed</code> is a stream-oriented version of <code>ed</code>.  It comes with the
<code>rx</code> library.

</li><li><b>Sharutils</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>shar</code> makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services, while <code>unshar</code>
helps unpack these shell archives after reception.  <code>uuencode</code> prepares a
file for transmission over an electronic channel which ignores or otherwise
mangles the high order bit of bytes, while <code>uudecode</code> does the
converse transformation.

</li><li><b>Shellutils</b>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

They are:
<code>basename</code>,
<code>date</code>,
<code>dirname</code>,
<code>echo</code>,

<code>whoami</code>,
&#38;
<code>yes</code>.

</li><li><b>GNU Shogi</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
captured pieces can be returned into play.

GNU Shogi is a variant of GNU Chess; it implements the same features
&#38; similar heuristics.  As a new feature, sequences of
partial board patterns can be introduced to help the program play
toward specific opening patterns.  It has both character and X display
interfaces.

It is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

</li><li><b>Smalltalk</b>     <em>Also see section <a href="#SEC21">Forthcoming GNUs</a></em>   (LangT,SrcCD)

GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language system
written in highly portable C.  It has been ported to many Unix &#38; some
other platforms, including DOS (non-Unix ports are not available
from the FSF).  Features include a binary image save capability,
the ability to invoke user-written C code &#38; pass parameters to it, an
Emacs editing mode, a version of the X protocol invocable from Smalltalk,
optional byte-code compilation and/or execution tracing, &#38;
automatically loaded per-user initialization files.  It implements all of
the classes &#38; protocol in the book "Smalltalk-80: The
Language", except for the graphic user interface (GUI) related classes.

</li><li><b>Superopt</b>     (LangT, SrcCD)

Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for a
given function.  You provide a function as input, a CPU to generate code
for, and how many instructions you want.  Its use in GCC is
described in the <cite>ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92</cite> proceedings.
It supports: SPARC, m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM
RS/6000, AMD 29000, Intel 80x86, Pyramid, DEC Alpha &#38; HP--PA.

</li><li><code>tar</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

GNU <code>tar</code> includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives, and
special features that allow <code>tar</code> to be used for incremental and full
backups.  Unfortunately, GNU <code>tar</code> implements an early draft of the
POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite> standard which is different from the final
standard.  Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible
fashion is unfortunately not trivial.

</li><li><b>Termcap Library</b>     (SrcCD, UtilT) <b>[FSFman]</b>

The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for <tt>`libtermcap.a'</tt> on
any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap
entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is source for the
<cite>Termcap Manual</cite> in Texinfo format.  See section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</li><li><b>TeX</b>     (SrcCD)

TeX is a document formatting system that handles complicated
typesetting, including mathematics.  It is GNU's standard text formatter.

The University of Washington maintains &#38; supports a tape distribution of
TeX for Unix systems.  The core material is Karl Berry's <code>web2c</code>
TeX package. Sources are available via anonymous ftp; retrieval
instructions are in <tt>`pub/tex/unixtex.ftp'</tt> on <code>ftp.cs.umb.edu</code>.
If you receive any installation support from the University of Washington,
consider sending them a donation.

To order a full distribution written in <code>tar</code> on either a
1/4inch 4-track QIC-24 cartridge or a 4mm DAT cartridge, send

</li><li><b>Tile Forth</b>     (LangT, SrcCD)

Tile Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth--83 standard written
in C, allowing it to be easily ported to new systems
and extended with "any" C-function (graphics, windowing, etc).

Many Forth libraries with full documentation are available including
ones for top-down parsing, multi-threads, and object oriented
programming.

</li><li><code>time</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

used by a process.  On some systems it also reports memory usage, page
faults, et al.

</li><li><code>tput</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>tput</code> is a portable way for shell scripts to use special terminal
capabilities.  Our <code>tput</code> uses the Termcap database, instead of

<code>g</code> &#38; <code>v</code> (in all window &#38; packet sizes),
<code>G</code>,
<code>t</code>,
<code>e</code>,
Zmodem,
&#38;
two new bidirectional (<code>i</code> &#38; <code>j</code>) protocols.
With a BSD sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  With TLI
libraries, it can make TLI connections.  Source is included for a manual
(not yet published by the FSF).

</li><li><code>wdiff</code>     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

<code>wdiff</code> is a front-end to GNU <code>diff</code>.  It compares two files,
finding the words deleted or added to the first to make the
second.  It has many output formats and works well with terminals and pagers.
<code>wdiff</code> is very useful when two texts differ only by a few words and
paragraphs have been refilled.

</li><li><b>X11</b>     <em>For details, see section <a href="#SEC29">X11 Tapes</a></em>   (X11OptT, X11ReqT)

</li><li><code>Ygl</code>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<h4 id="SEC28">Scheme Tape</h4>

<p>
Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed
at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming and
to research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

</p>
<p>
This tape now has MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the
"Revised^4 Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
(MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source is included.
It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries that can be used to bootstrap it are available for:
HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700, &#38; 800 (running HP-UX 9.0),
NeXT (NeXT OS 2 or 3.2),
DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
IBM RS-6000 (AIX),
Sun-3 or Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1),
DECstation 3100/5100 (Ultrix 4.0),
Sony NeWS-3250 (NEWS OS 5.01),
&#38;
Intel i386 (MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or NT).
If your system is not on this list &#38; you don't enjoy the bootstrap
challenge, see "JACAL" in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC29">X11 Tapes</h4>

<p>
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 6 of the X Window System.
The first tape has all of the core software, documentation, &#38; some
contributed clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is
necessary for running X or GNU Emacs under X.  The second, "optional"
tape has contributed libraries &#38; toolkits, the Andrew User Interface
System, games, et al.

</p>
<p>
The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released for programs on
both tapes.  See section <a href="#SEC46">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</a>.

</p>
<p>
We will distribute X11R5 on tape until X11R6 is stable and on the
section <a href="#SEC40">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, while supplies last.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC30">Berkeley 4.4BSD--Lite Tape</h4>

<p>
The "4.4BSD--Lite" release is the last from the Computer Systems
Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley.  It has most of
the BSD software system, except for a few files that remain proprietary.
It is much more complete than the previous "Net2" release.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC31">VMS Emacs and VMS Compiler Tapes</h4>

<p>
We offer two VMS tapes.  One has just GNU Emacs 18.59 (none of the other
software on the section <a href="#SEC26">Lisps/Emacs Tape</a>, is included).  The other has GCC
2.3.3, Bison 1.19 (to compile GCC), GAS 1.38 (to assemble GCC's output), and
some library and include files (none of the other software on the
section <a href="#SEC25">Languages Tape</a>, is included).  We are not aware of a GDB port for
VMS.  Both VMS tapes have DEC VAX executables from which you can bootstrap,
as the DEC VMS C compiler cannot compile GCC.  We do not have executables
for DEC Alpha VMS systems.  Please do not ask us to devote effort to VMS
support, because it is peripheral to the GNU Project.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC32">CD-ROMs</h3>

<p>
We offer these CD-ROMs:

</p>

<ul>

<li>Several editions of our section <a href="#SEC37">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC34">December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC35">MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM</a>, expected in late fall, 1995.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC36">Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM</a>, expected in late fall, 1995.

</li></ul>

<p>
Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format &#38; can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it you can mount each
CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions (the MS-DOS CD-ROM is only in ISO
9660 format), &#38; it will look just like an ordinary Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated &#38; otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</p>
<p>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</p>
<h4 id="SEC33">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the June 1995
Source CD costs $240.  It costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out
of your own pocket.  The December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

</p>

<p>
 
<b>What do the individual and company prices mean?</b>

</p>
<p>
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</p>
<p>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the June 1995 Source CD-ROM, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROM, we charge just $60.
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.

</p>
<p>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</p>
<p>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
140 Source CDs at that price supports an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

</p>
<p>
 
<b>Why is there an individual price?</b>

</p>
<p>
In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

</p>
<p>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</p>
<p>
 
<b>Is there a maximum price?</b>

<p>
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will
accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a
tax-exempt public charity.

<h4 id="SEC34">December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We now have the second edition of the CD-ROM that has binaries for GNU
compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler.  This enables the
people who use these systems to compile GNU and other free software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.  You can also use these GNU tools to
compile your own C/C<tt>++</tt>/Objective-C programs.  The first edition of
this CD is available while supplies last at a reduced price; see the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

</p>

<p>
<b>These packages</b>:

</p>

<pre>
   * DJGPP 1.12.m2 from GCC 2.6.0
   * GCC/G<tt>++</tt>/Objective-C 2.6.2
   * GNU C Library 1.09
   * GDB 4.13
   * Binutils 2.5.2
   * Bison 1.22
   * Emacs 19.26 (MS-DOS only)
   * Flex 2.4.7
   * Make 3.72.1
   * libg<tt>++</tt> 2.6.1
</pre>

<p>
<b>On these platforms:</b>

</p>

<pre>
   * <code>i386-msdos</code>
   * <code>hppa1.1-hp-hpux9</code>
   * <code>sparc-sun-solaris2</code>
   * <code>sparc-sun-sunos4.1</code>
</pre>


<h4 id="SEC35">MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We hope to release our first Book describing GNU Software for MS-DOS in
late fall, 1995.
Contact either address on
the top menu
for more information then.

</p>
<p>
It will include a CD-ROM with all the sources &#38; binaries on the MS-DOS
Diskettes.  For version numbers &#38; some details, see section <a href="#SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC36">Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
We hope to release our first Book describing Debian GNU/Linux in
late fall, 1995.
A CD will be inside the book with sources for Debian GNU/Linux.

</p>
<p>
GNU/Linux is a complete operating system for i386, i486, &#38; Pentium
machines, available in both source code &#38; binary form.  It is a GNU/Linux
system--that is to say, a variant GNU system which uses Linux as the
kernel.  (All the systems now available that use the Linux kernel are
GNU/Linux systems.)

</p>
<p>
Debian is being developed by Ian Murdock and the Debian Association in
conjunction with the Free Software Foundation.  We are distributing it
as an interim measure until the GNU kernel (the Hurd) is ready for
users.

</p>
<p>
You can FTP Debian under <tt>`/pub/debian'</tt> from
<code>ftp.cps.cmich.edu</code>.  For details about Debian &#38; how to get
involved, see <tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/DEBIAN'</tt> on a GNU FTP host (section <a href="#SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</a>).

</p>

<h4 id="SEC37">Source Code CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:

</p>

<ul>

<li>section <a href="#SEC38">June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM</a>, the newest release.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC39">May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li><li>section <a href="#SEC40">November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM</a>.

</li></ul>

<p>
These &#38; other older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a
reduced price; see the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs also have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals
listed in section <a href="#SEC48">GNU Documentation</a>.

</p>
<p>
The VMS tapes' contents are <em>not</em> included.  Many programs that are
only on MS-DOS diskettes &#38; not on the tapes are also <em>not</em> included.
The MIT Scheme &#38; X11 Optional tapes' contents are <em>not</em> on the
November 1993, May 1994, or June 1995 Source CDs.  See section <a href="#SEC24">Tapes</a> &#38; section <a href="#SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</a>.

</p>

<p>
There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the section <a href="#SEC34">December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</h3>

<p>
The FSF distributes some of the GNU software ported to MS-DOS, on
3.5inch 1.44MB diskettes. These disks have both sources and
executables.

</p>


<h4 id="SEC42">DJGPP Diskettes</h4>

<p>
We offer DJGPP on 30 diskettes.  For further details, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.
The DJGPP diskettes contain the following:

</p>

<pre>
   * bc 1.03
   * Binutils 2.4
   * Bison 1.22
   * cpio 2.3
   * Diffutils 2.6
   * doschk 1.1
   * Fileutils 3.9
   * Findutils 3.8
   * flex 2.4.7
   * GAS 2.4
   * Gawk 2.15.5
   * GCC 2.6.0
   * GDB 4.12
   * Ghostscript 2.6.1
   * Groff 1.09
   * gzip 1.24
   * hello 1.3
   * indent 1.9
   * ispell 4.0
   * libg<tt>++</tt> 2.6.1
   * m4 1.2
   * Make 3.71
   * patch 2.1
   * sed 1.18
   * shellutils 1.9
   * Texinfo 3.1
   * texutils 1.9
   * wdiff 0.04
</pre>


<h4 id="SEC43">Emacs Diskettes</h4>

<p>
Two versions of GNU Emacs are included on the Emacs diskettes we
distribute: GNU Emacs version 19.28 handles 8-bit character sets; the
other, MULE version 2.1, handles 16-bit character sets including Kanji.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC44">Selected Utilities Diskettes</h4>

<p>
The GNUish MS-DOS Project ported GNU software to PC compatibles.  Though
GNUish is no longer active, users still ask for these ports done some years
ago.  We offer these ports on five diskettes.  To find out how to get them
on the Internet, you can FTP files <tt>`/pub/gnu/MicrosPorts/MSDOS*'</tt>
from a GNU FTP host (listed in section <a href="#SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</a>).  In general,
the ports run on 8086/80286--based 16-bit machines; an 80386 is not
required.  Some are necessarily missing features.

</p>
<p>
Included are:
<code>cpio</code>,
<code>diff</code>,
<code>find</code>,
<code>flex</code>,
<code>gdbm</code>,
<code>grep</code>,
<code>indent</code>,
<code>less</code>,
<code>m4</code>,
<code>make</code>,
<code>ptx</code>,
RCS,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>shar</code>,
<code>sort</code>,
&#38;
Texinfo.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC45">Windows Diskette</h4>

<p>
We offer GNU Chess and <code>gnuplot</code> for Microsoft Windows on a single
diskette.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC46">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</h3>

<p>
If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest GNU developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent
to three tapes or CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you
four new versions of the tape of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.
The tapes are sent each quarter; the CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued
(currently twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent.)

</p>
<p>
Regularly, we will send you a new version of a
Lisps/Emacs, Languages, Utilities, or X Window System (X11R6) Required tape,
or the Source CD-ROM.  The MIT Scheme and X Window System Optional
tapes are not changed often enough to warrant quarterly updates.  We do not
yet know if we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools
Binaries or our new Books with CD-ROM.

</p>
<p>
Since Emacs 19 is on the Lisps/Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a
subscription to either is an easy way to keep current with Emacs 19 as it
evolves.

</p>
<p>
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the
X Window System.  We update the X11R6 Required tape as fixes and patches
are issued throughout the year.  Each edition of the section <a href="#SEC37">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>, also has updated sources for the required part of the X Window
System.

</p>
<p>
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're
in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you must
add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "Unix and VMS Software" &#38;
"Shipping Instructions" on the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC47">The Deluxe Distribution</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source code, the
Deluxe Distribution includes a complete set of our printed manuals and
reference cards.

</p>
<p>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</p>
<p>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine close to us!  However, we
can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system -- porting is a separate matter (to commission a port,
consult the GNU Service Directory; details in section <a href="#SEC12">Free Software Support</a>).
Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an
unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for a common machine.
Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

</p>
<p>
We supply the software in one of these tape formats in Unix <code>tar</code>
format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -- QIC24,
Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridge,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in cartridge -- QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm cartridge, or
DAT 4mm cartridge.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</p>
<p>
The manuals included are one each of the <cite>Bison</cite>, <cite>Calc</cite>,
<cite>Gawk</cite>, <cite>GNU C Compiler</cite>, <cite>GNU C Library</cite>, <cite>GDB</cite>,
<cite>Flex</cite>, <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</cite>, <cite>Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction</cite>, <cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Texinfo</cite>, &#38; <cite>Termcap</cite>
manuals; six copies of the <cite>GNU Emacs</cite> manual; and a packet of ten
reference cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB.

</p>
<p>
Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs (including the MS-DOS &#38; Debian GNU/Linux Books with CD when
they are available) that have sources of our software &#38; compiler tool
binaries for some systems.  The MS-DOS CD is in ISO 9660 format.  The other
CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</p>
<p>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"

documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how to
use all the features of each program, &#38; give examples of command use.  GNU
manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both typeset
hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online hypertext
display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals comes
with our software; these are the manuals that we publish as printed books
as well.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>, to order them.

</p>
<p>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <em>lay-flat</em>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.  Currently, the <cite>GDB</cite>, <cite>Emacs</cite>, <cite>Emacs Lisp
Reference</cite>, <cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite>, <cite>GAWK</cite>,
<cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Bison</cite>, &#38; <cite>Texinfo</cite> manuals have this binding.  The
other GNU manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC or Wire--O
binding.  All our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the
8.5in by 11in <cite>Calc</cite> manual.

</p>
<p>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</p>

<p>
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> (Edition 4.12 for Version 4.14) tells how to use
the GNU Debugger, run your program under debugger control, examine and
alter data, modify a program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU
Emacs.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Manual</cite> (11th Edition for Version 19.29) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and
regular expression search; how to use special modes for programming in
languages like C<tt>++</tt> and TeX; how to use the <code>tags</code> utility; how
to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and other
elementary customizations.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite> (Edition 1.03) is for
people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do want
to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you read it in
Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
covers this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GAWK Manual</cite> (Edition 0.16 for Version 2.16) tells how to use the
GNU implementation of <code>awk</code>.  It is written for those who have never
used <code>awk</code> and describes the features of this powerful string and
record manipulation language.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Make Manual</cite> (Edition 0.46 for Version 3.72) describes GNU
<code>make</code>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <em>makefiles</em>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Flex Manual</cite> (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <code>flex</code> program to create a
C<tt>++</tt> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</p>

<p>
The <cite>Bison Manual</cite> (December 1993 Edition for Version 1.23) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> (September 1994 Edition for Version 2.6)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<tt>++</tt>.  We are doing limited copier runs of this manual until
it becomes more stable.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Texinfo Manual</cite> (Edition 2.21 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation &#38; typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, &#38; how to catch mistakes.  This second edition
describes over 50 new commands.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Termcap Manual</cite> (2nd Edition for Version 1.2), often described as
"twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details the
format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal capabilities,
and the process of interrogating a terminal description.  This manual is
primarily for programmers.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>C Library Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 0.06 for Version 1.09)
describes most of the facilities of the GNU C library, including both what
Unix calls "library functions" and "system calls."  We are doing
limited copier runs of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please
send corrections and improvements to
<code>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Calc Manual</cite> (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

<h3 id="SEC49">How to Get GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All the software &#38; publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can also get GNU software directly from the FSF by ordering diskettes,
tapes, CD-ROMs, or Books with CD-ROMs.  Such orders provide most of the
funds for the FSF staff to develop more free software, so please support
our work by ordering from the FSF if you can.  See the
see section <a href="#SEC57">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software; they do not
work with us, but can provide our software in other forms.  Some are listed
in section <a href="#SEC51">Free Software for Microcomputers</a>; also see section <a href="#SEC11">Free Software Redistributors Donate</a>.  Please note that the Free Software Foundation is
<em>not</em> affiliated with them in any way and is <em>not</em> responsible
for either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of their
responses.

</p>
<p>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partially on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</p>
<p>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of logins.  Please
use one of these other Internet sites that also provide GNU software via
FTP (program: <code>ftp</code>, user: <code>anonymous</code>,
password: <var>your e-mail address</var>, mode: <code>binary</code>).  If you have
FTP access but can't reach one of these hosts, you can get the software the
same way from GNU's main FTP host, <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code> (IP address:
<code>18.159.0.42</code>).  For more details &#38; additional hosts, get the
files <tt>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</tt> and
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'</tt>.

</p>
<p>
Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with <code>gzip</code> to
lessen FTP traffic.  Refer to the <tt>`/pub/gnu/=README-about-.gz-files'</tt>
on each FTP site for instructions on uncompressing them.  <code>uncompress</code>
and <code>unpack</code> <em>do not work</em>!

<h3 id="SEC51">Free Software for Microcomputers</h3>

<p>
We do not provide support for GNU software on most microcomputers because it is
peripheral to the GNU Project.  However, we are willing to publish
information about groups who do support and maintain them.  If you are
aware of any such efforts, please send the details, including postal
addresses, archive sites, and mailing lists, to either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
See section <a href="#SEC41">MS-DOS Diskettes</a> and section <a href="#SEC32">CD-ROMs</a>, for microcomputer software

<li><b>Linux</b>     (Also see section <a href="#SEC36">Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM</a>)

Linux (named after its main author, Linus Torvalds) is a GPLed kernel that
implements POSIX.1 functionality with SysV &#38; BSD extensions.  Complete
systems (essentially variant GNU systems) based on the Linux kernel are now
available for 386/486/Pentium machines with one of these buses: ISA, VLB,
EISA, PCI.  Since these systems are essentially variant GNU systems, we
call them "GNU/Linux" systems.  A m68k port is in testing (it runs on
high end Amiga &#38; Atari computers).  AlphaPC &#38; MIPS ports are being worked
on.  FTP it from
<code>tsx-11.mit.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/linux'</tt> (USA) &#38;

like to highlight organizations involved with free information exchanges,
software that uses the GNU General Public License and companies providing
free software support as a primary business.

</li><li>

Information about free software or developers of free software that we may
not know about.  Often, we only find out about interesting projects because
a user writes and asks us why we have not mentioned those projects!

</li><li>

Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU Project or GNU
software.  Send these to the address on
the top menu,
or send a citation
to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

If you use &#38; appreciate our software, please send a contribution.  One way
to help is to order a tape, diskette, CD-ROM, or Book with CD-ROM from us.
A business can make a larger contribution by ordering a section <a href="#SEC47">The Deluxe Distribution</a>.  This is especially helpful if you work for an organization
where the word "donation" is anathema.
Because of the value received, the full dollar amounts of such donations are
not tax deductible as charitable contributions; however, they may qualify
as a business expense.
