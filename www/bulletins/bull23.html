<h3 id="SEC5">What Is the FSF?</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We do this by promoting the development and use of free software.
Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated software
system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced "guh-noo") that
will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of this system are
already being used and distributed.

</p>
<p>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may
not pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have three specific
freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and
distribute it to your friends and co-workers; second, the freedom to change
a program as you wish, by having full access to source code; third, the
freedom to distribute a modified version and thus help build the community.
Free software means you can study the source and learn how such programs
are written; it means you can port it or improve it, and then share your
work with others.

</p>
<p>
If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a distribution fee or you
may give it away, so long as you include the source code and the <i>GNU
General Public License</i>; see section <a href="#SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</a>, for details.

</p>
<p>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

</p>
<p>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution
service.

</p>
<p>
The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President; <br />
Gerald J. Sussman
and Harold Abelson, Directors.

</p>
<h3 id="SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.
But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to <em>all</em> users.  To prevent this,
<em>copyleft</em> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and the freedoms become legally
inseparable.

</p>
<p>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <em>GNU General Public License</em> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <em>GNU Library General
Public License</em> (LGPL), applies to a few (but not most) GNU libraries.
This license permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables
under certain conditions.  The appropriate license is included in each GNU
source code distribution and in many manuals.  Printed copies are available
upon request.

</p>

<p>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each
license.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC7">What Is Linux?</h3>

<p>
Linux (named after its main author, Linus Torvalds) is a GPLed kernel that
implements POSIX.1 functionality with SysV &#38; BSD extensions.
GNU/Linux systems are now available for Alpha &#38;
386/486/Pentium/Pentium Pro
machines with one of these buses: ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI.
An m68k port is in
testing (it runs on high end Amiga &#38; Atari computers).
MIPS, PowerPC &#38; Sparc ports are being worked on.
FTP it from
<code>tsx-11.mit.edu</code> in <tt>`/pub/linux'</tt> (USA)
&#38;
from
<code>ftp.funet.fi</code> in <tt>`/pub/Linux'</tt> (Europe).

Ask <code>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</code> about mailing lists.  See USENET
newsgroups, e.g. <code>comp.os.linux.misc</code>, for news.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC8">What Is a GNU/Linux system?</h3>

<p>
by Richard M. Stallman

</p>
<p>
A GNU/Linux system is a system which is a combination of Linux and
GNU.

</p>
<p>
Linux is a kernel, compatible with the Unix kernel, written by Linus
Torvalds.
There are several different distributions available via FTP and CD-ROM.
None are distributed by the FSF at this time.

</p>
<p>
GNU is a Unix-like operating system.  We started the GNU Project in 1984
with the aim of bringing such a system into existence.  A Unix-like
operating system consists of many components; we had to obtain each of the
important components somehow.  The job was so large that many of the people
who sympathized with the goal were discouraged from attempting it, but we
decided we would reach the goal no matter how long it took.

</p>
<p>
We found some components already available as free software--for
example, the X Window System &#38; TeX.  Naturally we decided to use
them, since the job was big enough even with short cuts.  We got
other components by helping to convince their developers to free
them--for example, the Berkeley network utilities.
</p><p>
The rest of components, we had to write.  These include Emacs, the
GNU C &#38; C<tt>++</tt> compilers &#38; libraries, Bash, Ghostscript, Groff, &#38;
many others.

</p>
<p>
All of these various components--those we wrote, those we helped make
free, and those we found already available--together make up the GNU
system.

</p>
<p>
Until recently, users couldn't run <em>the</em> GNU system, because one part
(the kernel; see section <a href="#SEC9">What Is the Hurd?</a>) was not yet ready.  (We made
the first test release in August 1996.)  However, for a few years
now, it has been possible to put together the Linux kernel and the
almost-complete GNU system, resulting in a complete Unix-like free
operating system suitable for actual use.

</p>
<p>
While commonly referred to as "Linux systems", we prefer the term
"Linux-based GNU systems," or "GNU/Linux systems" for short, since
these systems are mostly the same as <em>the</em> GNU system.
This gives Linus credit for the kernel that he
wrote, while indicating that these systems <em>as a whole</em> are
variants of the GNU system.

</p>
<p>
We also occasionally use the term "GNU/Hurd system" to emphasize that
we mean a version of the GNU system which uses the Hurd rather than
Linux.

</p>
<p>
We think it is proper for the GNU Project to get credit for making the free
Unix-like system that it set out for a decade ago.  But there is a more
important reason for friends of GNU to use names like "Linux-based GNU
system" instead of "Linux system."  This is to help spread the GNU
Project's philosophical idea: that there is ethical importance in
freeing users to share software and cooperate in improving it; that free
software belongs to a community, and people who benefit from the
community should feel a moral obligation to help build the community
when they have a chance.

</p>
<p>
When users install a system which they call "Linux," they can easily miss
ever seeing the GNU idea--or feel that it only indirectly
touches on them and what they are doing.
And if the GNU idea is not widely known or not taken seriously,
it will not persuade as many people to write new free software.

</p>
<p>
A conference was held this year on the topic of developing "Linux
applications".
This conference was about using the GNU system,
but the conference announcement did not mention the word GNU.
Instead of encouraging users to write more free software,
it did just the opposite.
It included a panel entitled,
"Licenses and licensing--I don't want to give away my application!!!"
(The three `!' marks appeared in the announcement).

</p>
<p>
Of course, these conference organizers are entitled to state their
views.  But it would be harder for these views to gather support if
the conference attendees recognized the operating system under
discussion as a variant of the GNU system, and thought about these
views in contrast with the GNU philosophy.

</p>
<p>
So please help make people aware of this relationship--please use
"Linux-based GNU system" or "GNU/Linux" when you talk about a
system which is a combination of Linux and GNU.

</p>


<h3 id="SEC9">What Is the Hurd?</h3>

<p>
The Hurd is a collection of server processes that run on top of Mach, a
free message-passing microkernel developed at CMU.  The Hurd and Mach
together form the kernel of the GNU/Hurd operating system.  The GNU C Library
implements the Unix "system call" interface by sending messages to
Hurd servers as appropriate.
</p><p>
The Hurd allows users to create and share useful projects without
knowing much about the internal workings of the system--projects that might
never have been attempted without freely available source, a well-designed
interface, and a multiple server design.  The Hurd is thus like other
expandable GNU software, e.g. Emacs and GUILE.

</p>

<p>
Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, &#38; DEC Alpha-3000.  Contact us if
you want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd
&#38; GNU C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier
than porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform
exists.

</p>
<p>
We have made several test releases of the Hurd.
See section <a href="#SEC17">GNUs Flashes</a>, for recent progress.
</p><p>
We need help with significant Hurd-related projects.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should send mail
to <code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C
Library to new systems is another way to help.
</p><p>
You can obtain
test releases of
the Hurd
from a GNU FTP host (see section <a href="#SEC38">How to Get GNU Software</a>)
along with complete binaries for an i386 GNU system.  We will not be
distributing these on CD-ROM until they are more stable.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC10">Become a Patron of the FSF</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation wants to acknowledge its
supporters and contributors in a more visible fashion.
You can now become an "official" supporter of the FSF.
See section <a href="#SEC42">Thank GNUs</a>, for the names of people and organizations
who have done so.

</p>

<ul>
<li>

$100 makes you a Supporter of the FSF;
you get a listing of your name in GNU's Bulletin for a year.
</li><li>

$500 makes you a Contributor;
you get a listing and a Certificate.
</li><li>

$1000 makes you a Sustaining Contributor;
you get a listing, a Certificate, and a gift.
</li><li>

$5000 makes you a Patron;
you get all the "benefits" of a Sustaining Contributor
plus a special gift.
</li></ul>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization;
all contributions are tax deductible in the US.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC11">Free Software Redistributors Donate</h3>

<p>
The French redistributor <b>PACT</b> has agreed to donate $1.00 for
each GNU/Linux CD that they sell.
</p><p>
<b>Red Hat Software</b>
has agreed to
donate $1.00 to the FSF for every copy of Red Hat Archives sold.
They have also added a GNU logo to the back of that CD with
the words "Supports the Free Software Foundation".
</p><p>
The <b>SNOW 2.1 CD</b> producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to the
FSF" to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how
much of the price is for the FSF &#38; how much is for the redistributor.
</p><p>
The <b>Sun Users Group Deutschland</b>
has made it even clearer:
their CD says, "Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the FSF."
We thank them for their contribution to our efforts.
</p><p>
<b>Kyoto Micro Computer</b> of Japan
regularly gives us 10% of their GNU-related sales.
</p><p>
<b>Mr. Hiroshi</b>, <b>Mr. Kojima</b>,
and the other authors
of the <cite>Linux Primer</cite> in Japan
have donated money from the sales of their book.
</p><p>
<b>Infomagic</b> has continued to make sizable donations to the FSF.
</p><p>
At the request of author Arnold Robbins,
<b>Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc.</b>
continues to donate 3% of their gross revenues from selling
<cite>Effective AWK Programming</cite>.
We would also like to acknowledge the many <b>SSC authors</b> who
have donated their royalties and fees to the FSF.

</p>
<p>
In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity
to raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These
redistributors have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to
waste.
</p><p>
You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves
or by donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

</p>
<p>
The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect
this of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how
much they give to free software development.  Then you can show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

</p>
<p>
To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such
as, "We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold."
A vague commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated,"
doesn't give you a basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the
profits from this disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting
and unrelated business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit.

</p>
<p>
Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler or to Mach contribute more; major new features &#38; programs
contribute the most.

</p>
<p>
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources for making more free software.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC12">Help from Free Software Companies</h3>

<p>
When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering
how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development or by writing free
software improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your
decision partially on this factor, you can help encourage those who
profit from free software to contribute to its growth.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC14">Emacspeak</h3>

<p>
Emacspeak is a speech output extension to Emacs.
You listen instead of look.
It allows someone who cannot see to work well with a computer.

</p>
<p>
T. V. Raman, who created Emacspeak,
wrote it to use different voice personalities
for different types of text:
a WWW link sounds different from quoted text
which in turn sounds different from regular text.

</p>
<p>
Raman wrote:

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you take a tty driver and make it speak
(this is essentially what all PC screenreaders under DOS do),
all you get to hear is the contents of the display;
you're responsible for figuring out why it's there.

</p>
<p>
So, for instance,
when a calendar application lays out the calendar
to produce a well-formatted tabular display,
it looks nice;
but the blind user hears "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 3 4 5 6 ..."
or some such garbage;
believe me; I've used such an interface for the last five years.
So now you've got to figure out that for instance
27 April is a Thursday
by checking which screen column the figure "27" appears in.

</p>
<p>
Emacspeak has a completely different approach
to speech enabling Emacs apps
(which as you know are numerous).
Emacspeak looks at the program environment and data of the applications,
and speaks the information the way it should be spoken.
So in the case of the calendar,
you hear "Thursday, April 27, 1995".
</p></blockquote>

<p>
This means you do not need to look at a display
to read news or mail, browse the Web, use Calc, write code or a novel.

</p>
<p>
In addition to appropriately different voices,
Emacspeak provides non-speech auditory cues
so you don't lose track of what is going on.

</p>
<p>
Emacspeak is in

<h3 id="SEC15">Display Ghostscript Project</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation and Net Community
are seeking to raise $11,000
to fund the completion of Display Ghostscript--that is,
extending Ghostscript to support the Display Postscript features.
So far we have raised $5600, slightly over half of the target.

</p>
<p>
If you would like to contribute,
please send a donation to the Free Software Foundation
and state that it is meant for Display Ghostscript.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC16">Replacing Qt</h3>

<p>
The GNU Project is looking for volunteers to work on developing
a free compatible replacement for the Qt GUI toolkit.

</p>
<p>
Qt is not free software
because its distribution terms are too restrictive.
Users do not have the freedom to make changes,
or the freedom to release their changes
for the community to use--freedoms which are a crucial part
of the meaning of free software.
Even developing an application program which uses unmodified Qt carries,
in some cases, an unacceptable requirement--to notify the owners of Qt.

</p>
<p>
A secondary consequence of the restrictions on Qt is that
linking Qt together with code covered by the GNU GPL
violates the GNU GPL,
because the combined program is not free software.
(It makes no difference whether the linking is done statically or dynamically;
either way is creating a combined program which the GPL applies to.)

</p>
<p>
But Qt is available to run at no charge, and some developers of free
applications are starting to make their programs use it.

</p>
<p>
This a serious problem for developing completely free operating systems.
Qt cannot be included in a free operating system,
because any system which contains Qt is, by consequence,
no longer entirely free software.

</p>
<p>
If a free application needs Qt in order to run,
free operating systems cannot use that application either.
We would be legally permitted to use the application itself,
and the system could still be free--but
including the application without Qt won't be any use.

</p>
<p>
The only feasible way to make these applications run on free systems
is to develop a free substitute for Qt.  Hence this project.

</p>
<p>
To make the goal precise, the new GUI toolkit
needs to be mostly compatible with Qt in regard to API.
How compatible must it be?
Compatible enough that it is easy to make the free applications use it.
In other words, this library should be compatible enough
to do the job of making the applications run.

</p>
<p>
This new toolkit does not need to have each and every feature that Qt has.
It just needs to have the features that the free applications use
and cannot easily do without.

</p>
<p>
The screen appearance and behavior of the replacement package
do not necessarily have to be compatible with Qt.
If they are convenient and work well with
the applications that use the library,
that is good enough.

<li><b>Hurd Progress</b>   (Also see section <a href="#SEC9">What Is the Hurd?</a>)

We have made three test releases of the Hurd, the most recent being 0.2.
The Hurd is currently much more reliable than previously,
and various utilities and file system translators,
such as an FTP file system,
have been written that take advantage of the Hurd's unique design.

One way for people to help out is
to compile and run as much third-party free software as they can;
in this way we can find bugs and deficiencies with some rapidity.
Volunteers with a PC are therefore eagerly sought to
get the 0.2 release and
compile their favorite Unix programs and games.

Daily snapshots of the Hurd sources are now available
for those that want to see the latest (non-stable) version;
see the Hurd page on the FSF Web site,
<tt>`http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu'</tt>,
for more information.

</li><li><b>New Source Code CD!</b>   (see section <a href="#SEC34">July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs</a>)

We are currently releasing the July 1997 (Edition 10) Source Code CD-ROM.
Once again, it is a two disk set.
It includes several new packages:
<code>aegis</code>,
<code>cook</code>,
<code>guavac</code>,
<code>lesstif</code>,
<code>prcs</code>,
<code>rsync</code>,
<code>swarm</code>,
&#38;
<code>vera</code>.
On the CD-ROMs are full distributions of X11R6.3, Emacs,
GCC, and current versions of all other GNU Software.
See section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>, for more about these packages.

</li><li><b>New/Updated Manuals since Last Bulletin</b>   (see section <a href="#SEC37">GNU Documentation</a>)

Since the last bulletin, we have published several updated editions
of our manuals (note the price changes):
<cite>GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, revised for GNU Emacs version 20, now $30;
<cite>Texinfo Manual</cite>, for version 3.11 of Texinfo, now $25.
We hope to have the following available very soon:
<cite>GNU Tar Manual</cite>, first time in print,
freshly reorganized and rewritten, $20;
<cite>GNU Software for MS-Windows and MS-DOS</cite>, a book and CD-ROM set
with a variety of GNU software
compiled for MS-DOS and Windows 3.1/95/97/NT,
$35 ($140 for corporate orders).
Watch our Web site, <tt>`http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu'</tt>,
for announcements of these publications.

</li><li><b>Fonts freed</b>
<p>
A free commercial-quality set of the basic 35 Postscript Type 1 fonts
is now finally available.
The copyright holder of these fonts, URW++ Design and Development
Incorporated, has decided to release them under the GPL.
Each font includes <code>.pfb</code> (outlines), <code>.afm</code> (metrics),
and <code>.pfm</code> (Windows printer metrics) files.
The fonts are compatible with Adobe Type Manager
and with general Type 1 manipulation tools,
as well as with Ghostscript
and other Postscript language interpreters.
</p><p>
The fonts are available in <tt>`ghostscript-fonts-4.0.tar.gz'</tt>
on the usual FTP sites.
</p>
</li><li><b>DDD now works with LessTif</b>   (Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Release 2.1.1 of DDD, the Data Display Debugger,
now works with LessTif, a free Motif clone.

</li><li><b>Give to GNU the United Way!</b>

As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, the FSF is eligible to receive United
Way funds.  When donating to United Way, one can specify that all or part
of the donation be directed to the FSF.  On the donor form, check the
"Specific Requests" box and include the sentence, "Send my gift to the
Free Software Foundation, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110."
We especially appreciate the donations from Microsoft matching the United
Way donations of their employees.
Also see section <a href="#SEC43">Donations Translate Into Free Software</a>, and
section <a href="#SEC44">Cygnus Matches Donations!</a>.

</li><li><b>Tapes and MS-DOS Diskettes No Longer Available from the FSF</b>

We no longer offer tapes or MS-DOS diskettes due to very low demand.

</li><li><b>MS-DOS/MS-Windows Book and CD-ROM</b>

This CD-ROM brings ports of GNU software
to MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems.
Most major GNU packages have been ported,
including Emacs, GCC, BASH,
development tools such as GDB and Make,
as well as <code>gawk</code>,
fileutils, textutils, shellutils, diffutils, &#38; findutils.
Packages for desktop publishing such as Groff and TeX are also included.

Taken together, these programs present a coherent set of tools
that will make a typical MS-DOS/MS-Windows system much more powerful
for any computer-oriented task.

All of the programs include
complete on-line documentation
as well as
typeset and ready-to-print manuals.

A book that accompanies the CD-ROM
explains how to set up the host system
for using the software and reading the documentation.

</li><li><b>The FSF Takes Discover</b>

The Free Software Foundation now accepts the Discover card
for orders or donations.
We also accept the following:
Carte Blanche,
Diner's Club,
JCB,
MasterCard,
Visa,
and American Express.
Note that we are charged about 5% of an order's total amount
in credit card processing fees;
please consider paying by check instead
or adding on a 5% donation
to make up the difference.
We do <em>not</em> recommend that you send credit card numbers to us via
email, since we have no way of insuring that the information will remain
confidential.

</li><li><b>MULE Merge Complete</b>

MULE is the Multi-Lingual Emacs developed by Ken'ichi Handa at the
Electrotechnical Lab in Tsukuba, Japan.  This code has been merged
into Emacs and is included in Emacs 20.

</li><li><b>GPC, the GNU Pascal Compiler</b>

The GNU Pascal Compiler (GPC) is part of
the GNU compiler family, GNU CC or GCC.
It combines a Pascal front end
with the proven GNU compiler backend
for code generation and optimization.
Unlike utilities such as p2c,
this is a true compiler, not just a converter.

Version 2.0 of GPC corresponds to GCC version 2.7.2.1.

The purpose of the GNU Pascal project is
to produce a compiler which:

<ul>

<li>

combines the clarity of Pascal with powerful tools suitable for
real-life programming,

</li><li>

supports both the Pascal standard and the Extended Pascal standard
as defined by ISO, ANSI and IEEE.  (ISO 7185:1990, ISO/IEC
10206:1991, ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989)

</li><li>

supports other Pascal standards (UCSD Pascal, Borland Pascal,
Pascal-SC) in so far as this serves the goal of clarity and
usability,

</li><li>

can generate code for and run on any computer for which the GNU C
Compiler can generate code and run on.

</li></ul>

The current release (2.0) implements Standard Pascal (ISO 7185, level 0)
and a large subset of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) and Borland Pascal.

The upcoming release 2.1 features better conformance to the various
Pascal standards, and of course bug fixes.

A growing group of GPC enthusiasts contributes to the project with
code, bug reports or fixes.

<tt>`http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~gnu-pascal/'</tt>,

(development versions).

</li><li><b>GUILE</b>
<p>
GUILE 1.2 is released.
<b>G</b>NU's <b>U</b>biquitous <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>L</b>anguage for <b>E</b>xtension
is an SCM-based
library that can make any ordinary C program extensible.
(For SCM info, see "JACAL" in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.)
Nightly snapshots of the development sources are also available, in
<tt>`ftp://ftp.red-bean.com/pub/guile/guile-core-snap.tar.gz'</tt>.
</p><p>
Also being developed are SCSH-compatible system call &#38; Tk interfaces, a
module system, dynamic linking support, &#38; a byte-code interpreter.  Support
for Emacs Lisp &#38; a more C-like language is coming.
</p>
</li><li><b>A New FSF T-shirt!</b>

We have a new T-shirt design.
See section <a href="#SEC39">FSF T-shirt</a>, for the description.

</li><li><b>New free game</b>

In August 1995, the action game Abuse by Jonathan Clark
was released for the first time.
It wasn't free software then--but now, less than two years later,
the company Crack dot Com has rereleased it as free software.
Abuse was initially developed on Linux-based GNU systems,
and we've included it on our our source CD set.

Beyond providing the free software community with
a game that many people enjoy,
and code that could be useful for developing other free games,
this demonstrates an important fact about
the economic circumstances of computer game development:
most non-free games bring their profit in a very short period of time.
Therefore, a game company can turn a game into free software fairly soon,
with little hardship.

Let's hope that other game developers follow this example.

</li></ul>

<h3 id="SEC18">Help the Translation Project</h3>

<p>
GNU is going international!  The Translation Project gets
users, translators, &#38; maintainers together,
so free software will gradually get to speak many native languages.
As of April 1997,
we have internationalized 27 packages
into 16 languages, using 159 translation files;
the translation teams have 422 subscribed members.

</p>
<p>
To complete this Translation Project, we need many people who
like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to
synergize with other translators speaking the same language as part of
"translation teams".
</p><p>
If you want to start a new team, or want more information on existing teams
or other aspects of this project, write
<code>gnu-translation@iro.umontreal.ca</code>.  Also see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>,
for information about <code>gettext</code>, the tool the Translation
Project uses to help translators and programmers.

<p>
Mieko (<code>h-mieko@sra.co.jp</code>) and Nobuyuki Hikichi
(<code>hikichi@sra.co.jp</code>) continue to volunteer for the GNU Project
in Japan.  They translate each issue of this Bulletin into Japanese and
distribute it widely, along with the translation of Version 2 of the GNU
General Public License.  This translation of the GPL is authorized by the
FSF and is available by anonymous FTP from <code>ftp.sra.co.jp</code> in
<tt>`/pub/gnu/local-fix/GPL2-j'</tt>.  They are working on a formal
translation of the GNU Library General Public License.  They also solicit
donations and offer GNU software consulting.

<p>
<code>nepoch</code> (the Japanese version of Epoch) &#38; MULE are available and widely
used in Japan.  MULE (the MULtilingual Enhancement of GNU Emacs) can handle
many character sets at once.  Its features have been merged into the
principal version of Emacs.  See section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>, for more details on MULE.
The FSF does not distribute <code>nepoch</code>, but MULE is available on the
section <a href="#SEC34">July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs</a>.

The Research Institute for Advanced Information Technology (AITEC)
releases ICOT Free Software (IFS)
and other IFS related software to the public.
IFS, which pertains to the fields of
parallel processing &#38; knowledge processing,
was developed at ICOT in the Fifth Generation Computer Project
&#38; its Follow-on Project.
</p><p>
Besides IFS, AITEC recently released as free software
many software systems developed by numerous research groups
through AITEC's research funding program.
Through their Web pages, AITEC releases 20 major IFS programs,
80 other IFS programs,
and 22 programs developed through AITEC's FY 1996 research funding program.
AITEC will soon release new software systems developed in FY 1997.
</p><p>
As of the end of May 1997, over 5,300 people
have accessed AITEC's Web pages,
and almost 35,000 IFS files have been transferred
since their first release in 1992.

The ImageSearcher is an object-oriented program to search images by
specifying properties of the image itself, without relying on the
name or attributes of the file.  It searches focusing on typical color,
average luminance, nine colors, image extent, center spectra, etc.
It runs on VisualWorks 2.5.1 (Smalltalk).  As a
result of the "eMMa Project" research sponsored by IPA and SRA
(written by Atsushi Aoki), the source code and documentation are
distributed under the GPL as free software, and are
available via FTP from host
<code>ftp.sra.co.jp</code>
in the file

<h3 id="SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</h3>

<p>
Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found
in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.  Here is some news of future plans.

</p>

<ul>

<li><code>e-scape</code>

<code>e-scape</code> is a graphical Web browser currently in development.
We plan to support CSS1, PNG, tables, and frames.
XML support and client-side scripting will likely be added eventually.

</li><li><code>gnusql</code>

<code>gnusql</code> (formerly <code>gss</code>) is the GNU SQL Server,
a multiuser relational DBMS.
An alpha release is currently available.

</li><li><b>GNU Emacs</b>   (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

Future versions of Emacs will have support for
variable-width fonts and inclusion of graphics in a document.
Also, perhaps, the ability to save the undo history in a file
(which allows you to undo older changes in the history).
Our long term plan is to move it in the direction of
a WYSIWYG word processor &#38;
make it easier for beginners to use.

</li><li><b>GNUstep</b>   (Also see "Objective-C Library" in section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>.)

OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
announcement,
there has been much interest in a GNU
implementation, named GNUstep.  Work has begun on GNUstep, starting with a
library written in Objective-C.  Much remains to be done to bring this
library close to the OpenStep specifications.  Volunteers should contact
<code>mccallum@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>.
Also see <tt>`http://www.gnustep.org/'</tt>.

</li><li><code>recode</code>    (For current status, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The next <code>recode</code> release should give more flexible control over
encodings of charsets, offer MIME conversions, &#38; handle ISO-10646
(Unicode).  It will install a library &#38; support files to help work towards
internationalizing GNU.

</li><li><b>Teak</b>
<p>
Teak, the GNU desktop interface, is intended to enable users with
minimal computer experience to browse the file system, launch programs,
&#38; perform file manipulations.
Teak is still in the early stages of development,
but here are some of the features planned for
the first release:
view directories sorted by name, date, size, etc.,
or treat the directory as a field of icons
which the user may rearrange within the window;
drag-&#38;-drop (edit a file by
dragging it into an editor program's window, or print a file by
dropping it on a printer icon); &#38;
for easy access, you can place icons for frequently-used files or
programs directly on the background of your screen.
</p><p>
For the second release, volunteers have offered to enhance Teak to
browse FTP sites, tar files, etc.

We have designed Teak around GUILE,
which will simplify Teak, keep its
user interface flexible, &#38; allow easy interaction with other GNU
programs.

Teak's developer, Jim Blandy, also works on GUILE.
Jim has put aside Teak to concentrate on GUILE; after
enough progress has been made on GUILE,
he will be resuming his work on Teak.

Why do we call it Teak?
"Because Teak makes a mighty fine desktop."
</p>
</li><li><b>C Interpreter</b>

We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
task is partly finished.  GCC generates byte code for all supported
languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
finish this work has begun.  To make this work usable, we need to enhance
GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We would also like support for
compiling just a few selected functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should contact
<code>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>Fortran</b>   (For info on <code>f2c</code> &#38; GCC, see section <a href="#SEC22">GNU Software</a>)

The GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) front end is stable, but more work is needed
to bring its overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the
levels the Fortran community expects.  Tasks to be done include: improving
documentation and diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially for
large, densely initialized data tables; completing existing support for
<code>INTEGER*2</code>, <code>INTEGER*8</code>, and similar features; allowing
intrinsics in <code>PARAMETER</code> statements; and providing debug information
on <code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> variables.  We don't know when
these things will be done, but hope some will be finished in the coming
months.  You can speed progress by working on them or by offering funding.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <code>g77</code>.  To subscribe,
ask <code>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  To contact the
developer of <code>g77</code> or get current status, write or finger
<code>fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li><b>The Dictionary Project</b>
<p>
The FSF has a copy of the unabridged <cite>Century Dictionary</cite>, now in the
public domain, and we are planning to put it online.  We tried OCR, but it
wasn't reliable enough.
</p><p>
Russell Nelson is coordinating the project.  Volunteers have entered close
to fifty pages so far, but the project needs more help; to volunteer, send
mail to <code>dictionary@gnu.ai.mit.edu</code> or contact the FSF.
</p><p>
This project provides a way for people without programming skills or money
to contribute to the GNU Project.
</p>
</li></ul>


<h3 id="SEC21">Free Software Support</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our
mission is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way
to increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a
living providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much
as doctors and lawyers do now; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

</p>
<p>
The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support &#38; other
consulting services.  It is
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE'</tt> on a GNU FTP host
(see section <a href="#SEC38">How to Get GNU Software</a>),
on the World Wide Web
at URL <tt>`http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/service.html'</tt>,
in the file <tt>`etc/SERVICE'</tt> in the Emacs distribution,
&#38;
the file <tt>`SERVICE'</tt> in the GCC distribution.
Contact us to get it or to be listed in it.
Service providers who share their income with the FSF are listed in
section <a href="#SEC12">Help from Free Software Companies</a>.

</p>
<p>
If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.  We have
many Internet mailing lists for bug reports, announcements, &#38; questions.
They are also gatewayed into USENET news as our <code>gnu.*</code> newsgroups.
Both are listed in file
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/MAILINGLISTS'</tt> on a GNU FTP host
(see section <a href="#SEC38">How to Get GNU Software</a>),
in the file <tt>`etc/MAILINGLISTS'</tt> in the Emacs distribution,
at URL <tt>`http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/mailinglists.html'</tt>
or request it from either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part
of preparing a new improved version that helps all users.
We may send you a patch for a bug so
that you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug
report does not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from
another user on our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the
Service Directory.

</p>
<p>
Please do not ask us to help you install software or learn how to use
it--but do tell us how an installation script fails or where
documentation is unclear.

</p>
<p>
When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing
money to free software development or by writing free software
improvements themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC22">GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All our software is available via
FTP; see section <a href="#SEC38">How to Get GNU Software</a>.  We also offer
section <a href="#SEC27">CD-ROMs</a>, and printed
section <a href="#SEC37">GNU Documentation</a>,
which includes manuals and reference cards.
In the articles describing the contents of each medium, the version number
listed after each program name was current when we published this Bulletin.
When you order a newer CD-ROM, some of the programs may be newer and
therefore the version number higher.
See section <a href="#SEC45">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
for ordering information.

</p>
<p>
Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <code>compress</code>, we use another compression program,
<code>gzip</code>.

</p>
<p>
You may need to build GNU <code>make</code> before you build our other software.
Some vendors
supply no <code>make</code> utility at all and some native <code>make</code> programs
lack the <code>VPATH</code> feature essential for using the GNU configure system
to its full extent.  The GNU <code>make</code> sources have a shell script to
build <code>make</code> itself on such systems.

</p>
<p>
We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (see section <a href="#SEC21">Free Software Support</a>).

</p>

<h4 id="SEC23">Configuring GNU Software</h4>

<p>
We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software
packages in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below,
in this article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same
alternatives for naming machine and system types.
</p><p>
Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system
all at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package
separately.
</p><p>
You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.
Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC24">GNU Software Now Available</h4>

</li><li><code>acm</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>acm</code> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.
We are working on a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight
characteristics.

</li><li><b>aegis</b>   (SrcCD)

Aegis is a transaction-based
software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on
many changes to a program concurrently,
and Aegis coordinates integrating these changes
back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

</li><li><b>Apache</b>   <em>Also see</em> <tt>`http://www.apache.org/'</tt>   (SrcCD)

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a successor to the NCSA family of Web
servers.  It adds a significant amount of new functionality, has an extensive
API for modular enhancements, is extremely flexible without compromising speed,
and has an active development group and user community.

</li><li><b>Autoconf</b>   (SrcCD)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <code>m4</code> macro calls.  Autoconf
requires GNU <code>m4</code> to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
generates do not.

</li><li><b>Automake</b>   (SrcCD)

Automake is a tool for generating <tt>`Makefile.in'</tt> files
for use with Autoconf.
The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile standards.

</li><li><b>BASH</b>   (SrcCD)

GNU's shell, BASH (<b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell), is compatible with the
Unix <code>sh</code> and offers many extensions found in <code>csh</code> and
<code>ksh</code>.  BASH has job control, <code>csh</code>-style command history,
command-line editing (with Emacs and <code>vi</code> modes built-in), and the
ability to rebind keys via the <code>readline</code> library.  BASH conforms to the
POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

</li><li><b>bc</b>   (SrcCD)

<code>bc</code> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
numbers.  GNU <code>bc</code> follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992
standard with several extensions, including multi-character variable names,
an <code>else</code> statement, and full Boolean expressions.
The RPN calculator <code>dc</code> is now distributed as part of the same
package, but GNU <code>bc</code> is not implemented as a <code>dc</code> preprocessor.

</li><li><b>BFD</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)
<p>
The <b>B</b>inary <b>F</b>ile <b>D</b>escriptor library allows a program which
operates on object files (e.g., <code>ld</code> or GDB) to support many
different formats in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so
that only BFD needs to know the details of a particular format.  One result
is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF,
and ELF.  BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet
published on paper).
</p><p>
At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
packages that use it.
</p>
</li><li><b>Binutils</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

Binutils includes these programs:
<code>addr2line</code>,
<code>ar</code>,
<code>c<tt>++</tt>filt</code>,
<code>gas</code>,
<code>gprof</code>,
<code>ld</code>,
<code>nm</code>,
<code>objcopy</code>,
<code>objdump</code>,
<code>ranlib</code>,
<code>size</code>,
<code>strings</code>,
&#38;
<code>strip</code>.

Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, <code>gas</code>,
supports the a29k, Alpha, ARM, D10V, H8/300, H8/500,
HP-PA, i386, i960, M32R, m68k, m88k, MIPS, Matsushita 10200 and 10300,
NS32K, PowerPC, RS/6000, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and
attempts to be compatible
with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It can produce
mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility similar to
that in some other assemblers.
GNU's linker, <code>ld</code>, supports shared libraries on many systems,
emits source-line
numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined
references, and interprets a superset of AT&#38;T's Linker Command Language,
which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
<code>objdump</code> can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and
can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format
read by BFD.

</li><li><b>Bison</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<code>yacc</code>.  Texinfo source for the <cite>Bison Manual</cite>
and reference card are included.

</li><li><b>C Library</b> (<code>glibc</code>)   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman]</b>

The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the underlying
system permits), &#38; most of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.
It is nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2 specification which
guarantees upward compatibility with 4.4BSD &#38; many System V functions.

When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <code>malloc</code>
which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.

GNU <code>stdio</code> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help
writing internationalized programs &#38; the user can adopt the
environment the program runs in to conform with local
conventions.  Extended <code>getopt</code> functions are already used to
parse options, including long options, in many GNU utilities.  The
name lookup functions now are modularized which makes it easier to
select the service which is needed for the specific database &#38; the
document interface makes it easy to add new services.  Texinfo source
for the <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite> is included
(see section <a href="#SEC37">GNU Documentation</a>).

Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of
systems.  The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not been
updated since development on version 2.0 started, so today it
runs out of the box only on GNU/Hurd (all platforms GNU/Hurd
also runs on) &#38; GNU/Linux (ix86, Alpha, m68k, MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC;
work is in progress for ARM).
Other architectures will become available again
as soon as somebody does the port.

</li><li><b>C<tt>++</tt> Library</b> (<code>libg++</code>)   (BinCD, SrcCD)
<p>
The GNU C<tt>++</tt> library (traditionally called <code>libg++</code>) includes
libstdc<tt>++</tt>, which implements the library facilities defined by the
forthcoming ISO C<tt>++</tt> standard.  This includes strings, iostream,
and various container classes.  All of this is templatized.
</p><p>
The package also contains the older libg<tt>++</tt> library
for backward compatibility,
but new programs should avoid using it.
</p>
</li><li><b>Calc</b>   (SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
desk calculator &#38; mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
can use Calc as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many
more features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
logarithmic, trigonometric, &#38; financial functions; arbitrary precision;
complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
algebraic simplification; &#38; differentiation &#38; integration.
It outputs to <code>gnuplot</code>, &#38;
comes with source for a manual &#38; reference card
(see section <a href="#SEC37">GNU Documentation</a>).

</li><li><code>cfengine</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>cfengine</code> is used to maintain site-wide configuration of a
heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
appearance is similar to <code>rdist</code>, but allows many more operations
to be performed automatically.

<p>
GNU Chess enables you to play a game of chess with a computer instead
of a person.
It is useful to practice with when there are significant
spare cpu cycles and a real person is unavailable.
</p><p>
The program offers a plain terminal interface, one using curses,
and a reasonable X Windows interface <code>xboard</code>.  Best results
are obtained by compiling with GNU C.

</li><li><b>CLISP</b>   (SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible &#38; Michael Stoll.
It mostly supports the Lisp described by <cite>Common LISP: The Language
(2nd edition)</cite> &#38; the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS &#38; a foreign language
interface.  The user interface language (English, German, French) can be
chosen at run time.  An X11 API is available through CLX &#38; Garnet.
CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory &#38; runs on all kinds of Unix systems &#38;
on many microcomputers (including
MS-DOS systems, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga 500--4000,
&#38; Acorn RISC PC).
See also item "Common Lisp",
which describes GCL, a complete Common Lisp implementation with compiler.

</li><li><b>CLX</b>   (SrcCD)

CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.
This is separate from the built-in TK interface.

</li><li><b>Common Lisp</b> (<code>gcl</code>)   (SrcCD)
<p>
GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
&#38; interpreter for Common Lisp.
GCL is very portable &#38; extremely
efficient on a wide class of applications, &#38; compares favorably in
performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover &#38;
symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.
</p><p>
GCL compiles to C &#38; then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args &#38; one value turns into a C
function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in
registers.  It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted
code &#38; displays source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler
(based on the C profiling tools) counts function calls &#38; the time spent in
each function.
</p><p>
There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs
in a separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp
computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
interface.
</p><p>
There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
does PCL (see
"PCL" later in this article).
</p><p>
GCL version 2.2.2 is released under the GNU Library General Public
License.

</li><li><b>cook</b>   (SrcCD)

Cook is a tool for constructing files,
and maintaining referential integrity between files.
It is given a set of files to create,
and recipes of how to create and maintain them.
In any non-trivial program there will be prerequisites
to performing the actions necessary to creating any file,
such as include files.
The <code>cook</code> program provides a mechanism to define these.

Some features which distinguish Cook include
a strong procedural description language,
and fingerprints to supplement file modification time stamps.
There is also a <code>make2cook</code> utility included to ease transition.

</li><li><code>cpio</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>cpio</code> is an archive program with all the features of SVR4
<code>cpio</code>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <cite>ustar</cite>
standard.  <code>mt</code>, a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with
<code>cpio</code>.

</li><li><b>CVS</b>   (SrcCD)

CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows you to
keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who,
when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles multiple developers,
multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations,
and can work over a wide area network.  It does not handle build
management or bug-tracking; these are handled by <code>make</code> and GNATS,
respectively.

</li><li><code>cxref</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>cxref</code> is a program that will
produce documentation (in LaTeX or HTML)
including cross-references
from C program source code.
It has been designed to work with ANSI C, incorporating K&#38;R,
and most popular GNU extensions.
The documentation for the subject program
is produced from comments in the code
that are appropriately formatted.
The cross referencing comes from the code itself
and requires no extra work.

</li><li><b>DDD</b>   (SrcCD)

</li><li><code>es</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>es</code> is an extensible shell (based on <code>rc</code>) with first-class
functions, lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e.,
functions can return values other than just numbers).  <code>es</code>'s
extensibility comes from the ability to modify and extend the shell's
built-in services, such as path searching and redirection.  Like <code>rc</code>,
it is great for both interactive use and scripting, particularly since
its quoting rules are much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

</li><li><b>Exim</b>   (SrcCD)

Exim is a new Internet mail transfer agent, similar in style to Smail 3.
It can handle relatively high volume mail systems, header rewriting,

(Also see "GNAT" later in this article for Ada language supports.)
Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed to
run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC.
(This does not include
any Objective-C classes aside from <code>object</code>, but see "GNUstep" in

GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs many
optimizations.
They include:
automatic register
allocation, common sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain
amount of CSE between basic blocks -- though not all the supported machine
descriptions provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion
from loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
elimination, integration of inline functions &#38; frame pointer elimination,
instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf function
optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, the ability to assign
attributes to instructions, &#38; many local optimizations automatically deduced
from the machine description.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <code>long long
int</code>).  It supports extended floating point (type <code>long double</code>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional
C, &#38; GNU C extensions (including: nested functions support, nonlocal gotos,
&#38; taking the address of a label).
</p><p>
GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, &#38; DWARF.

</li><li><b>GDB</b>   (BinCD, SrcCD)   <b>[FSFman, FSFrc]</b>
<p>
GDB, the <b>G</b>NU <b>D</b>e<b>B</b>ugger, is a source-level debugger for C,
C<tt>++</tt>, &#38; Fortran.  It provides partial support for Modula-2 &#38; Chill.
</p><p>
GDB can debug both C &#38; C<tt>++</tt>, &#38; will work with executables
made by many different compilers; but, C<tt>++</tt> debugging will have
some limitations if you do not use GCC.

GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
interface.  Two X interfaces (not distributed or maintained by the FSF)
are: <code>gdbtk</code> (FTP it from <code>ftp.cygnus.com</code> in directory
<tt>`/pub/gdb'</tt>); and <code>xxgdb</code> (FTP it from <code>ftp.x.org</code> in
directory <tt>`/contrib/utilities'</tt>).

Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
(breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which
includes simulators for the
ARM,
Hitachi H8/300,
Hitachi SH,
&#38;
PowerPC.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <em>targets</em> a platform
means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB can
<em>host</em> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
necessarily debug native programs.

Like CVS, PRCS uses RCS to accomplish this task,
but this is inconsequential to the user,
as RCS is completely hidden beneath a layer of abstraction.

</li><li><code>ptx</code>   (SrcCD)
<p>
GNU <code>ptx</code> is our version of the traditional permuted index
generator.  It handles multiple input files at once, has TeX
compatible output, &#38; outputs readable <em>KWIC</em> (KeyWords In Context)
indexes without using <code>nroff</code>.
Plans are to merge this package into <code>textutils</code>.
</p><p>

</p>
</li><li><code>rc</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>rc</code> is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than
<code>csh</code>) and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.
It's intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
scripts.  It inspired the shell <code>es</code>.

</li><li><b>RCS</b>   (SrcCD)

RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &#38; management
of software projects.  Used with GNU <code>diff</code>, RCS can handle binary
files (8-bit data, executables, object files, etc).
RCS now conforms to GNU configuration standards &#38; to POSIX 1003.1b-1993.
Also see the CVS item above.

</li><li><code>readline</code>   (BinCD, SrcCD)

Brian Fox wrote the <code>readline</code> library one weekend in 1987,
so that the FSF would have a clean Emacs-like line editing facility
that could be used across multiple programs.
After installing it in Bash,
he went on to test the reusability of the code
by adding it to GDB,
and then later, to the GNU FTP client.
The library supplies many entry points--the simplest interface
gives any program the ability to store a history of input lines,
and gives the end user a complete
Emacs-like (or vi-like) editing capability over the input,
simply by replacing calls to <code>gets</code> with calls to <code>readline</code>.

</li><li><code>recode</code>   <em>Also see section <a href="#SEC20">Forthcoming GNUs</a></em>   (SrcCD)

GNU <code>recode</code> converts files between character sets and usages.  When
exact transliterations are not possible, it may delete the offending
characters or fall back on approximations.  This program recognizes or
outputs nearly 150 different character sets and is able to transliterate
files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character sets are supported.

</li><li><code>regex</code>   (SrcCD)

The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU programs which
do regular expression matching &#38; is available separately.  An alternate

</li><li><code>rsync</code>   (SrcCD)

<code>rsync</code> is a replacement for <code>rcp</code> that has many more features.
<code>rsync</code> uses the "rsync algorithm",
which provides a very fast method
for synchronizing large remote files,
sending only the differences across the link.
It does not require both versions of a file
to be local in order to compute the differences.
A technical report describing the rsync algorithm
is included with the package.

</li><li><code>rx</code>   (SrcCD)

Tom Lord has written <code>rx</code>, a new regular expression library which is
generally faster and more correct than the older GNU <code>regex</code> library.

<h3 id="SEC26">The Deluxe Distribution</h3>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code
and includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, &#38; reference
cards.

</p>
<p>
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds
of different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C<tt>++</tt> Compiler, the GNU
Debugger, the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

</p>
<p>
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating
systems.  We may be able to send someone to your office to do the
compilation, if we can't find a suitable machine here.  However, we
can only compile the programs that already support your chosen
machine/system--porting is a separate matter.  (To commission a port,
see the GNU Service Directory; details in section <a href="#SEC21">Free Software Support</a>.)
Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an
unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for a common machine.
Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

</p>
<p>
We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with
"Rock Ridge" extensions),
or on one of these tapes in Unix <code>tar</code> format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel,
Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge -- QIC24,
IBM RS/6000 1/4in c.t. -- QIC 150,
Exabyte 8mm c.t., or
DAT 4mm c.t.
If your computer cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we
can handle your format.

</p>
<p>
The manuals included are one each of <cite>Bison</cite>, <cite>Calc</cite>,
<cite>Gawk</cite>, <cite>GCC</cite>, <cite>GNU C Library</cite>, <cite>GDB</cite>,
<cite>Flex</cite>, <cite>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference</cite>, <cite>Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction</cite>, <cite>Make</cite>, <cite>Texinfo</cite>, &#38; <cite>Termcap</cite>
manuals; six copies of the <cite>GNU Emacs</cite> manual; and ten reference cards
each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, &#38; GDB.
</p><p>
Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of
our CD-ROMs
that have sources of our software &#38; compiler tool
binaries for some systems.
The
CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

</p>
<p>
The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more
free software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution"
section on
section <a href="#SEC45">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,

<h3 id="SEC27">CD-ROMs</h3>

<p>
We offer the section <a href="#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>, and
section <a href="#SEC32">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>,
each of which is available as either
the latest version at full price,
or (while supplies last) an older copy at a reduced price.

</p>
<p>
Our CDs are in ISO 9660 format &#38; can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each
CD with "Rock Ridge" extensions
&#38; it will look like a regular Unix file system, rather
than one full of truncated &#38; otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO
9660.

</p>
<p>
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

</p>

<h4 id="SEC28">Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs</h4>

<p>
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the July 1997 Source CD
set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out of
your own pocket.  The January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs
$220 for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

</p>

<h5 id="SEC29">What Do the Different Prices Mean?</h5>

<p>
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

</p>
<p>
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the July 1997 Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.
This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.

</p>
<p>
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company; so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for it.  We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor
system--so please cooperate.

</p>
<p>
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
150 Source CDs at that price support an FSF
programmer or tech writer for a year.

</p>
<h5 id="SEC30">Why Is There an Individual Price?</h5>

<p>
In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly and decrease the software development we can do.

</p>
<p>
However, for individuals, $240 is
too high a price;
hardly anyone could afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to
individuals at the lower price of $60.

</p>
<h5 id="SEC31">Is There a Maximum Price?</h5>

<p>
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will
accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation
(tax-deductible in the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a
tax-exempt public charity.

</p>
<h4 id="SEC32">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</h4>

<p>
In January 1997 we released the
fourth edition of
our CD-ROM that has binaries and complete sources
for GNU compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler.
This enables the people who use these systems to compile GNU and other free
software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.  You can also use
these GNU tools to compile your own C/C<tt>++</tt>/Objective-C programs.
Older editions of this CD are available while supplies last at a reduced
price;
section <a href="#SEC45">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can
help build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with
a C compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses
on
the top menu.

</p>

</li></ul>

<p>
The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced price
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in
section <a href="#SEC37">GNU Documentation</a>.
</p><p>
Much of X11 is <em>not</em> on the older Source CDs.

</p>
<p>
There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the section <a href="#SEC32">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>.

</p>

<h5 id="SEC34">July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs</h5>

<p>
The 10th edition of our Source Code CD
is available now
with two CD-ROM disks.
It has programs, bug fixes, &#38; improvements not on the older Source CDs.
It has these packages, &#38; some manuals that are not part of packages.
The version number of each package listed might be higher on the 10th
edition CD due to new releases being made
since this list was generated.

<h3 id="SEC36">CD-ROM Subscription Service</h3>

<p>
Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source CD-ROMs (plus
shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new versions of the
section <a href="#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>.  The CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued
(currently twice a year).
Subscriptions to the Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM are available on the
same basis; these are usually issued once per year.

</p>
<p>
Each edition of the section <a href="#SEC33">Source Code CD-ROMs</a>, has sources for the X
Window System as well as GNU software.

</p>
<p>
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping
required for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're
in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you
must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping
Costs" on
section <a href="#SEC45">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="SEC37">GNU Documentation</h3>

<p>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online &#38; printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts, describe how to
use all the features of each program, &#38; give examples of command use.  GNU
manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which yield both typeset
hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online hypertext
display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals comes
with our software; here are the manuals that we publish as printed books.
See section <a href="#SEC45">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>,
to order them.

</p>
<p>
Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <em>lay-flat</em>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.
Manuals currently in lay-flat binding are:
<cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite>,
<cite>GDB</cite>,
<cite>Emacs</cite>,
<cite>Emacs Lisp Reference</cite>,
<cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite>,
<cite>GNU Awk User's Guide</cite>,
<cite>Make</cite>,
and
<cite>Bison</cite>.
Our other manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC binding.
Our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in by
11in <cite>Calc</cite> manual.

</p>
<p>
The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was
published.

</p>

<p>
<cite>Debugging with GDB</cite> (for Version 4.16) tells how to run
your program under GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a
program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>GNU Emacs Manual</cite> (13th Edition for Version 20)
describes editing with GNU Emacs.
It explains advanced features, including
international character sets;
outline mode and regular expression search;
how to use special programming modes to write
languages like C<tt>++</tt> and TeX;
how to use the <code>tags</code> utility;
how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings; and
other elementary customizations.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</cite> (October 1995 Edition
1.04) is for people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but
who do want to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you
read it in Emacs under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

</p>
<p>
<cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
and <cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition</cite> (Japanese Draft
Revision 1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29)
cover this programming language in depth, including data types, control
structures, functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes,
windows, keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

</p>
<p>
<cite>The GNU Awk User's Guide</cite> (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0) tells how
to use <code>gawk</code>.  It is written for those who have never used <code>awk</code> and
describes features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.
It clearly delineates those features which are part of POSIX
<code>awk</code> from <code>gawk</code> extensions, providing a comprehensive guide
to <code>awk</code> program portability.

</p>
<p>
<cite>GNU Make</cite> (Edition 0.51 for Version 3.76 Beta) describes GNU
<code>make</code>, a program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual
tells how to write <em>makefiles</em>, which specify how a program is to be
compiled and how its files depend on each other.  Included are an
introductory chapter for novice users and a section about automatically
generated dependencies.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Flex</cite> manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to
write a lexical scanner definition for the <code>flex</code> program to create a
C<tt>++</tt> or C-coded scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need
no prior knowledge of scanners.

</p>

<p>
<cite>The Bison Manual</cite> (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches
you how to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert
into C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

</p>
<p>
<cite>Using and Porting GNU CC</cite> (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2)
tells how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It
lists new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar
with C will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It
also covers G<tt>++</tt>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Texinfo</cite> manual (Edition 2.24 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation &#38; typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
accented &#38; special characters,
indexes, cross references, &#38; how to catch mistakes.

</p>
<p>
<cite>The Termcap Manual</cite> (3rd Edition for Version 1.3), often
described as "twice as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap,"
details the format of the termcap database, the definitions of terminal
capabilities, and the process of interrogating a terminal description.
This manual is primarily for programmers.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>C Library Reference Manual</cite> (Edition 0.08 for Version 2.0)
describes the library's facilities, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" &#38; "system calls."  We are doing small copier runs
of this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to
<code>bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</p>
<p>
The <cite>Emacs Calc Manual</cite> (for Version 2.02) is both a
tutorial and a reference manual.  It tells how to do ordinary
arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of
mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC38">How to Get GNU Software</h3>

<p>
All the software &#38; publications from the FSF are
distributed with permission to modify, copy, and redistribute.
One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can also get GNU software directly from the FSF by ordering
CD-ROMs and books.  Such orders provide most of the
funds for the FSF staff to develop more free software, so please support
our work by ordering from the FSF if you can.
See section <a href="#SEC45">Free Software Foundation Order Form</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software.
Some are listed in section <a href="#SEC11">Free Software Redistributors Donate</a>.  Also see
section <a href="#SEC40">Free Software for Non-Unix-Like Systems</a>.
Please note that the Free Software
Foundation is <em>not</em> affiliated with them in any way and is <em>not</em>
responsible for either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of
their responses.

</p>
<p>
If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free
software, ask them how much they do to assist free software development,
e.g., by contributing money to free software development projects or by
writing free software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision
partially on this factor, you can help encourage support for free
software development.

</p>
<p>
Our main FTP host is very busy &#38; limits the number of logins.  Please use
one of these other sites that also provide GNU software via FTP (program:
<code>ftp</code>, user: <code>anonymous</code>, password: <var>your e-mail
address</var>, mode: <code>binary</code>).  If you
can't reach one of them, get the software from GNU's main FTP host,
<code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code> (IP address: <code>18.159.0.42</code>).  More
hosts &#38; details are in <tt>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</tt> &#38;
<tt>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'</tt> on any host.

</p>
<p>
Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with <code>gzip</code> to
lessen FTP traffic.  Refer to the <tt>`/pub/gnu/README-about-.gz-files'</tt>
on each FTP site for instructions on uncompressing them.
<code>uncompress</code> and <code>unpack</code> <em>do not work</em>!

<h3 id="SEC39">FSF T-shirt</h3>

<p>
The front of our T-shirt
has our "friendly gnu" logo and the words
"GNU's Not Unix!" and "Free Software Foundation".
The shirt's back has a quote from Linus Torvalds:
"Software is like sex: It's better when it's free."
</p><p>
These thick 100% cotton shirts are available
in black or natural (off-white) in sizes M, L, XL, and XXL,
and in burgundy or blue-green in L and XL.
</p><p>
GNU T-shirts often create spontaneous friendships at conferences &#38;
on university campuses.

</p>

<h3 id="SEC40">Free Software for Non-Unix-Like Systems</h3>

<p>
We do not support GNU software on most non-Unix-like systems because it is
peripheral to the GNU Project.  However, we are willing to publish
information about groups who do support and maintain them.  If you are
aware of any such efforts, please send the details, including postal
addresses, archive sites, and mailing lists, to either address on
the top menu.

</p>
<p>
Please do not ask us about any other software.
We do <em>not</em> maintain any of it
and have <em>no</em> additional information.

</p>

<li><b>Boston Computer Society</b>

The BCS had numerous free microcomputer programs, including some GNU
programs.
The BCS is now dissolved
(see <tt>`http://www.bcs.org/'</tt> for details),
but many of the smaller groups operating under it
(see <tt>`http://bcs1.ziplink.net/groups/'</tt> for a list)
are continuing.

</li><li><b>GNU Software on the Amiga</b>
<p>
A large number of GNU programs have been ported to the Amiga
and are part of Geek Gadgets,
a project headed by Fred Fish (<code>fnf@ninemoons.com</code>)
and actively supported by
a dedicated group of Amiga enthusiasts.
There is a mailing list (<code>gg@ninemoons.com</code>)
for general discussion about Geek Gadgets,
and several program specific mailing lists.
Send email to <code>majordomo@ninemoons.com</code>
with the body of the message containing the single word "help",
for more information about what lists are available and how to subscribe.

</li><li>

Volunteers to build binaries for Deluxe Distributions &#38; systems not yet on
the section <a href="#SEC32">January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</a>,
especially systems without a C compiler.
Please contact us at either address on
the top menu.

</li><li>

Writable CD-ROMs

</li><li>

Terminals such as NCD 19r.

</li><li>

Companies to lend good programmers &#38; technical writers for at least six
months.  True wizards may be welcome for less time, but we have found
that this is the minimum time for a programmer to finish a worthwhile
project.

</li><li>

Professors who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting research
assistants to do actual GNU development, with partial FSF support.

</li><li>

New quotes and ideas for articles in the GNU's Bulletin.  We particularly
like to highlight organizations involved with free information exchanges,
software that uses the GNU General Public License, and companies providing
free software support as a primary business.

</li><li>

Information about free software or developers of free software that we may
not know about.  Often, we only find out about interesting projects because
a user writes and asks us why we have not mentioned those projects!

</li><li>

Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU Project or GNU
software.  Send these to the address on
the top menu,
or send a citation to <code>citations@prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.

</li><li>
<p>
Money, as always.
</p><p>
If you use &#38; appreciate our software, please send contributions!
(The simplest way to do this is with your credit card.)
Another good way to help is to buy GNU books, CD-ROMs, and T-shirts.
A business can make a larger contribution by ordering a section <a href="#SEC26">The Deluxe Distribution</a>.  This is especially helpful if you work for an organization
where the word <em>donation</em> is anathema.
Because of the value received, the full dollar amounts of such donations are
not tax-deductible as charitable contributions; however, they may qualify
as a business expense.
