<h3 id="SEC3">GNU's Who</h3>

  <p><b>Randy Smith</b> has joined us as a full-time programmer. He
  is currently maintaining and extending GDB. Our summer people,
  <b>Pete TerMaat</b>, <b>Phil Nelson</b>, and <b>Mike Haertel</b>,
  have returned to school--to study or to teach. Pete worked on
  GDB, Phil on the GNU versions of `cpio' and `dbm', and Mike, who
  continues to work for us part time, on `diff', `egrep' and
  `sort'.</p>

  <p><b>Joe Arceneaux</b> spent a couple of weeks with us this fall
  making Emacs version 19 work with X windows version 11.</p>

  <p><b>Nobuyuki</b> and <b>Mieko</b> <b>Hikichi</b> continue with
  us on loan from Software Research Associates in Tokyo. At FSF,
  Nobu is extending GDB with a C interpreter that he is writing.
  Mieko is helping user-test GNU documentation and is translating
  some of it into Japanese. <b>Diane Barlow Close</b>, our first
  full-time technical writer, is writing the documentation for all
  of the small Unix utilities that have been completed for us,
  while living in San Diego, CA.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, <b>Brian Fox</b> is still working for us at UC
  Santa Barbara. He recently completed GNU's version of `sh', the
  `Bourne Again Shell', that incorporates features found in the
  Korn and C shells. <b>Jay Fenlason</b> is writing a spreadsheet
  program for the project and maintaining the GNU assembler, `tar',
  and `sed'.</p>

  <p><b>Opus Goldstein</b> is our jack-of-all-trades office staff.
  If you call our office, she is the one who answers. She fills the
  orders, and handles the day-to-day operations of the Foundation.
  <b>Robert Chassell</b> is our Treasurer. Besides dealing with
  corporate issues not related to programming, he is working on an
  elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp.</p>

  <p><b>Richard Stallman</b> continues to do countless tasks,
  including refining the C compiler, GNU Emacs, etc. and their
  documentation. <b>Paul Rubin</b> is writing a graphic editing
  extension for GNU Emacs. Finally, <b>Len Tower</b> continues as
  our electronic JOAT (jack-of-all-trades), handling mailing lists,
  information requests, system mothering et al.</p>

<h3 id="SEC5">What Is the Free Software Foundation?</h3>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating
  restrictions on copying, redistribution, understanding and
  modification of computer programs. We do this by promoting the
  development and use of free software in all areas of computer
  use. Specifically, we are putting together a complete integrated
  software system called "GNU" (GNU's Not Unix) that will be upward
  compatible with Unix. Some large parts of this system are already
  working and we are distributing them now.</p>

  <p>The word "free" in our name refers to two specific freedoms:
  first, the freedom to copy a program and give it away to your
  friends and co-workers; second, the freedom to change a program
  as you wish, by having full access to source code. Furthermore,
  you can study the source and learn how such programs are written.
  You may then be able to port it, improve it, and share your
  changes with others.</p>

  <p>Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens
  to be available. By contrast, FSF concentrates on development of
  new free software, building toward a GNU system complete enough
  to eliminate the need to purchase a proprietary system.</p>

  <p>Besides developing GNU, the Foundation has secondary
  functions: producing tapes and printed manuals of GNU software,
  carrying out distribution, and accepting gifts to support GNU
  development. We are tax exempt; you can deduct donations to us on
  your tax returns. Our development effort is funded partly from
  donations and partly from distribution fees. Note that the
  distribution fees purchase just the service of distribution: you
  never have to pay anyone license fees to use GNU software, and
  you always have the freedom to make your copy from a friend's
  computer at no charge (provided your friend is willing).</p>

  <p>The Foundation also maintains a Service Directory: a list of
  people who offer service for pay to individual users of GNU
  programs and systems. Service can mean answering questions for
  new users, customizing programs, porting to new systems, or
  anything else. Contact us if you want to be listed.</p>

  <p>After we create our programs, we continually update and
  improve them. We release between 2 and 20 updates a year, for
  various programs. Doing this while developing new programs takes
  a lot of work, so any donations of pertinent source code and
  documentation, machines, labor or money are always
  appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="SEC6">What Is Copyleft?</h3>

  <p>In the article "What Is the Free Software Foundation," we
  state that "you never have to pay anyone license fees to use GNU
  software, and you always have the freedom to make your copy from
  a friend's computer at no charge." What exactly do we mean by
  this, and how do we make sure that it stays true?</p>

  <p>The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the
  public domain. Then people who get it from sharers can share it
  with others. But bad citizens can also do what they like to do:
  sell binary-only versions under typical
  don't-share-with-your-neighbor licenses. They would thus enjoy
  the benefits of the freeness of the original program while
  withholding these benefits from the users. It could easily come
  about that most users get the program this way, and our goal of
  making the program free for <em>all</em> users would have been
  undermined.</p>

  <p>To prevent this from happening, we don't normally place GNU
  programs in the public domain. Instead, we protect them by what
  we call <em>copylefts</em>. A copyleft is a legal instrument that
  makes everybody free to copy a program as long as the person
  getting the copy gets with it the freedom to distribute further
  copies, and the freedom to modify their copy (which means that
  they must get access to the source code). Typical software
  companies use copyrights to take away these freedoms; now we
  software sharers use copylefts to preserve these freedoms.</p>

  <p>The copyleft used by the GNU project is made from a
  combination of a copyright notice and the <em>GNU General Public
  License</em>. The copyright notice is the usual kind. The General
  Public License is a copying license which basically says that you
  have the freedoms we want you to have and that you can't take
  these freedoms away from anyone else. (The actual document
  consists of several pages of rather complicated legalbol that our
  lawyer said we needed.) A copy of the complete license is
  included in all GNU source code distributions and many manuals,
  and we will send you a printed copy on request.</p>

<h3 id="SEC7">GNU in Japan</h3>

  <p>by Mieko Hikichi</p>

  <p>The GNU Project was described in a seminar at the Unix Fair in
  Tokyo last December This seminar was the first official
  introduction of GNU in Japan.</p>

  <p>I had translated the GNU's Bulletin into Japanese and 500
  copies were distributed. Mr. Yoshitaka Tokugawa talked about what
  is GNU, how to get GNU software and about the GNU license. This
  was followed by a talk about the Japanese version of GNU Emacs by
  Mr. Handa Ken'ichi.</p>

<h3 id="SEC8">The General Public License as a Subroutine</h3>

  <p>We are about to make a sweeping, revolutionary change in the
  General Public License. The terms for copying will be essentially
  unchanged, but the architecture of the legalbol framework used to
  embody them will make a quantum leap.</p>

  <p>In the past, each copylefted program had to have its own copy
  of the General Public License contained in it. Often it was
  necessary to modify the license to mention the name of the
  program it applied to. Other people who wanted to copyleft
  programs had to modify the text even more, to replace our name
  with theirs.</p>

  <p>To make it easier to copyleft programs, we have been improving
  on the legalbol architecture of the General Public License to
  produce a new version that serves as a general-purpose
  subroutine: it can apply to any program without modification, no
  matter who is publishing it. All that's needed is a brief notice
  in the program itself, to say that the General Public License
  applies. Directions on doing this accompany the General Public
  License, so you can easily copyleft your programs.</p>

  <p>We've also taken the opportunity to make it explicit that any
  subsequent changes in future versions the General Public License
  cannot take away the rights you were previously given, if you
  have a program that you received under an earlier version.</p>

  <p>The new version will appear soon; new GNU programs and new
  versions of existing GNU software will refer to it to specify
  their copying conditions.</p>

<h3 id="SEC9">GNUsworthy Flashes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Donation from Hewlett-Packard</b> As part of their
    program to make their machines more attractive to academic
    users, Hewlett-Packard is giving us $100,000. This money was
    given to us to make sure that we have funds to rent office
    space for several years. Of course, if someone were to give us
    office space, we could use the money to hire more people. In
    addition, the company is supporting Michael Tiemann's work at
    Stanford to port G<code>++</code> to the Spectrum.</li>

    <li><b>New Machines</b> Since the last GNUs Bull in June 1988,
    we have received three new machines on loan and three as gifts.
    Thinking Machine, Inc. has loaned us a Sun 4/110, and Intel has
    loaned us an Intel 386. K. Richard Magill has given us an
    AT&amp;T Unix PC and Hewlett-Packard is giving us three
    Spectrums in addition to the funds mentioned above. This makes
    for a total of 13 machines given or loaned to FSF.</li>

    <li><b>Some parts of BSD are becoming free</b> After years of
    urging from us and others, the people who maintain Berkeley
    Unix have decided to release various parts of it (those which
    don't contain AT&amp;T code) separately as free software. This
    includes substantial programs which we hope to use in GNU, such
    as TCP/IP support and possibly the C-shell. The files freed in
    the 4.3 BSD-Tahoe distribution are now on the beta test tape.
    Also, the next release of Berkeley Unix may contain the Make,
    AWK, and `sh' from the GNU Project instead of those from Unix.
    The reason is that the people at Berkeley would like to have
    improvements in these programs like those in system V.3, but
    they find the new restrictions on V.3 licenses unpalatable.
    Both we and they hope they never get a V.3 license. We may help
    them avoid it by providing alternative software. GNU Make
    already supports the system V features, as does GAWK. Both
    programs are in beta test.</li>

    <li><b>The Bison manual is here</b> Dick Karpinski of UCSF
    offered a prize of $1000 for a usable draft of a manual for
    Bison (our species of Yacc). Chuck Donnelly responded with a
    draft which we have turned into a final version. Texinfo source
    comes on both the release and beta test tapes. Hardcopy may be
    ordered directly from the Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>Ghostscript status</b> Ghostscript, the free Postscript
    for GNU, is being distributed. It is now in beta test.</li>

    <li><b>NeXT, Inc. is using GNU software on their machines</b>
    NeXT has decided to use GNU Emacs, GCC, GAS and GDB as part of
    their standard operating system; they are the first computer
    manufacturer to do so. Other manufacturers have expressed an
    interest; we are awaiting developments.</li>

    <li><b>Distribution of 80386 Floppies on hold</b> We are
    holding investigating distribution of floppies for 80386
    machines until we have a working library. Since system V on the
    80386 usually comes with no library as well as no C compiler,
    no assembler and no linker, we don't think this distribution
    medium will be worth while until we can supply all of them.
    This is being worked on, but it will not be ready very soon. We
    will announce on the <code>info-gnu</code> mailing list and
    <code>gnu.announce</code> newsgroup when we have more
    information.</li>

    <li><b>texi2roff</b> Beverly Erlebacher of Toronto, Canada
    wrote `texi2roff'. This program translates GNU Texinfo files
    into a format that can be printed by the Unix `[nt]roff'
    programs utilizing the `mm', `ms' or `me' macro packages.
    Though we won't be maintaining this program, we include it on
    our tapes to allow people without TeX to print out our
    documentation.</li>
  </ul>

<h4 id="SEC10">GNU Wish List</h4>

  <p>Wishes for this issue are for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Volunteers to help write utilities and documentation. One
    important programming project is writing a Fortran compiler
    front end for GCC; documentation particularly needed includes
    manuals for Ghostscript and FLEX.</li>

    <li>FSF is looking to hire additional full-time people to work
    on Project GNU both as programmers and as technical writers. We
    are looking for a few good entities (male or female, carbon or
    silicon based) to work for an activist wage. You must either be
    in Cambridge, Mass or be able to maintain good electronic
    communication with us. Contact
    <code>rms@wheaties.ai.mit.edu</code> or send mail to Richard
    Stallman c/o the Free Software Foundation if you are
    interested.</li>

    <li>Office space (lent or donated) in or around Kendall
    Square.</li>

    <li>Professors who might be interested in sponsoring research
    assistantships with full or partial FSF support to do GNU
    development, or hosting FSF employees.</li>

    <li>Money, as always. Please remember, donations are
    tax-deductible. With the latest donations, we have been able to
    expand our staff. One way to give us a small amount of money is
    to order a distribution tape or two. This may not count as a
    donation for tax purposes, but for many people it can qualify
    as a business expense.</li>

    <li>Someone skilled in compiler maintenance who could take over
    GCC maintenance for RMS. This would probably be be a full-time
    job.</li>

    <li>Interesting, fun GNU graphics. Ghostscript source or
    otherwise. See <cite>GNU "Clip Art" Contest</cite> later in
    this issue for more details.</li>

    <li>Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU
    Project. Send these to the addresses on the front cover.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="SEC11">My Thoughts on the GNU License</h3>

  <p>by Doug Lea</p>

  <p><em>[This article is reproduced from a posting to the
  <code>info-g++</code> and <code>info-gcc</code> mailing lists and
  does not necessarily represent the opinions of the Free Software
  Foundation.--- Editor]</em></p>

  <p>I have not participated publicly in the recent discussions
  about the legal ramifications of the GNU License Agreement until
  now because (1) I am not a lawyer and (2) I find myself in
  agreement with Stallman's decision to proceed very carefully in
  deciding whether and how to modify the Agreement to accommodate
  people who would like to sell works that may or may not be
  considered as `derived' from GNU software, depending on what
  `derived' is defined to mean.</p>

  <p>However, the recent proposal by Gilmore and others appears to
  demand a personal response from me (not RMS or FSF) as the author
  of most of GNU `libg<code>++</code>'. I would like to briefly
  outline why I support FSF goals, and specifically, the Agreement,
  in a way that bears only indirectly on legal principles.</p>

  <p>I am, primarily, a teacher in a liberal arts college. As such,
  I stand for the `free' dissemination of ideas. Historically,
  (please forgive any botching of historical facts to suit my
  needs, but that's what history is for!) the main tool by which
  intellectual property has been allowed to be widely disseminated
  (read `taught') while at the same time both crediting
  originators, and protecting the works from corruption,
  mis--attribution, and so on, has been the notion of Copyright.
  For these reasons, the introduction of copyright laws is widely
  considered to have been an important step in accelerating
  intellectual and scientific progress.</p>

  <p>Sadly, in the science of computing, this solution has not
  stood up well. While, in many disciplines, the price of a
  copyrighted work to be used for study is well within the reach of
  those who could best benefit from it (e.g., a copy of "War and
  Peace" might be $5, or even $50, but not $50,000), the economics
  of computing have, for the most part, priced copyrighted software
  out of the reach of students (and most others). Most readers
  would agree that the study of high-quality existing programs is
  among the better methods for learning about the art of
  programming. These days, one cannot legally show, discuss, and
  teach from, say, Unix or Lotus source code.</p>

  <p>I believe that Stallman's notion that the economics of
  copyright can be separated from its role in the protection and
  propagation of intellectual property is as good a solution to
  this dilemma as we are likely to get. There are many of us,
  especially those of us in academe, who are actually very pleased
  to devote some time and effort to writing software without any
  direct monetyary compensation. For all sorts of reasons. (For
  example, in my case, with `libg<code>++</code>', as a means to
  further investigate the pragmatics of object-oriented programming
  and so on. Or maybe it's just incorrigible hacking. Whatever.
  )</p>

  <p>Now I, and many others, I suspect, are not terribly worried
  about maintaining proper authorship credit, etc., of such work.
  The reason that the GNU License Agreement is attractive is mainly
  that it keeps accessible the work that I intended to be
  accessible, but also generally offers all other benefits that
  Copyright engenders, but that the mere act of placing work in the
  `public domain' would not.</p>

  <p>It is an unfortunate fact that the GNU Agreement currently
  stands in the way of such work being used in honest ways by
  honest programmers who do have to worry about the economic
  ramifications. I personally hope that exactly the right
  accommodations are made to allow fair and sensible use while
  maintaining the ideals that make the GNU solution work. There are
  many sticky legalistic points involved in doing so. I do hope
  that Stallman is able to find such a solution soon enough to make
  alternative approaches less attractive, but not so hastily as to
  compromise the goals of FSF (which I am sure he will not do).</p>

<h3 id="SEC12">GNU Documentation</h3>

  <p>Software distributed as part of the GNU system always comes
  with sources for both on-line documentation and printable
  manuals. On-line documentation is provided because printed
  documentation is often misplaced or is being read by someone else
  when you want it; and because, in many situations, it is easier
  to find the piece of information that you need in an interactive
  on-line help system. At the same time, printed documentation is
  provided because it is often easier to read or preferred.</p>

  <p>When GNU documentation is printed, it is produced as a typeset
  book with chapters, indices, cross references and the like. The
  on-line documentation is a menu-driven system which also uses
  indices and cross references.</p>

  <p>However, instead of writing two different documents, one for
  the on-line documentation and the other for the printed manual,
  GNU documentation uses a single Texinfo source file for both
  purposes. This saves the effort of writing two different
  documents and means that when the system is revised, only one
  source file has to be revised.</p>

  <p>Since the single Texinfo source file is used for a dual
  task--to create both the on-line documentation and the printed
  manual--it must be written in a special format so that the
  chapters and sections of the printed manual will correspond to
  the nodes of the on-line documentation and the indices and cross
  references will correspond to various menus.</p>

  <p>To make the printed manual, the Texinfo source file is
  processed through the TeX typesetting program. To make the
  on-line documentation, using GNU Emacs, the Texinfo source file
  is processed with the <kbd>M-x texinfo-format-buffer</kbd>
  command; the resulting Info file is installed in the
  <tt>`info'</tt> directory which you reach by typing <kbd>C-h
  i</kbd>.</p>

  <p>(Non-GNU software distributed by the Free Software Foundation
  does not always have Texinfo documentation, although we encourage
  everyone to document with it.)</p>

  <p>All of the following manuals, which we are currently
  distributing on our tapes, are also available in hardcopy from
  the Foundation; see the order form on the inside back cover.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Emacs Manual</b> The <cite>Emacs Manual</cite> describes
    how to use GNU Emacs. The manual not only explains Emacs'
    editing features, but it also explains advanced features, such
    as outline mode and regular expression search. The manual tells
    how to use the special modes for programming in languages sucha
    as C and Lisp, how to use the tags utility, and how to compile
    and correct code. It also describes how to make your own
    keybindings and make other elementary customizations.</li>

    <li><b>Texinfo Manual</b> The <cite>Texinfo Manual</cite>
    describes how to write documents in Texinfo source code. It
    describes the markup language used to create both an Info file
    and a printed document from the same source file: how to make
    tables and lists, how to make chapters and nodes, how to make
    indices and cross references. The manual also describe how to
    use Texinfo Mode in GNU Emacs and how to catch mistakes.</li>

    <li><b>Termcap Manual</b> The <cite>Termcap Manual</cite> is
    often described as "Twice as much as you ever wanted to know
    about Termcap". The manual describes the format of the Termcap
    data base, the definitions of terminal capabilities and how to
    find and interrogate a terminal description. This manual is
    primarily for programmers.</li>

    <li><b>Bison Manual</b> The <cite>Bison Manual</cite> describes
    how to write a grammar description that Bison can convert into
    a C program that can parse that grammar. It describes the
    concepts and then provides a series of increasingly complex
    examples before describing what goes on in considerable
    detail.</li>

    <li><b>GDB Manual</b> The <cite>GDB Manual</cite> explains how
    to use the GNU DeBugger. It describes how to run your program
    under control of the debugger, how to examine and alter data
    within the program, and how to modify the flow of control
    within the program. It also explains how to use GDB through GNU
    Emacs, with auto-display of source lines.</li>

    <li><b>GAWK Manual</b> The <cite>GAWK Manual</cite> describes
    how to use the GNU implementation of AWK. It is written for
    someone who has never used AWK before, and describes all the
    features of this powerful string manipulating language.</li>

    <li><b>Make Manual</b> The <cite>Make Manual</cite> describes
    the GNU Make utility, a program used to recompile parts of
    other programs when and as needed. The manual tells how to
    write a Makefile, which describes how to recompile the parts of
    your program and how they depend on each other.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="SEC13">GNU Project Status Report</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>GNU Emacs</b> GNU Emacs 18 is now being distributed. It is
      in wide use on several kinds of BSD 4.2 and 4.3 systems and
      on system V, VMS and Apollo Domain. Version 18.52, the
      current version, adds support for the 80386, the Sun 4, the
      Convex, the IRIS 4D and the HP 9000 series 800; also support
      for system V.3. Berkeley is distributing GNU Emacs with the
      4.3 distribution, DEC is distributing it with Unix systems on
      Vaxes, and NeXT is shipping it. Emacs 18 maintenance is about
      to be finished, and version 19 is being worked on. New
      features so far include multiple X windows, scroll bars,
      per-buffer redefinition of mouse commands, support for
      European character sets, source-level debugging for Emacs
      Lisp, and floating point numbers. Planned possible new
      features include:

      <ul>
        <li>Associating property lists with portions of the text in
        a buffer.</li>

        <li>Using the properties to control which text is
        visible.</li>

        <li>Different visibility conditions for many windows
        showing one buffer.</li>

        <li>Incremental syntax analysis for various programming
        languages.</li>

        <li>An object-oriented graphics-drawing extension.</li>

        <li>Hooks to be run if point moves outside a certain
        range.</li>
      </ul>Once I get time to work on it, it will take several
      months of work to do this, so don't ask when Emacs 19 will be
      available for beta test. We will announce it.
    </li>

    <li><b>Improved GAWK available</b> David Trueman has written
    the new System V extensions to GAWK and the results are now
    available on the beta tape. Meanwhile, a manual for GAWK is on
    its way.</li>

    <li><b>Shells</b> Brian Fox has now completed GNU's version of
    `sh', called the `Bourne Again Shell'. In addition to Korn
    shell features, it now has job control and both Emacs-style and
    `csh'-style command history. There is a good chance that the C
    Shell from BSD will be declared free software by Berkeley, so
    we won't need to write that.</li>

    <li><b>Kernel</b> We hope to use the MACH message-passing
    kernel being developed at CMU. The current version of MACH is
    not free, and cannot be, because it contains the file system
    code from BSD. However, the MACH developers say that all this
    will be replaced with free code, or at least moved into user
    processes, and MACH will be free then. This version of MACH is
    supposed to be released in a few months (as of December 1988).
    If MACH does not become available, then we will probably
    develop the GNU kernel starting with either MIT's TRIX kernel
    or Berkeley's Sprite system. TRIX is a remote procedure call
    kernel that runs and supports basic Unix compatibility at about
    the level of version 7. So it needs a lot of additional
    features. Sprite is mostly at the architectural level of BSD
    Unix, but with a fancy distributed file system and process
    migration. One thing we are considering is adapting the file
    system from Berkeley's Sprite kernel for use in MACH. This file
    system was designed from the beginning to work in a distributed
    manner. The file system is the largest part of MACH that needs
    replacement, now that the Berkeley TCP/IP code, also used in
    MACH, has been declared free.</li>

    <li><b>GNU DeBugger</b> The GNU source-level C debugger, GDB,
    is now being distributed along with Emacs version 18. Currently
    it runs under BSD 4.2 and 4.3 on Vaxes and Suns. It can also
    run stand-alone so we can use it to debug the kernel. An
    over-the-ethernet debugging mode may be added. Work is being
    done on debugging of multiple process parallel programs. GDB
    support for the 32000 is in the current version. GDB can now
    read COFF executables, and it is just starting to work on
    system V. GDB 3.0, recently released for testing, can read
    symbol tables incrementally; this results in much faster
    startup and much less memory use. It also has C<code>++</code>
    support and can run on the 80386 and the Sun 4, as well as on
    some Gould machines. Future versions of GDB may support
    watchpoints, and command editing with identifier
    completion.</li>

    <li><b>C Compiler</b> The GNU C Compiler GCC is now nearly
    reliable. It supports the May 1988 draft of ANSI C. People are
    still reporting bugs, but they also say they think there are
    fewer bugs than in commercial compilers. Some of these bugs
    were uncovered by John Gilmore, who has been compiling all of
    BSD Unix with GNU C. A review comparing GCC with two commercial
    C compilers appeared in the March, 1988 issue of Unix Review
    magazine. The compiler performs automatic register allocation,
    common subexpression elimination, invariant code motion from
    loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation
    and copy propagation, delaying popping of function call
    arguments, tail recursion elimination, plus many local
    optimizations that are automatically deduced from the machine
    description. CPUs supported include the 680x0, Vax, 32x32,
    80386, Sparc (Sun 4), SPUR and Alliant. Ports for the Convex,
    the IBM 370, the IBM PC/RT, the 3b2, some sort of Gould
    machine, the HP Spectrum, the AMD 29000, the MIPS RISC chips,
    and the Motorola 88000 are on their way. GCC makes shorter and
    faster 68020 code than the new Sun compiler with -O. The new
    Sun compiler can't beat GCC despite taking 3 times as long. As
    of version 1.31, GCC also wins on the Sun 4. GCC makes shorter
    Vax code than the Tartan C compiler with -O4, but we haven't
    been able to compare the running speed of that code. A National
    32000 port done by Michael Tiemann on a Sequent 32000 system is
    said to be more reliable than Sequent's compiler and yields a
    40% speedup for several programs including a Prolog
    interpreter. In the future, if we have time, we would like to
    implement some more language extensions, plus facilities for
    precompilation of header files to save time when the headers
    are large and the source files are small. We might also do some
    other language front ends, but there seems to be enough
    interest among remote GNUers in doing this that we might as
    well leave it to them. Enough internal documentation is
    included for people interested in retargeting the compiler to
    other CPUs to do so.</li>

    <li><b>GNU C for VMS</b> Fed up with the deficiencies of the
    VMS C compiler, David Kashtan from SRI decided to spend a
    couple of weeks and make GNU C run on VMS. After making
    considerable changes to satisfy the VMS C compiler, he got it
    running and was able to take most of the changes out. The VMS
    support code is now part of the regular compiler distribution.
    The ordinary VMS C compiler (even if you have it) has bugs and
    therefore cannot compile GNU C: you need an executable of GNU
    C. We offer mag tapes containing VMS binaries of GNU C (as well
    as sources) so you can get started. Other GNU programs
    currently working on VMS include GNU Emacs and Bison. Please
    don't ask us to devote effort to additional VMS support,
    because it is peripheral to the GNU project. We merge in and
    support VMS ports that users do, because it is hard to refuse
    to pass along work that other people have done. But even when
    the changes are clean, this drains considerable effort from our
    real goal, which is to produce a complete integrated system.
    (When they aren't clean, we summon up the courage to ignore
    them.) Merging VMS GNU Emacs and reorganizing the changes to
    ease future maintenance consumed several weeks even though the
    "real work" was done by others. We hope we have learned not to
    let this happen again.</li>

    <li><b>COFF support</b> It is now possible to run the entire
    suite of GNU software tools on system V, replacing COFF
    entirely. First you install the GNU compiler, assembler, linker
    and other utilities. Then you use the program
    `Robotussin'---COFF medicine for your computer--to convert the
    system libraries from COFF format to GNU (i.e. BSD) format.
    When you compile programs, you will get ordinary GNU/BSD object
    files. Linking these with the GNU linker will produce GNU/BSD
    executables with a small amount of COFF header material to
    encapsulate them so that the kernel can run them. The other GNU
    utilities such as `size', `nm' and `strip' know how to operate
    on these encapsulated files. We can't afford to take the time
    to implement or even maintain actual COFF support in these
    utilities. Completing the GNU system is more important to
    us.</li>

    <li>
      <b>Compiler-related programs</b>

      <ul>
        <li><b>C<code>++</code></b> Michael Tiemann of Stanford
        University (once of MCC) has written a C<code>++</code>
        compiler as an extension of GNU C. This is the first
        compiler that compiles C<code>++</code> directly instead of
        preprocessing it into C. A review comparing
        G<code>++</code> with two commercial C<code>++</code>
        compilers appeared in the November, 1988 issue of Unix
        Review magazine. The high marks convinced us it was time to
        start beta testing, so C<code>++</code> is now included on
        the beta tape. We are now working on integrating it with
        the C compiler; the design issues have been solved and a
        merged version will probably be released by the end of
        February. GDB version 3.0 includes support for debugging
        C<code>++</code> code, which will make the program
        GDB<code>+</code> obsolete.</li>

        <li><b>Assembler</b> We have a partially-portable one pass
        assembler, GAS, that is almost twice as fast as the Unix
        assembler. It now works for Vaxes, 680x0, 32x32 and 80386.
        Porting it to other machines should not be hard.</li>

        <li><b>C<code>++</code> library</b> Doug Lea is writing
        `libg<code>++</code>', a library including utility classes
        support for C<code>++</code>.</li>

        <li><b>Object file utilities</b> The GNU replacements for
        `ld', `nm', `size', `gprof', `strip', `ranlib', etc., were
        recently released for testing as part of the GCC test
        distribution. The GNU linker `ld' runs significantly faster
        than the BSD version. Our `ld' is the only one that will
        give you source-line numbered error messages for
        multiply-defined symbols and undefined references.</li>

        <li><b>`gprof' replacement</b> Foundation staffer Jay
        Fenlason has completed a profiler to go with GNU C,
        compatible with `gprof' from Berkeley Unix. It is now in
        the binary file utilities release.</li>

        <li>
          <b>GNU Make extended</b> We have been distributing the
          GNU Make for several months. An extended version, which
          includes more text-processing capabilities and static
          rules, will be released soon. Here is how a GNU Makefile
          can say that the file <tt>`foo'</tt> is linked from the
          object files of all C source files in the current
          directory:
          <pre>
objects:=$(subst .c,.o,$(wildcard *.c))
foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(LDFLAGS)
</pre>GNU Make also supports parallelism.
        </li>

        <li><b>C library</b> Roland McGrath, who contributed a
        great deal to GNU Make, has a nearly complete set of ANSI C
        library functions. We hope they will be ready some time
        this spring. These join the GNU `malloc', `regexp' and
        Termcap libraries that have existed for some time. A newer,
        better `malloc' may be written soon. Meanwhile, Steve
        Moshier has contributed a full series of mathematical
        library functions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Preliminary Ghostscript available</b> We have just started
      to distribute Ghostscript, the free GNU software that
      provides nearly all the facilities of a Postscript
      interpreter. It supports X version 11. Peter Deutsch is still
      doing some work on it. 5~ Right now, Ghostscript will accept
      commands in Postscript and execute them by drawing on an X
      window. It needs enhancement:

      <ul>
        <li>to serve as a previewer for multi-page files.</li>

        <li>to serve other X clients by drawing on their
        windows.</li>

        <li>to improve both the performance and the visual quality
        of the output.</li>

        <li>more fonts.</li>
      </ul>Ghostscript also includes a C-callable graphics library
      (for client programs that don't want to deal with the
      Postscript language), and also supports IBM PCs and
      compatibles with EGA graphics (but please don't ask the FSF
      staff any questions about this; we don't use PCs and don't
      have time to learn anything about them).
    </li>

    <li><b>Finger</b> We will have a daemon-based Finger program
    soon. The daemon polls a selected set of hosts and thus is able
    to tell you where each person is logged in.</li>

    <li><b>Send</b> We are now trying out a Send program for
    sending immediate messages to other users on the same machine
    or other machines.</li>

    <li><b>GNU mailer</b> Landon Noll and Ronald Karr of Amdahl are
    writing a mail queuing and delivery system, called `smail'.
    This project will be a supported part of the Amdahl UTS
    system--and it will be available on exactly the same terms as
    GNU Emacs! We may use this mailer for the GNU system, or
    another mailer, `zmailer', that Rayan Zachariasen is writing,
    or a combination of the two.</li>

    <li><b>Window system</b> We plan to use the X window system
    written at MIT. This system is already available free.</li>

    <li><b>Other utilities</b> The GNU `ls', AWK, Make and `ld' are
    in regular use. Our free replacement for Yacc is called Bison.
    We also have `cron'. We now have the world's fastest
    `grep'/`egrep' and the world's fastest `diff'. A new fast
    `sort' has just been finished. A "fast lex" called FLEX
    recently became available; we are now distributing it.</li>

    <li><b>Documentation system</b> We now have a truly compatible
    pair of programs which can convert a file of Texinfo format
    documentation into either a printed manual or an Info file. See
    <cite>GNU Documentation</cite> earlier in this issue for more
    information.</li>

    <li><b>Possible target machines</b> The GNU Operating System
    will require a CPU that uses 32-bit addresses and integers and
    addresses to the 8-bit byte. 1 megabyte of core should be
    enough, though 2 meg would probably make a noticeable
    improvement in performance. Running some of the system in 1/2
    meg may be possible, but certainly not GNU Emacs. GNU Emacs
    requires more than a megabyte of addressable memory. We expect
    that virtual memory will be required. A hard disk will be
    essential; at least 20 meg will be needed to hold a minimal
    system. Plus more space for the user's files, of course. We
    recommend at least 80 meg for a personal GNU system. This is
    not to say that it will be impossible to adapt some or all of
    GNU for other kinds of machines; but it may be difficult, and
    We don't consider it part of our job to try to reduce that
    difficulty. We have nothing to say about any specific models of
    microcomputer, as we do not follow hardware products.</li>

    <li><b>Porting</b> It is too early to inquire about porting GNU
    (except GNU Emacs and GNU C). First, we have to finish it.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="SEC14">GNU "Clip Art" Contest</h3>

  <p>We are looking for freely redistributable art work and
  graphics to enhance our publications. The art should be about the
  GNU Project or the free software movement. We offer a GNU Manual
  of the artist choice, for each piece of art work which we
  publish. Ghostscript source or more traditional media welcome.
  Send submissions to one of the addresses on the front cover. Our
  thanks to the Icon Project at the University of Arizona for the
  idea of running this contest.</p>

<h3 id="SEC15">GNU Software Available Now</h3>

  <p>We now offer three Unix software source distribution tapes,
  plus VMS tapes for GNU Emacs and GNU C that include sources and
  VMS executables. The first Unix tape (called the "Release" or
  "Emacs" tape) contains GNU Emacs as well as various other
  well-tested programs that we consider reliable. The second ("Beta
  test" or "Compiler") tape contains the GNU C compiler and related
  utilities, and other new programs that are less thoroughly
  tested. The third ("X11") tape contains the X11 distribution from
  the MIT X consortium. Until recently, this software had been
  provided on the Beta test tape, but the third release of the X11
  distribution is too big to fit on this tape. See the order form
  for details about media, etc.</p>

<h4 id="SEC16">Contents of Release tape</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><b>GNU Emacs</b> In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the
    first Emacs: the extensible, customizable real-time display
    editor. GNU Emacs is his second implementation of Emacs. It's
    the first Emacs available on Unix systems that offers true
    Lisp, smoothly integrated into the editor, for writing
    extensions. It also provides a special interface to MIT's free
    X window system, versions 10 and 11, which makes redisplay very
    fast. The current version is GNU Emacs 18.52; version 18.53
    should be released by the time this bulletin sees press. GNU
    Emacs has been in widespread use since 1985 and often displaces
    proprietary implementations of Emacs because of its greater
    reliability as well as its good features and easier
    extensibility. GNU Emacs (as of version 18.52) has run on many
    kinds of Unix systems: those made by Alliant (system releases 1
    to 4), Altos 3068, Amdahl (UTS), Apollo, AT&amp;T (3b machines
    and 7300 pc), CCI 5/32 and 6/32, Celerity, Convex, Digital
    (Vax, not PDP-11; BSD, and SysV), Dual, Elxsi 6400, Encore (DPC
    and APC), Gould, HP (9000 series 200, 300 or 800 (Spectrum) but
    not series 500), HLH Orion 1/05, IBM (RT/PC running 4.2 and
    AIX), Integrated Solutions (Optimum V with 68020 and VMEbus),
    Intel 80386 (BSD, SysV, and Xenix), Iris (2500, 2500 Turbo and
    4D), LMI (Nu), Masscomp, Megatest, MIPS, NCR (Tower 32),
    Nixdorf Targon 31, Plexus, Pyramid, Sequent Balance, SONY News,
    Stride (system release 2), Sun (any kind), Tahoe, Tektronix
    (NS16000 system &amp; 4300), Texas Instruments (Nu), VAX (BSD,
    SysV, VMS) and Whitechapel (MG1). GNU Emacs use is described by
    the GNU Emacs Manual, which comes as a Texinfo file with the
    software. You can read it on-line in Info form or print out
    your own copy. Typeset manuals are also available from the Free
    Software Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>Texinfo</b> Texinfo is the documentation system used for
    all GNU manuals. Documents are written in a simple formatting
    language that can produce either printed manuals using a
    special set of TeX macros, or on-line structured documentation
    that can be read using the Info browser. Included with Texinfo
    is a newly expanded tutorial manual on how to write documents
    using Texinfo.</li>

    <li><b>GDB</b> GDB (the GNU Debugger) is the source-level C
    debugger written for the GNU project in 1986. It offers many
    features not usually found in debuggers on Unix, such as a
    history that records all values examined within the debugger
    for concise later reference, multi-line user-defined commands,
    and a strong self-documentation capability. It currently runs
    on Vaxes under 4.2 and 4.3bsd, on Sun 3 under systems version 2
    and 3 and 4, on the SPARC (Sun 4) under systems version 3.2 and
    4.0, HP9K320, ISI, Merlin, Sony NEWS, Gould NPL and PN, i386,
    and on some 32000 systems. On-line help and a users' manual for
    GDB comes with the software; the printed version of the manual
    is also available from the Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>Bison</b> Bison is an upward-compatible replacement
    parser generator for Yacc, with additional features. It has
    been in use for several years. Bison is used for compiling GNU
    C, so it is included on the GNU CC beta tape as well. A users'
    manual for Bison comes with the software; the printed version
    is also available from the Foundation.</li>

    <li><b>X Window System</b> Version 10 of X Windows is
    distributed on the GNU Emacs tape; version 11 (which is totally
    incompatible) is distributed on the X11 tape. Emacs version
    18.52 supports both versions 10 and 11.</li>

    <li><b>MIT Scheme</b> Scheme is a simplified, lexically scoped
    dialect of Lisp, designed at MIT and other universities for two
    purposes: teaching students of programming, and researching new
    parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques. MIT
    Scheme is written in C and runs on many kinds of Unix systems.
    It now conforms to the "Revised^3 Report On The Algorithmic
    Language Scheme" (MIT AI Lab Memo 848a), for which TeX source
    is included in the distribution.</li>

    <li><b>T</b> A variant of Scheme developed at Yale University,
    T is intended for production use in program development. T
    contains a native-code optimizing compiler that produces code
    that runs at speeds comparable to the running speeds of
    programs written in conventional languages. It runs on BSD
    Vaxes and a few types of 68020 systems. T is written in itself
    and cannot be bootstrapped without a binary (included), but it
    is great if you can use it. Some documentation files are
    included in the distribution.</li>

    <li><b>GNU Chess and Hack</b> GNU Chess is a chess program
    written in C by John Stanback and Stuart Cracraft. It includes
    an extensive opening book and was recently rated by USCF Senior
    Master IM Larry Kaufman at around USCF 1950 (close to expert
    level) when run on a Sun 3 workstation. On a Sun 4, it should
    play at nearly master level. Hack is a display oriented
    adventure game similar to Rogue.</li>
  </ul>

<h4 id="SEC17">Contents of Beta Test Tape</h4>

  <p>The programs on this tape are all recent releases and can be
  considered to be at various stages of user testing. As always, we
  solicit your comments and bug reports. This tape is also known as
  the Compiler tape.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>GNU CC</b> The GNU C compiler is a fairly portable
    optimizing compiler. It generates good code for the 32000,
    680x0, 80386, Alliant, SPARC, SPUR, and Vax CPUs. Machines
    using these CPUs include the Encore NS32000, Genix NS32000,
    Sequent NS32000, AT&amp;T 3b1, HP-UX 68000/68020, ISI
    68000/68020, Sony NEWS, All Sun's, Intel 386, Sequent Intel
    386, Alliant FX/8, and Vax machines. It supports full ANSI C as
    of the latest draft standard. Included with the compiler are
    the GNU assembler GAS, Make, Bison (also on the Emacs release
    tape), and the perfect-hash hash-table generating utility, plus
    the object file utilities `ld', `nm', `size', `strip', `ar',
    `ranlib' and `gprof' and the Texinfo source of <cite>The GCC
    Manual</cite> (for people interested in extending or
    retargeting the compiler).</li>

    <li><b>GAWK and FLEX</b> GAWK is GNU's version of the Unix AWK
    utility. FLEX is a mostly-compatible replacement for the Unix
    `lex' scanner generator written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence
    Berkeley Laboratory. FLEX generates far more efficient scanners
    than `lex' does.</li>

    <li><b>`tar'</b> GNU tar includes multivolume support,
    automatic compression and decompression of archives, remote
    archives, and special features to allow `tar' to be used for
    incremental and full backups of file systems.</li>

    <li><b>Freed files from the U.C. Berkeley 4.3-tahoe release</b>
    These files have been declared by Berkeley to be free of
    AT&amp;T code, and may be freely redistributed. They include
    complete sources for some utility programs and games, as well
    as library routines and partial sources for many others.</li>

    <li><b>`diff' and `grep'</b> These programs are GNU's versions
    of the Unix programs of the same name. They are much faster
    than their Unix counterparts.</li>

    <li><b>Ghostscript, `gnuplot' and `texi2roff'</b> Ghostscript
    is GNU's graphics language. It is almost fully compatible with
    the postscript language. It supports X version 11. `Gnuplot' is
    an interactive program for plotting mathematical expressions
    and data. Oddly enough, the program was neither done for nor
    named for the GNU Project--the name is a coincidence. However,
    we are now distributing it. `texi2roff' translates GNU Texinfo
    files into a format that can be printed by the Unix [nt]roff
    programs utilizing the mm, ms or me macro packages. It is
    included so that people who don't have a copy of TeX can print
    out GNU documentation.</li>

    <li><b>`g++', `libg++' and `oops'</b> G<code>++</code> is a
    front-end for GCC, that compiles C<code>++</code>, an
    object-oriented language that is upward compatible with C.
    Since G<code>++</code> depends on GCC, it can only be used with
    the corresponding version of GCC. <b>libg++</b> (the GNU
    C<code>++</code> library) is a collection of C++ classes and
    support tools for use with G<code>++</code>. OOPS
    (Object-Oriented Program Support) class library is a portable
    collection of classes similar to those in Smalltalk-80 that has
    been developed by Keith Gorlen of NIH, using the
    C<code>++</code> programming.</li>
  </ul>

<h4 id="SEC18">Contents of X11 Tape.</h4>

  <p>X is a portable, network transparent window system for bitmap
  displays written at MIT and DEC. It runs Sun, DEC VAXstation, and
  various other current bitmap displays. X supports overlapping
  windows and fully recursive subwindows, and provides hooks for
  several different styles of user interface. Applications include
  a terminal emulator, bitmap editor, several window managers,
  clock, window dump and undump programs, and several typesetting
  previewers.</p>

  <p>The X11 tape contains Version 11, Release 3 of the MIT/DEC X
  window system. X11 is more powerful than, but incompatible with,
  the no-longer-supported version 10. MIT no longer labels Version
  11 `beta test' but is still releasing frequent patches and
  updates.</p>

<h4 id="SEC19">VMS Emacs and Compiler Tapes</h4>

  <p>We offer a VMS backup tape of the GNU Emacs editor, and a
  separate tape containing the beta-test GNU C compiler. The VMS
  compiler tape also contains Bison (needed to compile GCC), GAS
  (needed to assemble GCC's output) and some library and include
  files. Both VMS tapes include executables that you can bootstrap
  from.</p>

<h3 id="SEC20">How To Get GNU Software</h3>

  <p>All the software and publications from the Free Software
  Foundation are distributed with permission to copy and
  redistribute. The easiest way to get a copy of GNU software is
  from someone else who has it. Just copy it from them.</p>

  <p>If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
  software from the host <tt>`prep.ai.mit.edu'</tt>. For more
  information, read the file
  <tt>`/u2/emacs/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</tt> on that host.</p>

  <p>If you cannot get the software from a friend or over the net,
  or if you would feel more confident getting copies straight from
  us, or if you would like to contribute some funds to our efforts,
  the Free Software Foundation distributes tapes for a copying and
  distribution fee. See the order form on the inside back
  cover.</p>

  <p>If you do not have net access, and your computers cannot use
  the media we distribute on, you must get our software from third
  party groups--people and organizations that do not work with us,
  but have our software in other forms. For your convenience, other
  groups that are helping to spread GNU software are listed below.
  Please note that the Free Software Foundation is <i>not</i>
  affiliated with them in any way, and is not responsible for
  either the currency of their versions or the swiftness of their
  responses.</p>

  <p>These Internet sites have some GNU programs available for
  anonymous FTP:</p>
