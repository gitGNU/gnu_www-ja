<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="bull16.html#TOC4">What Is the Free Software Foundation?</A></H1>

<P>
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.
We promote the development and use of free software in all areas using
computers.  Specifically, we are putting together a complete, integrated
software system named "GNU" ("GNU's Not Unix", pronounced
"guh-new") that will be upwardly compatible with Unix.  Most parts of
this system are already being used and distributed.

</P>
<P>
The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.
You may or may not pay money to get GNU software, but regardless you have
two specific freedoms once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program
and give it away to your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to
change a program as you wish, by having full access to source code.  You
can study the source and learn how such programs are written.  You may then
be able to port it, improve it, and share your changes with others.  If you
redistribute GNU software you may charge a distribution fee or give it away.

</P>
<P>
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to purchase a proprietary system.

</P>
<P>
Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from this distribution
service.

</P>
<P>
The Officers of the Foundation are: Richard M. Stallman, President,
and Lisa Goldstein, Treasurer/Secretary.  The Foundation Board of
Directors are: Richard M. Stallman, Gerald J. Sussman, Harold
Abelson, Robert J. Chassell, and Leonard H. Tower Jr.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="bull16.html#TOC5">What Is Copyleft?</A></H1>

<P>
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.  But this permits proprietary modifications, denying others
the freedom to use and redistribute improvements; it is contrary to the
intent of increasing the total amount of free software.  To prevent this,
<EM>copyleft</EM> uses copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically copyrights
take away freedoms; copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that
requires those who pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify,
and redistribute the code; the code and rights become legally inseparable.

</P>
<P>
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the <EM>GNU General Public License</EM> (GPL).
The GPL is a copying license which basically says that you have the
aforementioned freedoms.  An alternate form, the <EM>GNU Library General
Public License</EM> (LGPL), applies to a few GNU libraries.  This license
permits linking the libraries into proprietary executables under certain
conditions.  The appropriate license is included in all GNU source code
distributions and many manuals.  Printed copies are available upon request.

</P>

<P>
We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation,
and we have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details
on how to apply either license appear at the end of each license.

</P>
<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="bull16.html#TOC6">Donations Translate Into Free Software</A></H1>

<P>
If you appreciate Emacs, GNU CC, Ghostscript, and other free software,
you may wish to help us make sure there is more in the
future--remember, <EM>donations translate into more free software!</EM>

</P>
<P>
Your donation to us is tax-deductible in the United States.  We gladly
accept <EM>all</EM> currencies, although the U.S. dollar is the most
convenient.

</P>
<P>
If your employer has a matching gifts program for charitable donations,
please arrange to have your donation matched by your employer (or in some
cases by Cygnus Support, see "Cygnus Matched Donations!").  If you do
not know, please ask your personnel department.  Also try and get the FSF
listed on the any list of organizations for the matching gifts program.

<P>
To encourage cash donations to the Free Software Foundation, Cygnus Support
will continue to contribute corporate funds to FSF to accompany gifts by
its employees, and by its customers and their employees.

</P>
<P>
Donations payable to the Free Software Foundation should be sent by
eligible persons to Cygnus Support, which will add its gifts and forward the
total to the FSF each quarter.  The FSF will provide the contributor with a
receipt to recognize the contribution (which is tax-deductible on U.S.
tax returns).  For more information, please contact Cygnus at
<CODE>info@cygnus.com.</CODE>

<LI><B>Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</B>

We are now offering a CD-ROM that contains executables for the GNU compiler
tools for some systems for which vendors ship their operating system
without a compiler.  This will allow users of those systems to compile GNU
and other free software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.  See
"Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM" for more details.

We hope to have more systems included with each update of this CD-ROM.  If
you can help build binaries for new systems, or have a system to suggest,
please contact us at either address on the front cover.

<LI><B>FSF Distributing on DAT Cassettes</B>

We are now offering our software on 4mm DAT cassette tapes.  For more
information, see "Free Software Foundation Order Form".

<LI><B>Source CD-ROM subscriptions</B>

We are now offering a subscription service for the Source CD-ROM, in
addition to our tape subscription service.  For the price of 3 CD-ROMs you
get the next 4 that we make.  Presently we make two updates a year, but we
may go to more frequent updates.  See the article "Tape &#38; CD-ROM
Subscription Service".

<LI><B>FSF accepts credit cards</B>

FSF takes these credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, Diner's Club, JCB, and
Carte Blanche.  Note that we are charged about 5% of an order's total
amount in credit card processing fees.  Please consider paying by check
instead, or adding on a 5% donation to make up the difference.

<LI><B>FSF accepts orders and donations via FAX</B>

You can now send orders and donations to FSF by fax.  Please fax in a
completed order form, including credit card information, since orders must
be prepaid.  We do <EM>not</EM> accept purchase orders.  The number is
<TT>+</TT>1-617-492-9057 in the US and everywhere else except Japan.  In
Japan the FAX numbers are toll-free: 0031-13-2473 (KDD) and
0066-3382-0158 (IDC).

<LI><B>FSF T-shirts improved!</B>

We have just added a copy of the GNU General Public License to the back of
our t-shirt, which use to be blank.  See the article "FSF T-shirt"

<LI><B>Informal "GCC Consortium"</B>

A group of companies including Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments, and
Analog Devices have pooled funds to support central maintenance of GNU
CC, which is now done by Richard Kenner of New York University.

The task of central maintenance is to take responsibility for fixing bugs,
integrating and cleaning up contributions, making releases and writing high
priority improvements.

Richard Stallman hopes this will enable him to undertake a new project.

<LI><B>GCC 2 is released, GCC/G<TT>++</TT>/libg<TT>++</TT> 1 Dropped</B>

Since version 2.5.7, the GNU C Compiler has been out of beta test.
G<TT>++</TT> and GCC Version 1 are no longer being maintained or distributed by
the FSF.  Also, libg<TT>++</TT> Version 1 has been dropped.

<LI><B>Free Software Bundled with Hardware</B>

Field Technology, Inc. of Wilton, CT is selling "Linux machines" using
only copylefted &#38; public domain software.  The Unix-compatible systems are
shipped ready to run, with popular programs such as TeX, Emacs, GNU
C/C<CODE>++</CODE>, the X Window System, &#38; TCP/IP networking.  Field Technology
makes a donation to the Free Software Foundation for each system sold.
Contact <CODE>info@fieldtech.com</CODE> or <TT>+</TT>1-203-761-9363 for more
information.

<LI><B>Experimental Tape Takes A Recess</B>

We are not currently distributing the Experimental Tape because most of
programs that were on it are now stable.  GCC, GAS, Binutils, libg<TT>++</TT> &#38;
the GNU C Library have moved to the Languages Tape, replacing prior
releases.  Oleo &#38; GNU Graphics are now on the Utilities Tape.

<LI><B>SNePS Now Free Software</B>

The current release, 2.1, of the Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS),
is publicly available under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  Previously it was available for a licensing fee.

SNePS is the implementation of a fully intensional theory of
propositional knowledge representation and reasoning.  SNePS 2.1
requires Common-Lisp and runs on SPARCs with SunOS 4, as well as the
TI Explorer I/II.  Previous versions ran on Symbolics CL, AKCL,
and VAX Common-Lisp, but the current release remains untested on these
systems.  SNePS can be obtained by anonymous FTP from
<CODE>ftp.cs.buffalo.edu</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/sneps'</TT>.

<LI><B>Lisp Class Library for C<TT>++</TT> Programmers</B>

Lily is a C<CODE>++</CODE> class library providing Lisp-like functionality,
including automatic garbage collection.  Lily is available by
anonymous FTP from <CODE>sunsite.unc.edu</CODE>.  For more info,
write <CODE>sheldon@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov</CODE>.

<LI><B>Free Widget Foundation Announces Widgets</B>

The Free Widget Foundation (FWF) is a
grass-roots, all
volunteer effort to create a set of powerful, flexible,
freely-accessible X graphical user-interface modules (widgets).
Since its start in 1990, the FWF release has grown to over 40
widgets, now used in several popular X applications.
The FWF is not related to the Free Software Foundation, but it shares our
goal of making high-quality software freely redistributable.

The US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) will hold hearings early in 1994
on the topic of software patents.  The PTO is recognizing that something is
very wrong with the current policy and is looking for input on how to
correct matters.  The LPF is trying to get a representative invited to
testify, and will call for members and others concerned with these issues
to write letters to the PTO.  Contact <CODE>lpf@uunet.uu.net</CODE> for details.

</P>
<P>
For the last few months, the LPF has been working on an amicus (friend of
the court) brief which was presented to the appeal court in the appeal of
Lotus v. Borland.  The brief was directed solely at the Lotus claim to
copyright over the macro language in <CODE>123</CODE> which was allowed by Judge
Keeton in the lower court.  The brief was filed on behalf of over 20
prominent computer scientists in the First Circuit Court on December 14,
1993.

</P>
<P>
The group that the LPF organized to sign the brief included such major
contributors to computer science as Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, and
Robert Boyer.  Bob Kohn, Borland VP and General Counsel, stated, "With
this group the LPF should be able to change the course of intellectual
property law.  Never has such an impressive group of computer scientists
been assembled."

The Free Software Foundation does not provide any technical support.
Although we create software, we leave it to others to earn a living

<H1><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="bull16.html#TOC13">Towards a New Strategy of OS Design</A></H1>

<P>
This article explains why FSF is developing a new operating system
named the Hurd, which will be a foundation of the whole GNU system.
The Hurd is built on top of CMU's Mach 3.0 kernel and uses Mach's
virtual memory management and message-passing facilities.
The GNU C Library will provide the Unix system call interface, and will
call the Hurd for needed services it can't provide itself.
The design and implementation of the Hurd is being lead by Michael
Bushnell, with assistance from Richard Stallman, Roland McGrath, Jan
Brittenson, and others.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="bull16.html#TOC14">Part 1 - A More Usable Approach to OS Design</A></H3>

<P>
The fundamental purpose of an operating system (OS) is to enable a variety of
programs to share a single computer efficiently and productively.  This
demands memory protection, preemptively scheduled timesharing,
coordinated access to I/O peripherals, and other services.  In addition,
an OS can allow several users to share a computer.  In
this case, efficiency demands services that protect users from harming
each other, enable them to share without prior arrangement, and mediate
access to physical devices.

</P>
<P>
On today's computer systems, programmers usually implement these goals
through a large program called the kernel.  Since this program must be
accessible to all user programs, it is the natural place to add
functionality to the system.  Since the only model for process
interaction is that of specific, individual services provided by the
kernel, no one creates other places to add functionality.  As time goes
by, more and more is added to the kernel.

</P>
<P>
A traditional system allows users to add components to a kernel only if
they both understand most of it and have a privileged status within the
system.  Testing new components requires a much more painful
edit-compile-debug cycle than testing other programs.  It cannot be done
while others are using the system.  Bugs usually cause fatal system
crashes, further disrupting others' use of the system.  The entire
kernel is usually non-pageable.  (There are systems with pageable
kernels, but deciding what can be paged is difficult and error prone.
Usually the mechanisms are complex, making them difficult to use even
when adding simple extensions.)

</P>
<P>
Because of these restrictions, functionality which properly belongs
<EM>behind</EM> the wall of a traditional kernel is usually left out of
systems unless it is absolutely mandatory.  Many good ideas, best
done with an open/read/write interface cannot be implemented
because of the problems inherent in the monolithic nature of a
traditional system.  Further, even among those with the endurance to
implement new ideas, only those who are privileged users of their
computers can do so.  The software copyright system darkens the mire by
preventing unlicensed people from even reading the kernel source.

</P>
<P>
Some systems have tried to address these difficulties.  Smalltalk-80
and the Lisp Machine both represented one method of getting around the
problem.  System code is not distinguished from user code; all of the
system is accessible to the user and can be changed as need be.  Both
systems were built around languages that facilitated such easy
replacement and extension, and were moderately successful.  But they
both were fairly poor at insulating users and programs from each other,
failing one of the principal goals of OS design.

</P>
<P>
Most projects that use the Mach 3.0 kernel carry on the
hard-to-change tradition of OS design.  The internal
structure is different, but the same heavy barrier between user and
system remains.  The single-servers, while fairly easy to construct,
inherit all the deficiencies of the monolithic kernels.

</P>
<P>
A multi-server divides the kernel functionality up into logical
blocks with well-defined interfaces.  Properly done, it is easier to
make changes and add functionality.  So most multi-server projects do
somewhat better.  Much more of the system is pageable.  You can debug
the system more easily.  You can test new system components without
interfering with other users.  But the wall between user and system
remains; no user can cross it without special privilege.

</P>
<P>
The GNU Hurd, by contrast, is designed to make the area of <EM>system</EM>
code as limited as possible.  Programs are required to communicate only
with a few essential parts of the kernel; the rest of the system is
replaceable dynamically.  Users can use whatever parts of the remainder
of the system they want, and can easily add components themselves for
other users to take advantage of.  No mutual trust need exist in advance
for users to use each other's services, nor does the system become
vulnerable by trusting the services of arbitrary users.

</P>
<P>
This has been done by identifying those system components which
users <EM>must</EM> use in order to communicate with each other.  One of these is
responsible for identifying users' identities and is called the
<EM>authentication server</EM>.  In order to establish each other's identities,
programs must communicate, each with an authentication server they
trust.  Another component establishes control over system components by
the superuser, provides global bookkeeping operations, and is called
the <EM>process server</EM>.

</P>
<P>
Not all user programs
need to communicate with the process server; it is only necessary for
programs which require its services.  Likewise, the authentication
server is only necessary for programs that wish to communicate their
identity to another.  None of the remaining services carry any special
status; not the network implementation, the filesystems, the program
execution mechanism (including setuid), or any others.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="bull16.html#TOC15">The Translator Mechanism</A></H4>

<P>
The Hurd uses Mach ports primarily as methods for communicating between
users and servers.  (A Mach port is a communication point on a Mach task
where messages are sent and received.)  Each port implements a
particular set of protocols, representing operations that can be
undertaken on the underlying object represented by the port.  Some of
the protocols specified by the Hurd are the I/O protocol, used for
generic I/O operations; the file protocol, used for filesystem
operations; the socket protocol, used for network operations; and the
process protocol, used for manipulating processes et al.

</P>
<P>
Most servers are accessed by opening files.  Normally, when you open a file,
you create a
a port associated with that file that is owned by the server that owns
the directory containing the file.  For example, a disk-based
filesystem will normally serve a large number of ports, each of which
represents an open file or directory.  When a file is opened, the
server creates a new port, associates it with the file, and returns the
port to the calling program.

</P>
<P>
However, a file can have a <EM>translator</EM> associated with it.  In
this case, rather than return its own port which refers to the contents
of the file, the server executes a translator program associated with
that file.  This translator is given a port to the actual contents of
the file, and is then asked to return a port to the original user to
complete the open operation.

</P>
<P>
This mechanism is used for <CODE>mount</CODE> by having a translator
associated with each mount point.  When a program opens the mount
point, the translator (in this case, a program which understands the
disk format of the mounted filesystem) is executed and returns a port to
the program.  After the translator is started, it need not be run again
unless it dies; the parent filesystem retains a port to the translator
to use in further requests.

</P>
<P>
The owner of a file can associate a translator with it
without special permission.  This means that any program can be
specified as a translator.  Obviously the system will not work
properly if the translator does not implement the file protocol
correctly.  However, the Hurd is constructed so that the worst
possible consequence is an interruptible hang.

</P>
<P>
One way to use translators is to access hierarchically structured data
using the file protocol.  For example, all the complexity of the user
interface to the <CODE>ftp</CODE> program is removed.  Users need only know
that a particular directory represents FTP and can use all the standard
file manipulation commands (e.g <CODE>ls</CODE> or <CODE>cp</CODE>) to access the
remote system, rather than learning a new set.  Similarly, a simple
translator could ease the complexity of <CODE>tar</CODE> or <CODE>gzip</CODE>.
(Such transparent access would have some added cost, but it would be
convenient.)

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="bull16.html#TOC16">Generic Services</A></H4>

<P>
With translators, the filesystem can act as a
rendezvous for interfaces which are not similar to files.  Consider a
service which implements some version of the X protocol, using Mach
messages as an underlying transport.  For each X display, a file can
be created with the appropriate program as its translator.  X clients
would open that file.  At that point, few file operations would be useful
(read and write, for example, would be useless), but new operations
(<CODE>XCreateWindow</CODE> or <CODE>XDrawText</CODE>) might become meaningful.  In this
case, the filesystem protocol is used only to manipulate
characteristics of the node used for the rendezvous.  The node need
not support I/O operations, though it should reply to any such
messages with a <CODE>message_not_understood</CODE> return code.

</P>
<P>
This translator technique is used to contact most of the services in the Hurd
that are not structured like hierarchical filesystems.  For example,
the password server, which hands out authorization tags in exchange
for passwords, is contacted this way.  Network protocol servers
are also contacted in this fashion.  Roland McGrath thought up this
use of translators.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="bull16.html#TOC17">Clever Filesystem Pictures</A></H4>

<P>
In the Hurd, translators can also be used to present a filesystem-like
view of another part of the filesystem, with some semantics changed.
For example, it would be nice to have a filesystem that cannot itself be
changed, but nonetheless records changed versions of its files
elsewhere.  (This could be useful for source code management.)

</P>
<P>
The Hurd will have a translator which creates a directory which is a
conceptual union of other directories, with collision resolution rules
of various sorts.  This can be used to present a single directory to
users that contains all the programs they would want to execute.  There
are other useful variations on this theme.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="bull16.html#TOC18">What The User Can Do</A></H4>

<P>
No translator gains extra privilege by virtue of being hooked into the
filesystem.  Translators run with the uid of the owner of the file being
translated, and can only be set or changed by that owner.
The I/O and
filesystem protocols are carefully designed to allow their use by
mutually untrusting clients and servers.  Indeed, translators are just
ordinary programs.  The GNU C library has a variety of facilities to
make common sorts of translators easier to write.

</P>
<P>
Some translators may need special privileges,
such as the password server or translators which allow setuid execution.
These translators could be run by anyone, but
only if they are set on a root-owned node would they be able
to provide all their services successfully.  This is analogous to
letting any user call the <CODE>reboot</CODE> system call, but only honoring it if
that user is root.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="bull16.html#TOC19">Why This Is So Different</A></H4>

<P>
What this design provides is completely novel to the
Unix world.  Until now, OSs have kept huge
portions of their functionality in the realm of system code, thus
preventing its modification and extension except in extreme
need.  Users cannot replace parts of the system in their
programs no matter how much easier that would make their task, and
system managers are loath to install random tweaks off the net into
their kernels.

</P>
<P>
In the Hurd, users can change almost all of the things that are
decided for them in advance by traditional systems.  In combination
with the tremendous control given by the Mach kernel over task address
spaces and properties, the Hurd provides a system in which
users will, for the first time, be able to replace parts of the system
they dislike,
without disrupting other users.

</P>
<P>
Most Mach-based OSs to date have mostly implemented a wider set of the
<EM>same old</EM> Unix semantics in a new environment.  In contrast, GNU is
extending those semantics to allow users to improve, bypass,
or replace them.

</P>
<P>
 


<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="bull16.html#TOC20">Part 2 - A Look at Some of the Hurd's Beasts</A></H3>

<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="bull16.html#TOC21">The Authentication Server</A></H4>

<P>
One of the Hurd's more central servers is the authentication
server.  Each port to this server identifies a user and
is associated by this server with an <EM>id block</EM>.  Each
id block contains sets of user and group ids.  Either
set may be empty.  This server is not the same as the password
server referred to above.

</P>
<P>
The authentication server exports three services.  First, it provides
simple boolean operations on authentication ports: given two
authentication ports, this server will provide a third
port representing the union of the two sets of uids and gids.
Second,  this server allows any user with a uid of zero
to create an arbitrary authentication port.
Finally, this server provides RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls
between different programs and possibly different hosts) which allow mutually
untrusting clients and servers to establish their identities and pass initial
information on each other.  This is crucial to the security of the
filesystem and I/O protocols.

</P>
<P>
Any user could write a program which implements the authentication
protocol; this does not violate the system's security.
When a service needs to authenticate a user, it communicates
with its trusted authentication server.  If that user is using a
different authentication server, the transaction will fail and the
server can refuse to communicate further.  Because, in effect, this
forces all programs on the system to use the same authentication
server, we have designed its interface to make any safe operation
possible, and to include no extraneous operations.  (This is why
there is a separate password server.)

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="bull16.html#TOC22">The Process Server</A></H4>

<P>
The process server acts as an information
categorization repository.  There are four main services supported by
this server.  First, the process server keeps track of generic
host-level
information not handled by the Mach kernel.  For example, the hostname,
the hostid,
and the system version are maintained by the process server.
Second, this server maintains the Posix notions of sessions and
process groups, to help out programs that wish to use
Posix features.

</P>
<P>
Third, the process server maintains a one-to-one mapping between Mach
tasks and Hurd processes.  Every task is assigned a pid.  Processes can
register a message port with this server, which can then be given out to
any program which requests it.  This server makes no attempt to keep
these message ports private, so user programs are expected to implement
whatever security they need themselves.  (The GNU C Library provides
convenient functions for all this.) Processes can tell the process
server their current <CODE>argv</CODE> and <CODE>envp</CODE> values; this server
will then provide, on request, these vectors of arguments and
environment.  This is useful for writing <CODE>ps</CODE>-like programs and
also makes it easier to hide or change this information.  None of these
features are mandatory.  Programs are free to disregard all of this and
never register themselves with the process server at all.  They will,
however, still have a pid assigned.

</P>
<P>
Finally, the process server implements <EM>process collections</EM>, which
are used to collect a number of process message ports at the same time.
Also, facilities are provided for converting between pids, process
server ports, and Mach task ports, while ensuring the security of the
ports managed.

</P>
<P>
It is important to stress that the process server is optional.  Because
of restrictions in Mach,
programs must run as root in order to identify
all the tasks in the system.  But given that, multiple process servers
could co-exist, each with their own clients, giving their own model of
the universe.  Those process server features which do not require root
privileges to be implemented could be done as per-user servers.  The
user's hands are not tied.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="bull16.html#TOC23">Transparent FTP</A></H4>

<P>
Transparent FTP is an intriguing idea whose time has come.  The popular
<CODE>ange-ftp</CODE> package available for GNU Emacs makes access to FTP
files virtually transparent to all the Emacs file manipulation
functions.  Transparent FTP does the same thing, but in a system wide
fashion.  This server is not yet written; the details remain to be
fleshed out, and will doubtless change with experience.

</P>
<P>
In a BSD kernel, a transparent FTP filesystem would be no harder to
write than in the Hurd.  But mention the idea to a BSD kernel hacker,
and the response is that "such a thing doesn't belong in the kernel".
In a sense, this is correct.  It violates all the layering principles of
such systems to place such things in the kernel.  The unfortunate side
effect, however, is that the design methodology (which is based on
preventing users from changing things they don't like) is being used to
prevent system designers from making things better.  (Recent BSD kernels
make it possible to write a user program that provides transparent FTP.
An example is <CODE>alex</CODE>, but it needs to run with full root
privileges.)

</P>
<P>
In the Hurd, there are no obstacles to doing transparent FTP.  A
translator will be provided for the node <TT>`/ftp'</TT>.  The contents of
<TT>`/ftp'</TT> will probably not be directly listable, though further
subdirectories will be.  There will be a variety of possible formats.
For example, to access files on uunet, one could <CODE>cd
/ftp/ftp.uu.net:anonymous:mib@gnu</CODE>.  Or to access files on a remote
account, one might <CODE>cd /ftp/gnu.ai.mit.edu:mib:passwd</CODE>.  Parts
of this command could be left out and the transparent FTP program would
read them from a user's <TT>`.netrc'</TT> file.  In the last case, one might
just <CODE>cd /ftp/gnu.ai.mit.edu</CODE>; when the rest of the data is
already in <TT>`.netrc'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
There is no need to do a <CODE>cd</CODE> first--use any file command.  To
find out about RFC 1097 (the Telnet Subliminal Message Option), just
type <CODE>more /ftp/ftp.uu.net/inet/rfc/rfc1097</CODE>.  A copy command
to a local disk could be used if the RFC would be read frequently.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="bull16.html#TOC24">Filesystems</A></H4>

<P>
Ordinary filesystems are also being implemented.  The initial release of
the Hurd will contain a filesystem upwardly compatible with the BSD 4.4
Fast File System.  In addition to the ordinary semantics, it will
provide means to record translators, offer thirty-two bit user ids and
group ids, and supply a new id per file, called the <EM>author</EM> of the
file, which can be set by the owner arbitrarily.  In addition, because
users in the Hurd can have multiple uids (or even none), there is an
additional set of permission bits providing access control for <EM>unknown
user</EM> (no uids) as distinct from <EM>known but arbitrary user</EM> (some
uids: the existing <EM>world</EM> category of file permissions).

</P>
<P>
The Network File System protocol will be implemented using 4.4 BSD as a
starting point.  A log-structured filesystem will also be implemented
using the same ideas as in Sprite, but probably not the same format.
A GNU network file protocol may be designed in time, or NFS may be
extended to remove its deficiencies.  There will also be various
"little" filesystems, such as the MS-DOS filesystem, to help people
move files between GNU and other OSs.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="bull16.html#TOC25">Terminals</A></H4>

<P>
An I/O server will provide the terminal semantics of
Posix.  The GNU C Library has features for keeping track of the
controlling terminal and for arranging to have proper job control
signals sent at the proper times, as well as features for obeying keyboard and
hangup signals.

</P>
<P>
Programs will be able to insert a terminal driver into communications
channels in a variety of ways.  Servers like <CODE>rlogind</CODE> will be able
to insert the terminal protocol onto their network communication port.
Pseudo-terminals will not be necessary,
though they will be provided for backward compatibility with older
programs.  No programs in GNU will depend on them.

</P>
<P>
Nothing about a terminal driver is forced upon users.  A terminal
driver allows a user to get at the underlying communications channel
easily, to bypass itself on an as-needed
basis or altogether, or to substitute a different terminal
driver-like program.  In the last case, provided the alternate
program implements the necessary interfaces, it will be used by the C
Library exactly as if it were the ordinary terminal driver.

</P>
<P>
Because of this flexibility, the original terminal driver will not
provide complex line editing features, restricting itself to the
behavior found in Posix and BSD.  In time, there will be a
<CODE>readline</CODE>-based terminal driver, which will provide
complex line-editing
features for those users who want them.

</P>
<P>
The terminal driver will probably not provide good support for the
high-volume, rapid data transmission required by UUCP or SLIP.  Those
programs do not need any of its features.  Instead they will be use the
underlying Mach device ports for terminals, which support moving large
amounts of data efficiently.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="bull16.html#TOC26">Executing Programs</A></H4>

<P>
The implementation of the <CODE>execve</CODE> call is spread across
three programs.  The library marshals the argument and
environment vectors.  It then sends a message to the file server that
holds the file to be executed.  The file server checks execute
permissions and makes whatever changes it desires in the exec call.  For
example, if the file is marked setuid and the fileserver has the
ability, it will change the user identification of the new
image.  The file server also decides if programs which
had access to the old task should continue to have access to the new
task.  If the file server is augmenting permissions, or executing an
unreadable image, then the exec needs to take place in a
new Mach task to maintain security.

</P>
<P>
After deciding the policy associated with the new image, the filesystem
calls the exec server to load the task.  This server, using the
BFD (Binary File Descriptor) library, loads the image.  BFD supports a
large number of object file formats; almost any supported format will
be executable.  This server also handles scripts starting with
<CODE>#!</CODE>, running them through the indicated program.

</P>
<P>
The standard exec server also looks at the environment of the new image;
if it contains a variable <CODE>EXECSERVERS</CODE> then it uses the programs
specified there as exec servers instead of the system default.  (This
is, of course, not done for execs that the file server has requested be
kept secure.)

</P>
<P>
The new image starts running in the GNU C Library, which sends a message to
the exec server to get the arguments, environment, umask, current
directory, etc.  None of this additional state is special to the file or
exec servers; if programs wish, they can use it in a different manner
than the Library.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="bull16.html#TOC27">New Processes</A></H4>

<P>
The <CODE>fork</CODE> call is implemented almost entirely in the GNU C Library.  The
new task is created by Mach kernel calls.  The C Library arranges to
have its image inherited properly.  The new task is registered with
the process server (though this is not mandatory).  The C Library
provides vectors of functions to be called at fork time: one vector to
be called before the fork, one after in the parent, and one after in
the child.  (These features should not be used to replace the normal
fork-calling sequence; it is intended for libraries which need to close ports
or clean up before a fork occurs.)  The C library will
implement both fork calls specified by the draft Posix.4a (the proposed
standard dealing with the threads
extension to the real-time extension).

</P>
<P>
Nothing forces the user to create new tasks this way.  If a program
wants to use almost the normal fork, but with some special
characteristics, then it can do so.  Hooks will be provided by the C
Library, or the function can even be completely replaced.
None of this is possible in a traditional Unix system.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="bull16.html#TOC28">Asynchronous Messages</A></H4>

<P>
As mentioned above, the process server maintains a "message port" for
each task registered with it.  These ports are public, and are used to
send asynchronous messages to the task.  Signals, for example, are
sent to the message port.  The signal message also provides a port as
an indication that the sender should be trusted to send the signal.
The GNU C Library lists a variety of ports in a table, each of which
identifies a set of signals that can be sent by anyone who possesses
that port.  For example, if the user possesses the task's kernel port,
it is allowed to send any signal.  If the user possesses a special
"terminal id" port, it is allowed to send the keyboard and hangup
signals.  Users can add arbitrary new entries into the C library's
signal permissions table.

</P>
<P>
When a process's process group changes, the process server will send
it a message indicating the new process group.  In this case, the
process server proves its authority by providing the task's kernel
port.

</P>
<P>
The C library also has messages to add and delete uids currently used by
the process.  If new uids are sent to the program, the library adds them
to its current set, and then exchanges messages with all the I/O servers
it knows about, proving to them its new authorization.  Similarly, a
message can delete uids.  In the latter case, the caller must provide
the process's task port.  (You can't harm a process by giving it extra
permission, but you can harm it by taking permission away.)  The Hurd
will provide user programs to send these messages to processes.  For
example, the <CODE>su</CODE> command will be able to cause all the programs in
your current login session, to gain a new uid, rather than spawn a
subshell.

</P>
<P>
The C library will allow programs to add asynchronous messages they wish
to recognize, as well as prevent recognition of the standard set.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="bull16.html#TOC29">Making It Look Like Unix</A></H4>

<P>
The C Library will implement all of the calls from BSD and Posix as well
as some obvious extensions to them.  This enables users to replace
those calls they dislike or bypass them entirely, whereas in Unix
the calls must be used "as they come" with no alternatives possible.

</P>
<P>
In some environments binary compatibility will also be supported.
This works by building a special version of the library which is then
loaded somewhere in the address space of the process.  (For example, on
a VAX, it would be tucked in above the stack.)  A feature of Mach,
called system call redirection, is then used to trap Unix system calls
and turn them into jumps into this special version of the library.
(On almost all machines, the cost of such a redirection is very small;
this is a highly optimized path in Mach.  On a 386 it's about two
dozen instructions.  This is little worse than a simple
procedure call.)

</P>
<P>
Many features of Unix, such as signal masks and vectors, are handled
completely by the library.  This makes such features significantly
cheaper than in Unix.  It is now reasonable to use <CODE>sigblock</CODE> extensively
to protect critical sections, rather than seeking out some other, less
expensive method.

</P>
<P>
 


<H4><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="bull16.html#TOC30">Network Protocols</A></H4>

<P>
The Hurd will have a library that will make it very easy to port 4.4 BSD
protocol stacks into the Hurd.  This will enable operation, virtually
for free, of all the protocols supported by BSD.  Currently, this
includes the CCITT protocols, the TCP/IP protocols, the Xerox NS
protocols, and the ISO protocols.

</P>
<P>
For optimal performance some work would be necessary to take advantage
of Hurd features that provide for very high speed I/O.  For most
protocols this will require some thought, but not too much time.  The
Hurd will run the TCP/IP protocols as efficiently as possible.

</P>
<P>
As an interesting example of the flexibility of the Hurd design,
consider the case of IP trailers, used extensively in BSD for
performance.  While the Hurd will be willing to send and receive
trailers, it will gain fairly little advantage in doing so because
there is no requirement that data be copied and avoiding copies
for page-aligned data is irrelevant.

</P>

<H1><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="bull16.html#TOC31">Second Annual GNU Seminar in Japan</A></H1>

<P>
Wingnut and the FSF sponsored the second GNU Technical Seminar in
Tokyo on December 1 and 2, 1993.  Richard Stallman spoke on the
GNU Project and the FSF.  Jim Blandy then spoke on GNU Emacs 19.
Finally Manabu Higashida spoke on Demacs (see "Free Software for
Microcomputers").  Bob Myers and David Littleboy translated
the English lectures into Japanese.  Software Research Associates,
Inc. (SRA), the SRA/Wingnut project and their staff provided
help in countless ways for this seminar and the entire trip to Japan.
About 70 people attended the seminar, and several Japanese publications
interviewed Richard Stallman.  The FSF also premiered the new
edition of it's Source Code CD-ROM.

</P>
<P>
Seminars were also held at
Sendai on Dec 6th, where Richard Stallman spoke;
The University of Aizu on Dec 7th, where Richard Stallman and

<B>GNU Software Configuration Scheme</B>

We are using a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages
in order to compile them.  All GNU software supports the same
alternatives for naming machine and system types.  This makes it
possible to configure any and all GNU software in the same manner.

The configuration scheme also supports configuring a directory
containing several GNU packages with one command.  When the operating
system is completed, it will be possible to configure the entire system
at once, eliminating the need to separately configure each of the
individual packages that make up the GNU system.

The configuration scheme can also specify both the host and target system,
so you can easily configure and build cross-compilation tools.

<LI>

<B>The Hurd</B>

We are developing the GNU Hurd, a set of servers that run on top of Mach
(for more information, see "Towards a New Strategy of Operating System
Design").  Mach is a free message-passing kernel being developed at CMU.
The Hurd servers, working with the GNU C Library, will provide Unix-like
functionality.  They are the last major components necessary for a complete
GNU system.

Currently there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress.
Contact CMU c/o <CODE>mach@cs.cmu.edu</CODE> if you want to help with one
of those or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd and GNU C Library is
easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier than porting GCC)
once a Mach port to a particular kind of hardware exists.

Significant progress has been made recently: the filesystem is coming up
and several other servers are running.
There are significant projects relating to the Hurd for which we need
volunteers.  Experienced system programmers who are interested should send
mail to <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI>

<B>GNU Emacs</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor.  The current version is GNU Emacs 19.22.

A number of volunteers have been especially helpful on Emacs 19.  Thanks to
Alan Carroll and the people who worked on Epoch for generating initial
feedback to a multi-windowed Emacs, to Lucid, Inc. for implementing X
Selections, faces, the optimizing byte compiler, and the default menu
bar,
to Eric Raymond who has evaluated 460 out of 851 possible new
Lisp libraries, and to Stephen Gildea for making the Emacs 19
reference card.

Features planned for later releases of Emacs include: different
visibility conditions for regions, and for various windows showing one
buffer; incrementally saving the undo history in a file, so that
<CODE>recover-file</CODE> also reinstalls the buffer's undo history; support
for variable-width fonts; support for wide character sets including all
the world's major languages; and support for display using an X toolkit.

<LI>

<B>GNU Fortran (<CODE>g77</CODE>)</B>

GNU Fortran is in "private" alpha test (testing by a small group of
experts) and is not yet publicly released.  Until <CODE>g77</CODE> is fully
released to the public, we ask people to use <CODE>f2c</CODE> (a Fortran-to-C
translator) with <CODE>gcc</CODE> (the GNU C compiler).  As <CODE>g77</CODE> uses a lot
of these tools (the <CODE>f2c</CODE> libraries and the <CODE>gcc</CODE> back end),
using them and reporting any problems you find will help speed the release
of <CODE>g77</CODE>.  For more information on <CODE>f2c</CODE> and <CODE>gcc</CODE>, see "GNU
Software Available Now."

The primary focus of the alpha test is to test the <CODE>g77</CODE> front end,
since that has most of the new code.  The secondary focus of the alpha
test is to test the integration between the front end and the back end.
Currently, this is where most of the bugs seem to be.  The tertiary
focus is the quality of code generated by the GNU back end for Fortran.

We hope to have a <CODE>g77</CODE> beta release in early spring 1994, as part of
the regular compiler distribution.

A mailing list exists for announcements about <CODE>g77</CODE>.  To subscribe,
ask <CODE>info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  To contact the
author and maintainer of <CODE>g77</CODE>, write to
<CODE>fortran@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI>

<B>C Compiler</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler has been released.  We are no longer
distributing or maintaining version 1 of GCC, G<TT>++</TT>, or libg<TT>++</TT>.  GCC2
supports both ANSI and traditional C, as well as some GNU C extensions.
There are front ends for C<TT>++</TT> and Objective C too.

New front ends are being developed, but they are not yet part of GCC.  A
front end for Fortran is now in alpha test and is approaching completion,
and a front end for Ada (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is available via
anonymous FTP from <CODE>cs.nyu.edu</CODE> in <TT>`ftp/pub/gnat'</TT>, though it is
not yet stable.  Volunteers are also developing a Pascal front end.

For more information about GCC, see "GNU Software Available Now."

<LI>

<B>C Interpreter</B>

The FSF is working to add interpreter facilities to the GNU compiler and
debugger.  This task is partly finished.  The compiler now generates
byte code (for all supported languages, not just C) and another package
interprets it.

To make this work usable, we need to add features to GDB to dynamically
load the byte code.  We also would like C compiler support for compiling
just a specified few functions in a file.  Due to limited
resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should
contact <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<LI>

<B>Binutils</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

Steve Chamberlain, Per Bothner, and others at Cygnus Support have
rewritten the binary utilities (including the linker).  Version 2 is
based on the same Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library used by GDB.  All
the tools can be run on a host that differs from the target (e.g.
cross-linking is supported).  Various forms of COFF and other object
file formats are supported.  A tool can now deal with object files in
multiple formats simultaneously.  E.g., the linker can read object files
using many different formats, and write the output in yet another format.
The linker interprets a superset of the AT&#38;T Linker Command Language,
which allows general control over where segments are placed in memory.

<LI>

<B>GNU C Library</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

Roland McGrath continues work on the GNU C Library.  It now supports all
requirements of the ANSI C-1989 and POSIX 1003.1-1990 standards, most
facilities of POSIX 1003.2, and many additional BSD and System V functions.

The C Library will perform many functions of the Unix system calls in
the Hurd.  Mike Haertel has written a fast <CODE>malloc</CODE> which
wastes less memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU regular-expression
functions (<CODE>regex</CODE>) now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2
standard.

GNU <CODE>stdio</CODE> lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a
few C functions.  The <CODE>fmemopen</CODE> function uses this to open a
stream on a string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your
own <CODE>printf</CODE> formats to use a C function you have written.  For
example, you can safely use format strings from user input to implement
a <CODE>printf</CODE>-like function for another programming language.
Extended <CODE>getopt</CODE> functions are already used to parse options,
including long options, in many GNU utilities.

Version 1.06 of the GNU C Library is just out and 1.07 is in the works.
Version 1.06 includes the relocating allocator used in Emacs 19, as well as
new ports to Dynix on Sequent Symmetry, SCO &#38; SVR4 on i386, &#38; Solaris 2 on
SPARC.  Texinfo source of the <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> is
included.  For more info, see "GNU Software Available Now."

<LI>

<B>indent</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

We now have a version of <CODE>indent</CODE> which supports the GNU
indentation conventions for C code.  It is more robust and also has
handy options for the most common style combinations.

A companion program to examine a C source file and find the indentation
parameters used therein is almost ready for release, but needs someone to
finish it.  Please contact <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> to volunteer.

<LI>

<CODE>make</CODE>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> version 3.70 is released.  Error reporting is improved and
many bugs have been fixed.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> fully complies with the POSIX.2
standard.  It also supports long options, parallel command execution,
flexible implicit pattern rules, conditional execution and powerful text
manipulation functions.  Version 3.64 added support for the popular
<SAMP>`+='</SAMP> syntax for appending more text to a variable's definition.
For those with no vendor-supplied <CODE>make</CODE> utility at all, GNU
<CODE>make</CODE> comes with a shell script called <TT>`build.sh'</TT> for the
initial build.  See "GNU Software Available Now."

<LI>

<B>Oleo</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

Oleo is a spreadsheet program that can be run either as an X client or
using curses.  The current version is 1.5.  Support has recently been
added both for <CODE>gnuplot</CODE> and for generating embedded Postscript.

If you would like to write the Texinfo manual for Oleo, contact Tom Lord,
<CODE>lord+@andrew.cmu.edu</CODE>.  Please send bug reports regarding Oleo
to <CODE>bug-oleo@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.  See "GNU Software Available
Now."

<LI>

<B>Ghostscript</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

The current version of Ghostscript is 2.6.1.  New features include the
ability to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript
runs (X Window System and Microsoft Windows), resulting in much
better-looking screen displays; improved text file printing (like
<CODE>enscript</CODE>); a utility to extract the text from a Postscript
document; a much more reliable (and faster) Microsoft Windows
implementation; support for Microsoft C/C<TT>++</TT> 7.0; drivers for many
new printers, including the SPARCprinter, and for TIFF/F (fax) file
format; many more Postscript Level 2 facilities, including most of the
color space facilities (but not patterns), and the ability to switch
between Level 1 and Level 2 dynamically.

Ghostscript accepts commands in Postscript and executes them by writing
directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to a file that
you can print later (or to a bitmap file that you can manipulate with
other graphics programs).  Tim Theisen,
<CODE>ghostview@cs.wisc.edu</CODE>, has created Ghostview, a previewer
for multi-page files that runs on top of Ghostscript.  Russell Lang,
<CODE>rjl@monu1.cc.monash.edu.au</CODE>, has created Ghostview for
Windows, a similar previewer that runs on Microsoft Windows.

Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA, or SuperVGA graphics (but please do
<EM>not</EM> ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use PCs).

The next planned Ghostscript release is 3.0, hopefully available in early
1994.  It will implement the full Postscript Level 2 language except for
LZW compression, which can't be freely implemented because of software
patents.  Prohibitions like this on programming is what the
League for Programming Freedom is fighting.  See "What is the LPF?" for
details.

<LI>

<B>Smalltalk</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

GNU Smalltalk implements the traditional features of the Smalltalk
language, but not yet the graphics and window features.  Recently someone
implemented these and they will appear in a future release.

<LI>

<B><CODE>groff</CODE></B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

James Clark has completed <CODE>groff</CODE> (GNU <CODE>troff</CODE> and related
programs).  Written in C<TT>++</TT>, they can be compiled with GNU C<TT>++</TT>
Version 2.3 or later.

Bugs in <CODE>groff</CODE> will be fixed, but no major new developments are
currently planned.  However, <CODE>groff</CODE> users are encouraged to
continue to contribute enhancements.  Most needed are complete Texinfo
documentation, a <CODE>grap</CODE> emulation (a <CODE>pic</CODE> preprocessor for
typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar to <CODE>pm</CODE>
(see <CITE>Computing Systems</CITE>, Vol. 2, No. 2) and an ASCII output
class for <CODE>pic</CODE> so that <CODE>pic</CODE> can be integrated with Texinfo.

Thanks to all those who have contributed bug reports.

<LI>

<B>Texinfo 3</B>     (also see "GNU Software Available Now")

The Texinfo 3 package includes an enhanced Texinfo mode for GNU Emacs,
new versions of the formatting utilities, and the second edition of the
<CITE>Texinfo Manual</CITE>.  This edition is more thorough and describes over
50 new commands.  Texinfo mode now includes commands for automatically
creating and updating nodes and menus, a tedious task when done by hand.
<CODE>makeinfo</CODE>, a standalone formatter, and <CODE>info</CODE>, a standalone
Info reader are included.  Both are written in C and are independent of
GNU Emacs.

<LI>

<B>Porting</B>

Although we do not yet have a complete GNU system, it is already
possible for you to begin porting it.  This is because the unfinished
part, the Hurd, is basically portable.  The parts of the system that
really need porting are Mach and the GNU C Library, which are already
available to port, use and report bugs.

<H1><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="bull16.html#TOC35">GNU Documentation</A></H1>

<P>
GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use on-line and printed
documentation.
GNU manuals are intended to explain the underlying concepts, describe
how to use all the features of each program, and give examples of
command use.  GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which
yield both typeset hardcopy and on-line hypertext-like display via the
menu-driven Info system.  These manuals, source for which is provided
with our software, are also available in hardcopy; see the "Free
Software Foundation Order Form."

</P>
<P>
Several GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with <EM>lay-flat</EM>
bindings.  This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without
creasing the binding.  Each book has an inner cloth spine and an outer
cardboard cover that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback
will.
The other GNU manuals are also bound so they lie flat when opened, using
other technologies.  See the "Free Software Foundation Order Form" for a
list of each.

<UL>

<LI><CODE>acm</CODE>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<CODE>acm</CODE> is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that
runs under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat
against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.  Eventually we
hope to turn this into a more general purpose flight simulator.

<LI><B>Autoconf</B>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for a
package from a template file which lists the operating system features
which the package can use, in the form of <CODE>m4</CODE> macro calls.  Most GNU
programs now use Autoconf--generated configure scripts.

<LI><B>BASH</B>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

The GNU shell, BASH (<B>B</B>ourne <B>A</B>gain <B>SH</B>ell), is compatible with
the Unix <CODE>sh</CODE> and offers many extensions found in <CODE>csh</CODE> and
<CODE>ksh</CODE>.  BASH has job control, <CODE>csh</CODE>-style command history, and
command-line editing (with Emacs and <CODE>vi</CODE> modes built-in and the
ability to rebind keys) via the <B>readline</B> library.

<LI><B><CODE>bc</CODE></B>     (SrcCD, UtilT)

<CODE>bc</CODE> is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision.
GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> follows the POSIX 1003.2
draft
standard, with several extensions including multi-character variable names,
an <CODE>else</CODE> statement and full Boolean expressions.

<LI><B>BFD</B>     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The Binary File Descriptor library allows a program which operates on
object files (e.g. <CODE>ld</CODE> or GDB) to support many different formats
in a clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so that only BFD needs
to know the actual details of a particular format.  One consequence of this
design is that all programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out,
COFF, ELF &#38; OSF-Rose.  BFD comes with Texinfo documentation.

Presently BFD is not distributed separately but is included with packages
that use it, because it is not yet completely stable.

<LI><B>Binutils</B>     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The Binutils includes the programs:
<CODE>ar</CODE>,
<CODE>c<TT>++</TT>filt</CODE>,
<CODE>demangle</CODE>,
<CODE>gprof</CODE>,
<CODE>ld</CODE>,
<CODE>nlmconv</CODE>,
<CODE>nm</CODE>,
<CODE>objcopy</CODE>,
<CODE>objdump</CODE>,
<CODE>ranlib</CODE>,
<CODE>size</CODE>,
<CODE>strings</CODE>,
&#38;
<CODE>strip</CODE>.

Binutils Version 2 is completely rewritten to use the BFD library.
The GNU linker <CODE>ld</CODE> emits source-line numbered error messages for
multiply-defined symbols and undefined references.
<CODE>nlmconv</CODE> converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
The <CODE>objdump</CODE> program can disassemble code for a29k, ALPHA, H8/300,
H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS, SH, SPARC, &#38; Z8000
processors, and can display other data such as symbols and relocations from
any file format understood by BFD.  Also see "Project GNU Status Report".

<LI><B>Bison</B>     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCompT)

Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
<CODE>yacc</CODE>.  Sources for the <CITE>Bison Manual</CITE> and reference card are
included.

<LI><B>GNU C Library</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

The library supports ANSI C-1989 and POSIX 1003.1-1990 and has most of the
functions specified in POSIX 1003.2 draft 11.2.  It is upward compatible
with 4.4 BSD and includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

Version 1.07 uses a standard GNU <CODE>configure</CODE> script.  It runs on Sun-3
(SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 &#38; Solaris 2), HP 9000/300 (4.3 BSD), SONY
News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation (Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
i386/i486 (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2 &#38; SCO ODT 2.0) &#38; Sequent Symmetry
i386 (Dynix 3).  Texinfo source for the <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> is
included.  Also see "Project GNU Status Report".

<LI><B>Calc</B>     (EmcsT, SrcCD)

Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible,
advanced desk calculator and mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU
Emacs.  It comes with source for the <CITE>Calc Manual</CITE> and reference
card, which serves as a tutorial and reference.  If you wish, you can
use Calc just as a simple four-function calculator, but it provides
additional features including choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based)
entry, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and financial functions,
arbitrary precision, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, dates, times,
infinities, sets, algebraic simplification, differentiation, and
integration.  Calc also outputs to <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>.

<LI><B>GNU Chess</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU Chess is a program that plays chess with you.  It is written
entirely in the C language and has been ported to the PC, the Cray-2 &#38;
numerous other machines.  It has also been ported to other operating
systems, including Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS, though these versions are
not supported by the maintainer.  There are both text and X display
interfaces.

GNU Chess implements many specialized features including the null move
heuristic, a hash table with aging, the history heuristic (another form of
the earlier killer heuristic), caching of static evaluations, and a
sophisticated database which lets it play the first several moves in the
game quickly.

GNU Chess won the Uniform Platform event held in August 1992 in London,
England.  Nine programs competed, running on identical hardware.

GNU Chess is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft on behalf of
the
FSF.

<LI><B>CLISP</B>     (EmcsT, SrcCD)

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
It mostly supports the Common Lisp described by <CITE>Common LISP: The
Language (1st edition)</CITE>.  CLISP includes an interpreter, a byte-compiler
and, for some machines, a screen editor.  CLISP needs only 1.5 MB of
memory and runs on many microcomputers (including the Atari ST, Amiga
500-2000, most MS-DOS systems &#38; OS/2) &#38; on some Unix workstations
(Linux, SunOS (SPARC), Sun-386i, HP-UX (HP 9000/800) &#38; others).

<LI><B><CODE>cpio</CODE></B>     (UtilD, UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>cpio</CODE> is an alternative archive program with all the features of SVR4
<CODE>cpio</CODE>, including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 <CITE>ustar</CITE>
standard.  <CODE>mt</CODE> a program to position magnetic tapes is included with
<CODE>cpio</CODE>.

<LI><B>CVS</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

CVS, the Concurrent Version System, manages software revision and release
control in a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group environment.  It
works best in conjunction with RCS versions 4 and above, but will parse
older RCS formats with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See Berliner,
Brian, "CVS-II: Parallelizing Software Development," <CITE>Proceedings of
the Winter 1990 USENIX Association Conference</CITE>.

<LI><B><CODE>dc</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>dc</CODE> is an RPN calculator.  GNU <CODE>bc</CODE> does not require a separate
<CODE>dc</CODE> program to run.  This version of <CODE>dc</CODE> will eventually be
merged with GNU <CODE>bc</CODE>.

<LI><B>DejaGnu</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs that provides a single
front end for all tests.  The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu
framework make it easy to write tests for any program.  DejaGnu comes with
<CODE>expect</CODE> and Tcl.

<LI><B>Diffutils</B>     (UtilD, UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU <CODE>diff</CODE> compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.
The Diffutils distribution contains <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>diff3</CODE>,
<CODE>sdiff</CODE>, and <CODE>cmp</CODE>.

<LI><B>DJGPP</B>     (BinCD, DjgppD)

DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G<TT>++</TT> 2.5.7 to the i386 MS-DOS platform.  The
DJGPP package also contains a 32-bit 80386 DOS extender with symbolic
debugger; development libraries; and ports of Bison, <CODE>flex</CODE>, GAS, and
the GNU binary utilities.  Full source code is provided.

DJGPP supports SVGA (up to 1024x768),
XMS &#38; VDISK memory allocation,
<CODE>himem.sys</CODE>,
VCPI (e.g. QEMM, DESQview, &#38; 386MAX), and
DPMI (e.g. Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, &#38; QDPMI).

It is available via FTP from
<CODE>ftp.clarkson.edu</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/msdos/djgpp'</TT>.  You can
subscribe to a mailing list on DJGPP by sending your e-mail address to
<CODE>djgpp-request@sun.soe.clarkson.edu</CODE>.  In addition, the FSF
distributes it on floppy disks and on the Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM.

See the description for GCC in this section for more information.

<LI><B><CODE>dld</CODE></B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<CODE>dld</CODE> is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your
program with the <CODE>dld</CODE> library allows you to dynamically load object
files into the running binary.  Currently supported are VAX (Ultrix), Sun 3
(SunOS 3.4 and 4.0), SPARC (SunOS 4.0), Sequent Symmetry (Dynix), and Atari ST.

<LI><B><CODE>doschk</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

This program is intended as a utility to help software developers ensure
that their source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms with
14-character filenames and on MS-DOS with 11 character filenames.

<LI><B><CODE>ecc</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>ecc</CODE> is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking program, which can
correct three byte errors in a block of 255 bytes and detect more severe
errors.

<LI><B>Elib</B>     (EmcsT, SrcCD)

This is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

<LI><B><CODE>elvis</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>elvis</CODE> is a clone of the <CODE>vi</CODE>/<CODE>ex</CODE> Unix editor.  It
supports nearly all of the <CODE>vi</CODE>/<CODE>ex</CODE> commands in both visual and
line mode.  <CODE>elvis</CODE> runs under BSD, System V, Xenix, Minix, MS-DOS &#38;
Atari TOS, and should be easy to port to many other systems.

<LI><B>GNU Emacs 18</B>     (DemcsD, EmcsT, SrcCD, VMSEmcsT)

In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
customizable real-time display editor.  GNU Emacs is his second
implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated into the
editor--for writing extensions, and provides an interface to MIT's X
Window System.  In addition to its powerful native command set, extensions
which emulate other popular editors are distributed: vi, EDT (DEC's VMS
editor) and Gosling (aka Unipress) Emacs.  It has many other features which
make it a full computing support environment.  It is described by the
<CITE>GNU Emacs Manual</CITE>, the <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE> and a
reference card.  Source for all three come with the software.

GNU Emacs 18.59 runs on many Unix systems (in hardware order): Alliant

<LI><B>GNU Emacs 19</B>     (EmcsT, SrcCD)

Unlike some other recent derivations of Emacs,
GNU Emacs 19 continues to
work on character-only terminals as well as under the X Window System.  New
features in Emacs 19 include:
multiple X windows ("frames" to Emacs), with a separate X window
for the minibuffer or with a minibuffer attached to each X window;
property lists associated with regions of text in a buffer;
multiple fonts and colors defined by those properties;
simplified and improved processing of function keys, mouse clicks
and mouse movement;
X selection processing, including clipboard selections;
hooks to be run if point or mouse moves outside a certain range;
menu bars and popup menus defined by keymaps;
scrollbars;
before and after change hooks;
source-level debugging of Emacs Lisp programs;
European character sets support;
floating point numbers;
improved buffer allocation, using a new mechanism capable of
returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed;
interfacing with the X resource manager;
GNU configuration scheme support;
good RCS support;
&#38;
many updated libraries.

Other configurations supported by Emacs 18 should work with few
changes; as users tell us more about their experiences with different
systems, we will augment the list.  Also see "Project GNU Status Report".

<LI><B><CODE>es</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

This is an extensible shell based on <CODE>rc</CODE> that has
first class functions, lexical scope, an exception system, and
rich return values (i.e. functions can return values other than just
numbers).  Like <CODE>rc</CODE>, it is great for both interactive use and for
scripting, particularly because its quoting rules are much less baroque
than the C or Bourne shells.

<LI><B><CODE>expect</CODE></B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<CODE>expect</CODE> runs scripts to conduct dialogs with programs.  It is
distributed along with Tcl and DejaGnu.

<LI><B><CODE>f2c</CODE></B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<CODE>f2c</CODE> converts Fortran-77 source files into C or C<TT>++</TT>, which can
then be compiled with GCC.

<LI><B>Fax</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

Fax is the freely-available MIT AI Lab fax spooling system, which provides
Group 3 fax transmission and reception services for a networked Unix
system.  It requires a faxmodem which conforms to the new EIA-592
Asynchronous Facsimile DCE Control Standard, Service Class 2.

<LI><B>Fileutils</B>     (UtilD, UtilT, SrcCD)

Fileutils work on files:
<CODE>chgrp</CODE>,
<CODE>chmod</CODE>,
<CODE>chown</CODE>,
<CODE>cp</CODE>,
<CODE>dd</CODE>,
<CODE>df</CODE>,
<CODE>dir</CODE>,
<CODE>du</CODE>,
<CODE>install</CODE>,
<CODE>ln</CODE>,
<CODE>ls</CODE>,
<CODE>mkdir</CODE>,
<CODE>mkfifo</CODE>,
<CODE>mknod</CODE>,
<CODE>mv</CODE>,
<CODE>mvdir</CODE>,
<CODE>rm</CODE>,
<CODE>rmdir</CODE>,
<CODE>touch</CODE>,
&#38;
<CODE>vdir</CODE>.
Only some of these are on the Selected Utilities diskettes.

<LI><B><CODE>find</CODE></B>     (UtilD, UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>find</CODE> is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations on
them.  <CODE>xargs</CODE> and <CODE>locate</CODE> are also included.

<LI><B><CODE>finger</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU Finger, which serves as a direct replacement for existing finger
programs, solves this problem.  For sites with many hosts, a single host
may be designated as the finger <EM>server</EM> host.  This host collects
information about who is logged in to other hosts at that site.  If a user
at site A wants to know about users logged on at site B, a single
query to any machine at the site will return complete information.

<LI><B><CODE>flex</CODE></B>     (LangT, UtilD, SrcCD)

<CODE>flex</CODE> is a mostly-compatible replacement for the <CODE>lex</CODE> scanner
generator, written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
<CODE>flex</CODE> generates far more efficient scanners than <CODE>lex</CODE> does.
Sources for the <CITE>Flex Manual</CITE> and reference card are included.

<LI><B>Fontutils</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

The Fontutils can create fonts for use with Ghostscript or TeX, starting
with a scanned type image and converting the bitmaps to outlines.  They
also contain general conversion programs and other utilities.

<LI><B>GAS</B>     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

The GNU assembler has been rewritten to use the BFD library.
Native assembly works for:
Sun 3, 4, &#38; SPARC (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2);
i386 (AIX, 386BSD, BSDI/386, Linux);
m68k (BSD, HP-UX, Convergent Technologies SysV);
MIPS (Ultrix, Irix);
Hitachi H8/500; &#38;
VAX (BSD, Ultrix, VMS).

Cross assembling can be done for:
i386 (SCO, go32 MS-DOS/DJGPP);
ebmon29k;
Hitachi H8/300;
i960 (COFF);
MIPS ECOFF (Ultrix, Iris, MIPS Magnum);
Nindy 960;
vxworks (68k or 960); &#38;
Zilog Z8000.

<LI><B>GAWK</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

GAWK is upwardly compatible with the System V Release 4 version of
<CODE>awk</CODE>.  Texinfo source for the <CITE>GAWK Manual</CITE> comes with the
software.

<LI><B>GCC</B>     (BinCD, DjgppD, LangT, SrcCD)

Version 2 of the GNU C compiler supports three languages: C, C<TT>++</TT> and
Objective C; the source file name suffix or a compiler option selects
the language.  The front end support for Objective C was donated by NeXT.
The runtime support needed to run Objective C programs is now distributed
with GCC (this does not include any Objective C classes aside from
<CODE>object</CODE>).  As much as possible, G<TT>++</TT> is kept compatible with the
evolving draft ANSI standard, but not with <CODE>cfront</CODE> (AT&#38;T's
compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

The GNU C compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs
automatic register allocation, common sub-expression elimination, invariant
code motion from loops, induction variable optimizations, constant
propagation and copy propagation, delayed popping of function call
arguments, tail recursion elimination, integration of inline functions and
frame pointer elimination, instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling
of delay slots, leaf function optimization, optimized multiplication by
constants, a certain amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE)
between basic blocks (though not all of the supported machine descriptions
provide for scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes
to instructions, and many local optimizations that are automatically
deduced from the machine description.  Function-wide CSE has been written,
but needs to be cleaned up before it can be installed.
Position-independent code is supported on the 68k, i386, Hitachi Slt,
Hitachi H8/300, Clipper, 88k, SPARC &#38; SPARClite.

GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type <CODE>long long
int</CODE>).  It supports extended floating point (type <CODE>long double</CODE>) on
the 68k; other machines will follow.

GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C and GNU C extensions.  GNU C has
been extended to support nested functions, nonlocal gotos, and taking the
address of a label.

GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF &#38; OSF-Rose files when used with a
suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, &#38; DWARF.

GCC generates code for: a29k, Alpha, ARM, Convex cN, Clipper, Elxsi,
H8300, HP-PA (1.0 and 1.1) i370, i386, i486, i860, i960, m68k, m68020, m88k,
MIPS, ns32k, Pyramid, ROMP, RS6000, SH, SPARC, SPARClite, VAX, and we32k.

Operating systems supported include: AIX, ACIS, AOS, BSD, Clix, Ctix,
DG/UX, Dynix, Genix, HP-UX, ISC, Irix, Linux, Luna, LynxOS, Mach, Minix,
NeWSOS, OSF, OSF-Rose, RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2, SunOS 4, SysV, Ultrix, Unos,
&#38; VMS.

The old (version 1) machine descriptions for the Alliant, Tahoe and Spur
(as well as a new port for the Tron) do not work, but are still included in
the distribution in case someone wants to work on them.

Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
easy as building a compiler for the same target machine.  Version 2
supports more general calling conventions: it can pass arguments "by
reference" and can preallocate the space for stack arguments.  GCC 2 on
the SPARC uses the SPARC conventions for structure arguments and return
values.

Source for the GCC manual, <CITE>Using and Porting GNU CC</CITE>, is included
with the compiler.  The manual describes how to run and install the GNU C
compiler, and how to port it to new systems.  It describes new features and
incompatibilities of the compiler, but people not familiar with C will also
need a good reference on the C programming language.  Also see "Project
GNU Status Report".

<LI><B>GDB</B>     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

In GDB, object files and symbol tables are now read via the BFD library,
which allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs of multiple object file
formats such as a.out and COFF.  Other new features include command
language improvements, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and
watchpoints (breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression
changes).  Exception handling, SunOS shared libraries and C<TT>++</TT> multiple
inheritance are only supported when used with GCC version 2.

Both X and GNU Emacs user interfaces to GDB are available, in addition to
its command line interpreter.

GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so far)
contains simulators for the Zilog Z8001/2, the Hitachi H8/300, H8/500 &#38; Super-H.

GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB <EM>targets</EM> a platform
means that it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that
GDB can <EM>host</EM> a given platform means that it can be built on it, but
cannot necessarily debug native programs.  GDB can:


<UL>

<LI><EM>target</EM> &#38; <EM>host</EM>: DEC Alpha (OSF/1), Amiga 3000 (Amix),

DECstation 3100 &#38; 5000 (Ultrix), HP 9000/300 (BSD), IBM RS/6000 (AIX), i386
(BSD, SCO, Linux, LynxOS), Motorola Delta m88k (System V), NCR 3000 (SVR4),
SGI Iris (MIPS running Irix V3 &#38; V4), SONY News (NewsOS 3.x), Sun-3 &#38; SPARC
(SunOS 4.1, Solaris 2.0) &#38; Ultracomputer (29K running Sym1).

</UL>

In addition, GDB can use the symbol tables emitted by the compilers
supplied by most vendors of MIPS-based machines, including DEC.  (These
symbol tables are in a format which almost nobody else uses.)  Source for
the manual <CITE>Debugging with GDB</CITE> and a reference card are included.

<LI><B><CODE>gdbm</CODE></B>     (LangT, UtilD, SrcCD)

The <CODE>gdbm</CODE> library is the GNU replacement for the traditional
<CODE>dbm</CODE> and <CODE>ndbm</CODE> libraries.  It implements a database using quick
lookup by hashing.  <CODE>gdbm</CODE> does not need sparse file formats
(unlike its Unix counterparts).

<LI><B>Ghostscript</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

Ghostscript is GNU's graphics language which is almost fully compatible
with Postscript (see "Project GNU Status Report").

<LI><B>Ghostview</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<LI><B>GNATS</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

Gnats (<B>GN</B>ats: <B>A</B> <B>T</B>racking <B>S</B>ystem) is a bug-tracking system.
It is based upon the paradigm of a central site or organization which
receives problem reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic
mail.  Although it's been used primarily as a software bug-tracking system
so far, it is sufficiently generalized so that it could be used for
handling system administration issues, project management or any number of
other applications.

<LI><B><CODE>gnuplot</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>gnuplot</CODE> is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
expressions and data.  It handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces
(3 dimensions).  Curiously, the program was neither written nor named for
the GNU Project; the name is a coincidence.

<LI><B>GnuGo</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

GnuGo plays the game of Go (Wei-Chi); it is not yet very sophisticated.

<LI><B><CODE>gperf</CODE></B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

<CODE>gperf</CODE> is a "perfect" hash-table generation utility.  There are
actually two implementations of <CODE>gperf</CODE>, one written in C and one in
C<TT>++</TT>.  Both will produce hash functions in either C or C<TT>++</TT>.

<LI><B>GNU Graphics</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU Graphics is a set of programs which produce plots from ASCII or binary
data.  It supports output to Tektronix 4010, Postscript, and the X Window
System or compatible devices.  Features include support for output in ln03
and TekniCAD TDA file formats; a replacement for the <CODE>spline</CODE> program;
examples of shell scripts using <CODE>graph</CODE> and <CODE>plot</CODE>; a statistics
toolkit; and the use of <CODE>configure</CODE> for installation.

Existing ports need retesting.  Contact Rich Murphey,
<CODE>Rich@rice.edu</CODE>, if you can help test/port it to anything beyond
a SPARCstation.

<LI><B><CODE>grep</CODE></B>/<B><CODE>egrep</CODE></B>/<B><CODE>fgrep</CODE></B>     (UtilD, UtilT, SrcCD)

devices.  Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley <CODE>me</CODE>
macros and an enhanced version of the X11 <CODE>xditview</CODE> previewer.

<CODE>mgm</CODE> is a macro package for <CODE>groff</CODE>.  It is almost compatible
with the DWB <CODE>mm</CODE> macros and has several extensions.
Also see "Project GNU Status Report".

<LI><B><CODE>gzip</CODE></B>     (DjgppD, EmcsT, LangT, SrcCD, UtilT)

Some of the contents of our tape and FTP distributions are compressed.  We
have software on our tapes and FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with <CODE>compress</CODE>, we have switched to another
compression program, <CODE>gzip</CODE>.  <CODE>gzip</CODE> can expand LZW-compressed
files but uses a different algorithm for compression which generally
produces better results.  It also uncompresses files compressed with System
V's <CODE>pack</CODE> program.

<LI><B><CODE>hello</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

The GNU <CODE>hello</CODE> program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the GNU
General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

Like any truly useful program, <CODE>hello</CODE> provides a built-in mail
reader.

<LI><B><CODE>hp2xx</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU hp2xx reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and raster
output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently supported vector
formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex RGIP, Metafont and various
special TeX-related formats, and simplified HP-GL (line drawing only)
for imports.  Raster formats supported include IMG, PBM, PCX, &#38; HP-PCL
(including Deskjet &#38; DJ5xxC support).  Previewers work under X11 (Unix),
OS/2 (PM &#38; full screen), MS-DOS (SVGA, VGA, &#38; HGC).

<LI><CODE>indent</CODE>     (UtilD, UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU <CODE>indent</CODE> is a modified version of the freely-redistributable BSD
program of the same name.  It formats C source according to GNU coding

of our own extensions.  GNU extensions include long options, parallel
compilation, conditional execution and functions for text manipulation.
Texinfo source for the <CITE>Make Manual</CITE> comes with the program.

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> is on several of our tapes because some native
<CODE>make</CODE> programs lack the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> feature essential for using
the GNU configure system to its full extent.  A shell script is included to

Institutes of Health (NIH), using the C<TT>++</TT> programming language.

<LI>Octave     (LangT)

Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

Octave can do arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices, solve
sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions over finite and
infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary differential and
differential-algebraic equations.

Octave is available via anonymous ftp from <CODE>ftp.che.utexas.edu</CODE> in
the directory <TT>`/pub/octave'</TT>.  The files are in gzipped tar format
(see the file <TT>`README'</TT> on <CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu</CODE>).

The Octave distribution includes a 150+ page Texinfo manual.

<LI><B>Oleo</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<LI><B>GNU Shogi</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
captured pieces can be returned into play.

GNU Shogi has been created by modifying GNU Chess; GNU Shogi implements
the same features as GNU Chess and uses similar heuristics.  As a new
feature, sequences of partial board patterns can be introduced in order to
help the program play a good order of moves towards specific opening
patterns.  There is both a text and X
display interface.

GNU Shogi is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of FSF.

<LI><B>Smalltalk</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language system
written in portable C.  Features include an incremental garbage collector,
a binary image save capability, the ability to invoke user-written C code
and pass parameters to it, a GNU Emacs editing mode, optional byte-code
compilation tracing and byte-code execution tracing, and automatically
loaded per-user initialization files.
Also see "Project GNU Status Report".

<LI><B>superopt</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for a
given function.  You provide the GNU superoptimizer a function, a CPU to
generate code for, and how many instructions you can accept.  Its
application in GCC is described in the <CITE>ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92</CITE>
proceedings.  Superopt supports: SPARC, m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM RS/6000,
AMD 29000, Intel 80x86, Pyramid, DEC Alpha, &#38; HP-PA.

<LI><B><CODE>tar</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
special features that allow <CODE>tar</CODE> to be used for incremental and full
backups.  Unfortunately GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> implements an early draft of the
POSIX 1003.1 <CITE>ustar</CITE> standard which is different from the final
standard.  Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible
fashion is not trivial.

<LI><B>Termcap Library</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for <TT>`libtermcap.a'</TT> on
any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap
entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is source for the
<CITE>Termcap Manual</CITE> in Texinfo format.

<LI><B>TeX</B>     <EM>Not available from the FSF</EM>

TeX is document formatting system that handles complicated typesetting,
including mathematics.
It is the standard formatter for the GNU system.

We do not distribute TeX because you can get it from the University of
Washington, who serve as the center for maintenance of the Unix
version of TeX.

To order a full distribution written in <CODE>tar</CODE> on either a 1/4-inch

Please check with the above for current prices and formats.

<LI><B>Texinfo</B>     (EmcsT, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

Texinfo is a set of utilities which generate printed manuals and online
hypertext-style documentation (called "Info"), and provide means for
reading the online versions.  Version 3 contains both GNU Emacs Lisp and
standalone C programs, as well as source for the <CITE>Texinfo Manual</CITE>.
Also see "Project GNU Status Report".

<LI><B>Tcl</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

Tcl is an embeddable tool command language.
<CODE>expect</CODE> and DejaGnu work with and use Tcl.

<LI><B>Tile Forth</B>     (LangT, SrcCD)

Tile Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth--83 standard written in
C, allowing it to be easily moved between different computers
(traditionally, Forth implementations are written in assembler to use
the underlying hardware as optimally as possible, but this also makes
them less portable).

<LI><B><CODE>time</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>time</CODE> is used to report statistics (usually from a shell) about the
amount of user, system and real time used by a process.

<LI><B><CODE>tput</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>tput</CODE> is a portable way to allow shell scripts to use special
terminal capabilities.  GNU <CODE>tput</CODE> uses the Termcap database, rather
than Terminfo as most implementations do.

<LI><B>UUCP</B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

This version of UUCP was written by Ian Lance Taylor, and is the standard
UUCP system for GNU.  It currently supports the <CODE>f</CODE>, <CODE>g</CODE> (in all
window and packet sizes), <CODE>G</CODE>, <CODE>t</CODE> and <CODE>e</CODE> protocols, as
well a Zmodem protocol and two new bidirectional protocols.  If you have a
Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  If you have TLI
libraries, it can make TLI connections.

<LI><B><CODE>uuencode</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

Uuencode and uudecode are used to transmit binary files over
transmission mediums that do not support other than simple ASCII data.

<LI><B><CODE>wdiff</CODE></B>     (UtilT, SrcCD)

<CODE>wdiff</CODE> compares two files, finding which words have been deleted or
added to the first in order to obtain the second.  We hope eventually to
integrate it, as well as some ideas from a similar program called
<CODE>spiff</CODE>, into future releases of GNU <CODE>diff</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="bull16.html#TOC41">Contents of the Scheme Tape</A></H3>

<P>
Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed
at MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming, and
to research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

</P>
<P>
This tape contains MIT Scheme 7.1, which conforms to the
"Revised^4 Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
(MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source is included.
It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries which can be used to bootstrap Scheme are available for the
following systems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700 &#38; 800 running HP-UX 7.0 or 8.0

<LI>NeXT running NeXT OS 1.0 or 2.0

<LI>Sun-3 or Sun-4 running SunOS 4.1

<LI>DECstation 3100/5100 running Ultrix 4.0

<LI>Sony NWS-3250 running NEWS OS 5.01

<P>
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 5 of the MIT X Window System.
The first FSF tape contains all of the core software, documentation and
some contributed clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is
necessary for running X or running GNU Emacs under X.  The second,
"optional", FSF tape contains contributed libraries and other toolkits,
the Andrew User Interface System, games, and other programs.

</P>
<P>
The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released.

BSD software system except for a few utilities, some parts of the kernel
and some library routines which your own C library is likely to provide (we
have replacements on other tapes for many of the missing programs).  This

The CD-ROM also contains Texinfo source for the <CITE>GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</CITE> Edition 2.02 for version 19 and a snapshot of the Emacs
Lisp Archive at Ohio State University.  (You can get libraries in this
archive by UUCP (ask <CODE>staff@cis.ohio-state.edu</CODE> for directions)
or by anonymous FTP from <CODE>archive.cis.ohio-state.edu</CODE> in

</P>

<P>
The contents of the MIT Scheme, VMS, and Net2 tapes are not included

</P>
<P>
The CD-ROM is in ISO 9660 format and can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most operating systems.  If your driver supports it you can mount
the CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions and it will look just like an
ordinary Unix file system, rather than one full of truncated and otherwise
mangled names that fit the vanilla ISO 9660 specifications.

</P>
<P>
You can build most of this software without needing to copy the sources off
the CD.  Only sufficient disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets is required.  Except for the MIT Scheme binaries for MS-DOS and the
Ghostview for Windows executable, there are no precompiled programs on this
CD.  You will need a C compiler (programs which need some other interpreter
or compiler normally provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).

</P>
<P>
If a business is ultimately paying, the CD costs $400.  It costs $100 if
you, an individual, are paying out of your own pocket.

</P>


<UL>

<LI><B>What do the individual and company prices mean?</B>

The software on our disk is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the disk, we charge $400.  When an individual
buys the same disk, we charge just $100.

This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish, and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.

You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an
individual.  But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the
disk is really for the company, so please pay the company price and get
reimbursed for the company price.  We won't try to check up on you--we use
the honor system--so please cooperate.

Buying CDs at the company price is especially helpful for the GNU project;
just 80 CDs at the company price will support an FSF programmer or tech
writer for a year.

<LI><B>Why is there an individual price?</B>

In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $400 provides them with all of our software for a
much lower price than they would previously have paid for six different
tapes.  To lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very
badly.

However, for individuals, $400 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the
lower price of $100, but not do the same for companies.

<LI><B>Is there a maximum price?</B>

Our stated prices are minimums.  Feel free to pay a higher price if
you wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we
will accept as high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a
tax-deductible donation to the Free Software Foundation, which is a
tax-exempt public charity.

<P>
 


<H1><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="bull16.html#TOC47">Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM</A></H1>

<P>
We are now offering a CD-ROM that contains executables for GNU compiler
tools for some systems which lack a compiler.  This will allow users of
those systems to compile GNU and other free software without having to buy
a proprietary compiler.

</P>
<P>
The CD-ROM is in ISO 9660 format and can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most operating systems.  If your driver supports it you can mount
the CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions and it will look just like an
ordinary Unix file system, rather than one full of truncated and otherwise
mangled names that fit the vanilla ISO 9660 specifications.

</P>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="bull16.html#TOC48">Tape &#38; CD-ROM Subscription Service</A></H1>

<P>
If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest FSF developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent
to three tapes or CD-ROMs, we will mail you four new versions of the tape
of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.  The tapes are sent each quarter,
the Source Code CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued.  (The Source Code
CD-ROM is currently issued twice a year, but we may issue it more
frequently in the future.)

</P>
<P>
Regularly, we will send you a new version of an
Emacs, Languages, Utilities, or MIT X Window System Required tape or the
Source CD-ROM.  The BSD Net-2, MIT Scheme, and MIT X Window System Optional
tapes are not changed often enough to warrant quarterly updates.  The
Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM is so new we do not yet know if we will be
offering subscriptions to it.

</P>
<P>
Since Emacs 19 is now on the Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a
subscription to either will be a convenient way to keep current with Emacs
19 updates as it moves through beta-test.

</P>
<P>
A subscription is also an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to
the MIT X Window System.  We update the X11 Required tape, as fixes and
patches for the X Window System are issued throughout the year.  Each new
edition of the Source CD-ROM also has updated sources for the X Window
System.
See sections "Tape Subscriptions" and "CD-ROM Subscriptions" on the
"Free Software Foundation Order Form".

<H1><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="bull16.html#TOC49">How to Get GNU Software</A></H1>

<P>
All the software and publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  The easiest way to
get GNU software is to copy it from someone else who has it.
You can get GNU software direct from the FSF by ordering diskettes, a tape,
or a CD-ROM.  Such orders provide most of the funds for the FSF staff, so
please support our work by ordering if you can.  See the "Free Software
Foundation Order Form".

</P>
<P>
There are also third party groups who distribute our software; they do not
work with us, but can provide our software in other forms.  For your
convenience some are listed in "Free Software for Microcomputers".
Please note that the Free Software Foundation is <EM>not</EM> affiliated with
them in any way and is responsible for neither the currency of their
versions nor the swiftness of their responses.

</P>
<P>
If you decide to do business with one of these distributors, ask them how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g. by contributing
money to free software development projects or by writing free software
themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially
on this factor, you can help encourage those who profit from free software
to contribute to its growth.

</P>
<P>
If you have Internet access and cannot access one of the hosts below, you
can get the software via anonymous FTP from GNU's distribution host
<CODE>prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> (the IP address is <CODE>18.71.0.38</CODE>).  For
more information, get file <TT>`/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE'</TT>.
<CODE>prep</CODE> is a very busy host and only allows a limited number of FTP
logins at any given time.  Please use one of these other TCP/IP Internet
sites that also provide GNU software via anonymous FTP (program:
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, user: <CODE>anonymous</CODE>, password: <VAR>your e-mail
address</VAR>, mode: <CODE>binary</CODE>).

<B>GNU Software</B> <EM>not</EM> <B>on Apple computers</B>

In lawsuits, Apple claims the power to stop people from writing any program
that has a user interface that works even vaguely like the Macintosh's.  If
Apple wins in the courts, it will create for itself a new power over the
public that will enable it to put an end to free software.  So long as
Apple is committed to establishing this kind of monopoly, we will not
provide any support or software for Apple machines.  We ask that you too
refrain from developing for or porting to Apple systems, since any more
software adds to their business.  Don't feed the lawyer that bites you!

<B>Linux: a free Unix system for 386 machines</B>

Linux (named after its author, Linus Torvalds, and Minix) is a free Unix
clone which implements a subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  Linux
has been written from scratch and does not contain any proprietary code.
Many of the utilities and libraries are GNU Project software.  Linux runs
only on 386/486 AT-bus (and some EISA-bus) machines.  Porting to non-Intel
architectures is hard because the kernel makes extensive use of 386 memory
management and task primitives.  Linux is freely distributable and
available via anonymous FTP:
<CODE>tsx-11.mit.edu</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/linux'</TT> (USA),
<CODE>nic.funet.fi</CODE> in <TT>`/pub/OS/Linux'</TT> (Europe).  Ask

<B>Demacs, GNU Emacs for MS-DOS</B>

Manabu Higashida and Hirano Satoshi have released Demacs, a GNU
Emacs port for 386/486 MS-DOS.  Version 1.2.0 is the first post-beta
release.  Demacs provides several DOS-specific features: support for binary
or text file translation, "8 bit clean" display mode, 80x86 software
interrupt calls via an <CODE>int86</CODE> Lisp function, machine-specific
features such as function key support, file name completion with drive
name, child processes (<CODE>suspend-emacs</CODE> and <CODE>call-process</CODE>).
Dired mode works without <TT>`ls.exe'</TT>.  Anonymous FTP it from:
