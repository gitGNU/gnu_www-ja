<h2>FSF Bulletin Issue 2, June 2003</h2>

<h3 id="FromExecutiveDirector">From the Executive Director</h3>
<p>
by Bradley M. Kuhn</p>

<p>
I am happy to report some early success of our associate membership
program.  As of May 2003, there are 1,152 paid associate members.
Your dues are helping us to carry out the core work we do for the Free
Software Movement.  We are particularly thankful for those who,
through your blogs and Slashdot posts, have helped to inspire you
friends and colleagues to join the Foundation.</p>
<p>
Last issue, I wrote about the excitement of Eldred v. Ashcroft, a
Supreme Court case, in which we filed an amicus brief, that was poised
to decide the future of the commons and the extent and limits of
copyright law.  I am sad to report that despite Professor Lessig's and
Moglen's arduous and valiant efforts, the Court decided that Disney
matters more than the freedom of the public.  This battle rages on,
and we are now sure that the cause of freedom faces an uphill battle
with the federal government.  In this issue, you'll read about
possible FCC action that will serve to regulate the future of Free
Software.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, matters of software freedom in our community remain on our
minds.  We have this year already opened dozens of confirmed GPL
violation cases reported to us from the community; we continue
diligently in our enforcement efforts.  The cost of these efforts
increases each quarter.  Since nearly all of the resources of the
Compliance Lab are used to bring companies into compliance, we have
begun to ask corporations, through our GPL Compliance and Corporate
Patron Programs, to fund this activity.</p>
<p>
Since last summer, GNU Press has shipped nearly 2,500 copies of RMS'
book, <i>Free Software, Free Society</i> around the world.  That title
is now our top-selling book, and we are excited that we have been able
to educate the world about software freedom through our press
activity.</p>
<p>
Finally, we are ever vigilant in our efforts to fight co-opting of the
Free Software Movement.  We see a rising popularity of proprietary
software in Free Software environments. Our goal remains to build a
world where all published software is Free Software.  In particular,
we have put some additional resources into
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org" >savannah.gnu.org</a>.  It is not
only ironic but lamentable that the primary site used for Free
Software development, sourceforge.net, runs mostly proprietary
software.  Our hope is to provide more development resources for the
community that allow freedom to thrive.  Your support is essential to
that endeavor.</p>

<h3 id="SuperDMCA">The State Super-DMCA Fight</h3>

<p>by David &ldquo;Novalis&rdquo; Turner</p>

<p>
The MPAA and cable television companies have proposed Draconian new
technology control regulations in several states; yours could be next.
Their propaganda says these regulations are simply to stop theft of
cable services; but that's already illegal.  In fact, the laws are
more akin to the reviled Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  The
digital freedom community has been calling them
&ldquo;super-DMCAs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
The original MPAA model bill (introduced more-or-less without change
in Massachusetts and Texas) prohibits receiving (or doing almost
anything else with) communication services without the express consent
of the communication service provider.  And just about everything
counts as a communication service.  This means that you can't use a
radio or television without permission from the broadcasters.  Nobody
is going to tell you that you can't watch TV, but they might tell you
that you can't record it, a right the US Supreme Court affirmed in
1984.  They might tell you that you can't use your Free Software PVR
to pause it while you answer the phone. The Motion Picture Association
of America, primarily through its Copyright Protection Working Group,
has already said that it wants to limit these sorts of freedoms.</p>
<p>
Although I'm too young to remember it, I'm told that people used to be
required to rent phones from the phone company.  People would get in
trouble for using third party phones, and had to pay for each
extension.  If TV and radio broadcasters have their way, you may have
to rent your radio, TV, and VCR from them, or only use
&ldquo;authorized&rdquo; equipment.  And this equipment won't have a
record button.</p>
<p>
Many of these bills also prohibit anonymous communication, which is a
constitutional right.  Abuse survivors, human rights workers, and
whistleblowers depend on anonymization technology like Mixminion (a
Free Software program) to communicate securely.  Mixminion's
developers have been actively opposing the Massachusetts bill.</p>
<p>
In March, the Massachusetts super-DMCA, HB 2743, had a public hearing
before the joint committee for Criminal Justice.  I organized
cryptographers to oppose the bill, and many others came down on their
own.  In all, twenty people testified against the bill.  Only one
person, a lobbyist from the MPAA, testified in support.  The bill is
now effectively dead.  In Colorado, activists convinced the governor
to veto the bill.  In Oregon, letters to the bill's sponsor convinced
him to withdraw it.</p>
<p>
The battles in other states have been much harder.  In Tennessee, I
helped organize various GNU/Linux user groups to oppose SB 213 and HB
457.  Activists there have now formed the <a href="http://tndf.net">
Tennessee Digital Freedom Network (TNDF)</a>.  TNDF has shown up at
many hearings only to have them deferred.  All rules have been
suspended in the Tennessee legislature now, so bills can be debated
with little warning.  Many members of TNDF have to take off work or
school on short notice.  Despite these heroic efforts, the bills have
made it out of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, and on to
still more committees.  The fight continues.</p>
<p>
The MPAA and cable industries have fought hard to pass these bills.
In Texas, normal rules were suspended, and on a few hours notice,
activists had to show up at the state house, only to wait for seven
hours.  The bill was finally discussed after midnight.  In Tennessee,
every time a company, university, or consortium was recruited to
oppose the bill, a special exception was proposed to pacify them,
while not helping consumers at all.</p>
<p>
You can help fight these bills.  First, check out whether a bill like
this has been introduced in your state.  Professor Ed Felten maintains
a list at <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/tags/super-dmca">
freedom-to-tinker.com/tags/super-dmca</a>.  If your state isn't listed
there, check the legislature's web site to make sure it hasn't been
introduced since Felten's site has been updated.  If there is a bill,
go to any public hearings.  Bring friends from your local digital
freedom group, GNU/Linux users group, or university.  Be prepared to
answer questions about the details of the bill, but plan to speak for
only a few minutes.  Don't read from written text &mdash; you can
usually simply submit a written statement, which the legislators can
read at leisure.</p>
<p>
Preemptive activism is useful too.  Even if there's no bill in your
state, you can set up an appointment with your state senator or
representative.  The MPAA has vowed to introduce the bill in all fifty
states, so your legislators will see the bill eventually.</p>
<p>
When we first started fighting the super-DMCA laws, they looked
unstoppable.  The MPAA and cable industry groups have more money than
all of the digital freedom groups put together.  They can fly in
consultants to public hearings in every state.  But legislators have
shown that they can tell paid lobbyists from genuinely concerned
citizens.  Your views can be heard.</p>

<h3 id="FreeSoftwareMatters">Free Software Matters: Free Software
and the Broadcast Media</h3>
<p>by Eben Moglen</p>
<p>
Just as free software has been a particularly scary subject for the
music and film industries in the past several years, threatening their
control over their content, it is about to become excessively
frightening to their television and radio lordships as well.</p>
<p>
Here in the United States we are awaiting rule-making by the Federal
Communications Commission concerning the possibility of copy
protection for digital television content.  In 1996, Congress
legislated a ten-year plan for the conversion of the US broadcasting
system to a digital TV standard.  Every owner of an existing analog
television station was given, at no cost, an additional place on the
spectrum for a second, digital broadcast operation.  When, in 2006,
every station in the US is supposed to be fully operational in digital
broadcast, the operators are supposed to return to the public their
original analog television spectrum locations.</p>
<p>
But, although many broadcasters have made the expensive investments in
the digital broadcast chain, from the cameras through the studio
equipment to the transmitters, Americans have shown a predictable
unwillingness to replace all their inexpensive TV sets with new
digital sets that cost on the average ten times as much.  Their
reluctance has been understandable in part because Hollywood has not
made available all the supposedly smashing dramatic and sexy content
that was supposed to make watching digital television such a wonderful
experience.</p>
<p>
As usual, the reason has been concern from the content moguls that
their digital content would leak out into the world in the form of
perfect copies for peer-to-peer sharing.  A long round of
inter-industry negotiations last year concluded with a proposal for a
&ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; in digital content, which all hardware
that handles digital video is supposed to recognize, and treat as an
instruction not to permit copying of the attached content.</p>
<p>
Having reached this supposedly &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; (largely by
ignoring the objections of consumers, librarians, and other
representatives of the users of video content and the general public),
the content industries and the broadcasters have lobbied the Federal
Communications Commission to make administrative rules requiring
manufacturers of consumer TV equipment (which in this context means
everything from digital tuners, digital video recorders, and even
digital television displays themselves) to treat as uncopyable all
data streams with the &ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; turned on.</p>
<p>
Enter, as so often, free software.  After all, digital TV is just a
bitstream that a general purpose computer equipped with an antenna can
take out of the air and decode.  One can write for oneself a program
that will perform that task, and which will do so without paying any
special attention to the &ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo;.  Such a program
is <a href="/software/gnuradio/">GNU Radio</a>, a development project
of the Free Software Foundation.  GNU Radio can already receive and
decode US-standard digital television signals.  Thus, as the FCC
considers the order for special-interest regulation handed to it by
the Masters of MegaMedia, GNU Radio is going to cause quite a
headache.  The FCC is accustomed to telling the manufacturers of TV
sets how they should work, but whether it has the authority (or the
imprudence) to attempt to control software running on ordinary
personal computers is entirely uncertain.  If the FCC attempts to
implement broadcast copy protection, in other words, it will have to
attempt to control the free software movement.  If it does not risk an
extension of its authority into the domain of ordinary software, the
&ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; favor it is being asked to do for
Hollywood will be worthless.</p>
<p>
So my colleagues and I are currently urging the FCC to reconsider the
&ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; proposal.  If they don't, the stage is
set for a confrontation between the free software movement and the
media industries over GNU Radio, and the idea of
&ldquo;software-controlled radio&rdquo; overall.  That confrontation
would test the power of the FCC to make rules governing ordinary
computer software, and would raise very substantial freedom of speech
issues, because the Commission would be trying to limit the
distribution of general technical information.  The next few months
will tell whether the FCC is prepared to take on that challenge.  The
Free Software Foundation and the developers of GNU Radio certainly
stand ready to challenge any regulation that prohibits the
distribution of our software.  Because GNU Radio is free software that
any user has the right to understand and to modify, when GNU Radio is
configured to receive broadcast digital TV, a user could modify the
program to ignore the copy-protection &mdash; in the form of the
so-called &ldquo;broadcast flag&rdquo; &mdash; under consideration by
the FCC.</p>
<p>
But GNU Radio's role in challenging Hollywood's preferred form of
&ldquo;content protection&rdquo; for digital TV is just the beginning.
In a much larger sense, over the next decade, free software will be an
inherent part of a rebellion against the way the electromagnetic
spectrum is managed throughout the world.</p>
<p>
Since the late 1920s, governments everywhere have controlled the
electromagnetic spectrum under conceptions of
&ldquo;stewardship,&rdquo; &ldquo;public trust,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;public ownership&rdquo;.  In some countries this has meant
government exercising complete control over broadcast media, in others
government has &ldquo;licensed&rdquo; a few favored private parties to
make exclusive use of particular frequencies.  Some mix of
government-controlled and private broadcasting has been the norm in
many societies, as it has been in Great Britain for the last
generation.</p>
<p>
All these arrangements have been predicated on two basic principles:
that the electromagnetic spectrum is inherently a public resource
ultimately owned by the people as a whole, and that technical factors
require government to control the use of the spectrum in order to
prevent what the economist Garrett Hardin famously called &ldquo;the
tragedy of the commons&rdquo;.  If everyone were free to use all
frequencies of the spectrum however he or she liked, interference
would frustrate everyone's attempts.  So, in the interests of the
public, governments have given exclusive control over some frequencies
to individuals and organizations, called &ldquo;broadcasters&rdquo;,
who have acquired enormous social influence and power as a result of
their ownership of the means of mass communication.</p>
<p>
But the technical basis on which this system of broadcasting rests has
grown shaky.  The modern cellphone is an example of a device that
shares the electromagnetic spectrum with tens of thousands of other
similar devices, without creating the cacophony associated with
unregulated broadcasting.  &ldquo;Wi-fi&rdquo; data communications,
capable of carrying voice and video signals as well as every other
form of digital information, are similarly arranged around spectrum
sharing.  These are early examples of the twenty-first century
approach to the electromagnetic spectrum, in which frequencies are
optimally employed by being shared &mdash; used simultaneously by
intelligent devices for all sorts of one-to-one, one-to-many and
many-to-many communications &mdash; not by being exclusively
&ldquo;licensed&rdquo; to a few &ldquo;broadcasters&rdquo; who gain
the power to communicate with millions while everyone else merely
watches or listens.  Although there are new, more efficient, and more
democratic ways of using the public airwaves, governments remain in
control of spectrum, assertedly on their citizens' behalf, and
governments either themselves control broadcasting, or &mdash; as in
the United States &mdash; are dependent for their political success on
the broadcasters they have licensed.  As a result, the power of the de
facto owners of spectrum is maintained by the power of the State.</p>
<p>
But &ldquo;software-controlled radios&rdquo;, transmitters and
receivers whose selection of frequencies and communications protocols
are implemented in software, are going to become ubiquitous in the
next decade; again, the cellphone is a familiar early example.  And if
the software in software-controlled radios is free software, users
gain the ability to modify for themselves the rules about how spectrum
is employed.</p>
<p>
Could collectives of citizens &ldquo;homestead&rdquo; the spectrum,
using free software and slightly modified transmitting and receiving
hardware?  Communications regulators in several countries are
beginning to worry that they will soon be able to do just that.
Broadcasters, already losing eyeball-share to &ldquo;the
Internet&rdquo;, are one constituency stimulating their worry.  Badly
battered telecommunications companies are another.  If public wireless
networks controlled by their users begin carrying significant amounts
of voice and data traffic now carried over phone lines, local
telephone service monopolies will be subjected to competition from a
medium that is completely free.</p>
<p>
So regulators are going to face increasing calls to prevent free
software from running software-controlled radios, in the interest of
preventing the public from using the public airwaves in the ways the
public actually wants.  Agencies that have traditionally controlled
telephones and radio receivers are going to be attempting to control
every general-purpose computer, and the software that runs on it.
Free software is going to stand not only for free content, but also
for free spectrum, and with it, free bandwidth.  The same sort of
challenge to their control that the content industries were facing in
2002, the bandwidth industries, both broadcasting and
telecommunications, with all their power and their allies in
government, are going to be facing long before 2012.  A movement that
originally seemed primarily a new kind of competitor for the PC
software monopoly, and then became a threat to the sanctity of
cultural ownership by Disney and other &ldquo;content&rdquo;
companies, will soon be challenging the social control of bandwidth
and the power of the broadcasters.  Once again, when it comes to free
speech, free software matters.</p>

<h3 id="GPLCompliance">The GNU GPL Compliance Program</h3>
<p>FSF is responsible for creating the GNU General Public License (GNU
GPL) in 1989 and updating it thereafter.  The GPL is the most commonly
used Free Software license.  Through the GNU GPL Compliance Lab, we
diligently work to ensure the protection of Free Software.</p>
<p>
The Compliance Lab has been an informal activity of FSF since 1992 and
was formalized in December 2001.  One of its main functions is to
provide general &ldquo;knowledge infrastructure&rdquo; concerning the
GNU GPL and Free Software licensing.  Our new GNU GPL Compliance
Program provides companies with consultation on software development,
license compliance, legal matters and software certification through a
paid annual program.  Currently over 28 corporations have access to
consultation provided by the Compliance Program.</p>
<p>
The annual program fee helps us to sustain the service in perpetuity,
