     The GNU General Public License for Developers and Businesspeople
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial gives a section-by-section explanation of the most popular
Free Software copyright license, the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL),
and teaches software developers, managers and businesspeople how to use
the GPL and GPL'ed software successfully in new Free Software business and
in existing, successful enterprises.

Attendees should have a general familiarity with software development
processes.  A vague understanding of how copyright law applies to software
is also helpful.  The tutorial is of most interest to software developers
and managers who run software businesses that modify and/or redistribute
software under terms of the GNU GPL (or who wish to do so in the future),
and those who wish to make use of existing GPL'ed software in their
enterprise.

This is not a legal tutorial.  By contrast, it explains the GNU GPL to
professionals who are not well versed in the details of copyright law.
Presented by a software developer and manager, this tutorial informs
non-lawyers who wish to have a deeper understanding of how the GNU GPL
uses copyright law to protect software freedom and to assist in the
formation of Free Software businesses.

Upon completion of the tutorial, successful attendees can expect to have
learned:

    * the freedom-defending purpose of each term of the GNU GPL

    * the redistribution options under the GPL

    * the obligations when modifying GPL'ed software

    * how to properly apply the GPL to a new software

    * how to build a plan for proper and successful compliance with the GPL

    * the business advantages that the GPL provides

    * the most common business models used in conjunction with the GPL

    * how existing GPL'ed software can be used in existing enterprises
 
This tutorial takes approximately six hours, including time for two
fifteen minute breaks and questions.  An abbreviated three hour version
that covers some topics is also an option.
