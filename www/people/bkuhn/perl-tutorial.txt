                           Introduction to Perl
                      A Tutorial by Bradley M. Kuhn

This tutorial is an introduction to the Perl programming language for
programmers.  Students should already be familiar with the basic concepts
of scripting and/or programming, and with a text editor.  No prerequisite
knowledge of Perl is assumed; this course is for beginners.

This tutorial provides a "jump-start" so that students can continue
learning Perl at their own pace later.  The basic data types of Perl
(scalar, array and hash) are introduced and explained.  The basic control
structures used in Perl, as well as simple file input and output are
presented.  A brief introduction to regular expressions, as used in Perl,
is given.

The tutorial centers around a single, running example.  The students are
shown how a useful Perl program can be written with an absolute minimum of
knowledge about Perl, and how that program can be improved over time as
they learn more Perl.

Typically, this is a half-day tutorial, but can be shorten or extended as
needed.
