<a href="http://www.rattlesnake.com/">Robert J. Chassell</a> was a
founding Director and Treasurer of the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.  The FSF was
founded to support the GNU Project which restarted the movement
towards free software and open sources.  The GNU/Linux operating
system and associated applications are the outcome of these efforts by
the Foundation.  Chassell writes and edits.  He is the author of

economic history.

software to audiences who have little or no previous experience with
the technology. </p>

<p>

</p>

<li>He can explain how your legal rights to copy, study, modify, and

profitably.</li>

<li>He can describe the way freedom shapes the technology of software to
make it accessible and empowering for both programmers and users.</li>

<li>He can discuss the various business models used by companies to make
    profits with free software, both in rich and poor countries.</li>

<li>He can speak on the ethical implications of free and restricted
    software, and how to arrange matters such that acting in a cooperative
    and law abiding manner is without doubt the best action, for legal,
    moral, and practical reasons.</li>

<li>He can walk an audience of lawyers, and others who enjoy legal
    discussion, through the GNU General Public License paragraph by
    paragraph, and compare that license with other, somewhat different
    licenses.</li>

<li>From his own experience, he can describe the history of free software
    from its beginning in the GNU Project through the rise of the
    phrase <a href="/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">"open
    source"</a> to
    the present flowering of GNU/Linux.</li>

<h3><a id="becoming-speaker">Becoming a speaker</a></h3>
</div>
<p>
If you have been working for some time in the free software movement
and you would like to become a speaker, here are some suggestions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully read the materials in the <a href="/philosophy/philosophy.html">philosophy</a>, <a href="/gnu/gnu.html">gnu</a>, and <a href="/licenses/licenses.html">licenses</a> directories.
</li>


<li>Arrange some opportunities to give speeches, perhaps to local
organizations in your area.
</li>

<li>When you feel you are ready, record a speech
and <a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">email us</a> to send us the
recording.  We'll then give you feedback and perhaps decide to list
you as a speaker.
</li>

<li>
If you are not an experienced public speaker already, Toastmasters
International is useful for practicing and learning about speaking.
You may not want to pay too much attention to their merit badges and
degrees, unless you find them important to motivate you.  The
important thing they offer is practice and feedback.
</li>
</ul>
