<h3>Parameter Conventions</h3>

<p>When a GMP variable is used as a function parameter, it's effectively a
call-by-reference, meaning if the function stores a value there it will change
the original in the caller.  Parameters which are input-only can be designated
<code>const</code> to provoke a compiler error or warning on attempting to modify
them.

<p>When a function is going to return a GMP result, it should designate a
parameter that it sets, like the library functions do.  More than one value
can be returned by having more than one output parameter, again like the
library functions.  A <code>return</code> of an <code>mpz_t</code> etc doesn't return the
object, only a pointer, and this is almost certainly not what's wanted.

<p>Here's an example accepting an <code>mpz_t</code> parameter, doing a calculation,
and storing the result to the indicated parameter.

<br><pre>void
foo (mpz_t result, const mpz_t param, unsigned long n)
{
  unsigned long  i;
  mpz_mul_ui (result, param, n);
  for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++)
    mpz_add_ui (result, result, i*7);
}

int
main (void)
{
  mpz_t  r, n;
  mpz_init (r);
  mpz_init_set_str (n, "123456", 0);
  foo (r, n, 20L);
  gmp_printf ("%Zd\n", r);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p><code>foo</code> works even if the mainline passes the same variable for
<code>param</code> and <code>result</code>, just like the library functions.  But
sometimes it's tricky to make that work, and an application might not want to
bother supporting that sort of thing.

<p>For interest, the GMP types <code>mpz_t</code> etc are implemented as one-element
arrays of certain structures.  This is why declaring a variable creates an
object with the fields GMP needs, but then using it as a parameter passes a
pointer to the object.  Note that the actual fields in each <code>mpz_t</code> etc
are for internal use only and should not be accessed directly by code that
expects to be compatible with future GMP releases.
