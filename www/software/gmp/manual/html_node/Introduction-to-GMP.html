<h2>Introduction to GNU MP</h2>

<p>GNU MP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic
on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.  It aims to provide
the fastest possible arithmetic for all applications that need higher
precision than is directly supported by the basic C types.

<p>Many applications use just a few hundred bits of precision; but some
applications may need thousands or even millions of bits.  GMP is designed to
give good performance for both, by choosing algorithms based on the sizes of
the operands, and by carefully keeping the overhead at a minimum.

<p>The speed of GMP is achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type,
by using sophisticated algorithms, by including carefully optimized assembly
code for the most common inner loops for many different CPUs, and by a general
emphasis on speed (as opposed to simplicity or elegance).

<p>There is carefully optimized assembly code for these CPUs:
ARM,
DEC Alpha 21064, 21164, and 21264,
AMD 29000,
AMD K6, K6-2 and Athlon,
Hitachi SuperH and SH-2,
HPPA 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0,
Intel Pentium, Pentium Pro/II/III, Pentium 4, generic x86,
Intel IA-64, i960,
Motorola MC68000, MC68020, MC88100, and MC88110,
Motorola/IBM PowerPC 32 and 64,
National NS32000,
IBM POWER,
MIPS R3000, R4000,
SPARCv7, SuperSPARC, generic SPARCv8, UltraSPARC,
DEC VAX,
and
Zilog Z8000. 
Some optimizations also for
Cray vector systems,
Clipper,
IBM ROMP (RT),
and
Pyramid AP/XP.

<p>There is a mailing list for GMP users.  To join it, send a mail to
<a href="mailto:gmp-request@swox.com">gmp-request@swox.com</a> with the word <code>subscribe</code> in the message
<strong>body</strong> (not in the subject line).

<h3>How to use this Manual</h3>

<p>Everyone should read <a href="GMP-Basics.html#GMP%20Basics">GMP Basics</a>.  If you need to install the library
yourself, then read <a href="Installing-GMP.html#Installing%20GMP">Installing GMP</a>.  If you have a system with multiple
ABIs, then read <a href="ABI-and-ISA.html#ABI%20and%20ISA">ABI and ISA</a>, for the compiler options that must be used
on applications.

<p>The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it is
probably a good idea to glance through it.
