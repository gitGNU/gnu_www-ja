<h4>Perfect Power</h4>

<p>Detecting perfect powers is required by some factorization algorithms. 
Currently <code>mpz_perfect_power_p</code> is implemented using repeated Nth root
extractions, though naturally only prime roots need to be considered. 
(See <a href="Nth-Root-Algorithm.html#Nth%20Root%20Algorithm">Nth Root Algorithm</a>.)

<p>If a prime divisor p with multiplicity e can be found, then only
roots which are divisors of e need to be considered, much reducing the
work necessary.  To this end divisibility by a set of small primes is checked.
