Set an initial seed value into <var>state</var>.

<p>The size of a seed determines how many different sequences of random numbers
that it's possible to generate.  The "quality" of the seed is the randomness
of a given seed compared to the previous seed used, and this affects the
randomness of separate number sequences.  The method for choosing a seed is
critical if the generated numbers are to be used for important applications,
such as generating cryptographic keys.

<p>Traditionally the system time has been used to seed, but care needs to be
taken with this.  If an application seeds often and the resolution of the
system clock is low, then the same sequence of numbers might be repeated. 
Also, the system time is quite easy to guess, so if unpredictability is
required then it should definitely not be the only source for the seed value. 
On some systems there's a special device <code>/dev/random</code> which provides
random data better suited for use as a seed.
