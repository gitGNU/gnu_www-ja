<h4>Karatsuba Multiplication</h4>

<p>The Karatsuba multiplication algorithm is described in Knuth section 4.3.3
part A, and various other textbooks.  A brief description is given here.

<p>The inputs x and y are treated as each split into two parts of
equal length (or the most significant part one limb shorter if N is odd).

<br><pre> high              low
+----------+----------+
|    x1    |    x0    |
+----------+----------+

+----------+----------+
|    y1    |    y0    |
+----------+----------+
</pre>

<p>Let b be the power of 2 where the split occurs, ie. if x0 is
k limbs (y0 the same) then
b=2^(k*mp_bits_per_limb). 
With that x=x1*b+x0 and y=y1*b+y0, and the
following holds,

<br><pre>x*y = (b^2+b)*x1*y1 - b*(x1-x0)*(y1-y0) + (b+1)*x0*y0
</pre>

<p>This formula means doing only three multiplies of (N/2)x(N/2) limbs,
whereas a basecase multiply of NxN limbs is equivalent to four
multiplies of (N/2)x(N/2).  The factors (b^2+b) etc represent
the positions where the three products must be added.

<br><pre> high                              low
+--------+--------+ +--------+--------+
|      x1*y1      | |      x0*y0      |
+--------+--------+ +--------+--------+
          +--------+--------+
      add |      x1*y1      |
          +--------+--------+
          +--------+--------+
      add |      x0*y0      |
          +--------+--------+
          +--------+--------+
      sub | (x1-x0)*(y1-y0) |
          +--------+--------+
</pre>

<p>The term (x1-x0)*(y1-y0) is best calculated as an
absolute value, and the sign used to choose to add or subtract.  Notice the
sum high(x0*y0)+low(x1*y1) occurs twice, so it's possible to do 5*k limb
additions, rather than 6*k, but in GMP extra function call overheads
outweigh the saving.

<p>Squaring is similar to multiplying, but with x=y the formula reduces to
an equivalent with three squares,

<br><pre>x^2 = (b^2+b)*x1^2 - b*(x1-x0)^2 + (b+1)*x0^2
</pre>

<p>The final result is accumulated from those three squares the same way as for
the three multiplies above.  The middle term (x1-x0)^2 is now
always positive.

<p>A similar formula for both multiplying and squaring can be constructed with a
middle term (x1+x0)*(y1+y0).  But those sums can exceed
k limbs, leading to more carry handling and additions than the form
above.

<p>Karatsuba multiplication is asymptotically an O(N^1.585) algorithm,
the exponent being log(3)/log(2), representing 3 multiplies
each 1/2 the size of the inputs.  This is a big improvement over the basecase
multiply at O(N^2) and the advantage soon overcomes the extra additions
Karatsuba performs.

<p><code>MUL_KARATSUBA_THRESHOLD</code> can be as little as 10 limbs.  The <code>SQR</code>
threshold is usually about twice the <code>MUL</code>.  The basecase algorithm will
take a time of the form M(N) = a*N^2 + b*N + c and
the Karatsuba algorithm K(N) = 3*M(N/2) + d*N +
e.  Clearly per-crossproduct speedups in the basecase code reduce a
and decrease the threshold, but linear style speedups reducing b will
actually increase the threshold.  The latter can be seen for instance when
adding an optimized <code>mpn_sqr_diagonal</code> to <code>mpn_sqr_basecase</code>.  Of
course all speedups reduce total time, and in that sense the algorithm
thresholds are merely of academic interest.
