<h4>Basecase Division</h4>

<p>Basecase NxM division is like long division done by hand, but in base
2^mp_bits_per_limb.  See Knuth
section 4.3.1 algorithm D, and <code>mpn/generic/sb_divrem_mn.c</code>.

<p>Briefly stated, while the dividend remains larger than the divisor, a high
quotient limb is formed and the Nx1 product q*d subtracted at
the top end of the dividend.  With a normalized divisor (most significant bit
set), each quotient limb can be formed with a 2x1 division and a
1x1 multiplication plus some subtractions.  The 2x1 division is
by the high limb of the divisor and is done either with a hardware divide or a
multiply by inverse (the same as in <a href="Single-Limb-Division.html#Single%20Limb%20Division">Single Limb Division</a>) whichever is
faster.  Such a quotient is sometimes one too big, requiring an addback of the
divisor, but that happens rarely.

<p>With Q=N-M being the number of quotient limbs, this is an
O(Q*M) algorithm and will run at a speed similar to a basecase
QxM multiplication, differing in fact only in the extra multiply and
divide for each of the Q quotient limbs.
