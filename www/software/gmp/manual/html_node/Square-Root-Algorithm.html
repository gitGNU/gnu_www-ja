<h4>Square Root</h4>

<p>Square roots are taken using the "Karatsuba Square Root" algorithm by Paul
Zimmermann (see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>).  This is expressed in a divide and conquer
form, but as noted in the paper it can also be viewed as a discrete variant of
Newton's method.

<p>In the Karatsuba multiplication range this is an O(1.5*M(N/2)) algorithm, where M(n) is the time to multiply
two numbers of n limbs.  In the FFT multiplication range this grows to
a bound of O(6*M(N/2)).  In practice a factor of about 1.5 to
1.8 is found in the Karatsuba and Toom-3 ranges, growing to 2 or 3 in the FFT
range.

<p>The algorithm does all its calculations in integers and the resulting
<code>mpn_sqrtrem</code> is used for both <code>mpz_sqrt</code> and <code>mpf_sqrt</code>. 
The extended precision given by <code>mpf_sqrt_ui</code> is obtained by
padding with zero limbs.
