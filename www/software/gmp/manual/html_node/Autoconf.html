<h3>Autoconf</h3>

<p>Autoconf based applications can easily check whether GMP is installed.  The
only thing to be noted is that GMP library symbols from version 3 onwards have
prefixes like <code>__gmpz</code>.  The following therefore would be a simple test,

<br><pre>AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_init)
</pre>

<p>This just uses the default <code>AC_CHECK_LIB</code> actions for found or not found,
but an application that must have GMP would want to generate an error if not
found.  For example,

<br><pre>AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_init, , [AC_MSG_ERROR(
[GNU MP not found, see http://swox.com/gmp])])
</pre>

<p>If functions added in some particular version of GMP are required, then one of
those can be used when checking.  For example <code>mpz_mul_si</code> was added in
GMP 3.1,

<br><pre>AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_mul_si, , [AC_MSG_ERROR(
[GNU MP not found, or not 3.1 or up, see http://swox.com/gmp])])
</pre>

<p>An alternative would be to test the version number in <code>gmp.h</code> using say
<code>AC_EGREP_CPP</code>.  That would make it possible to test the exact version,
if some particular sub-minor release is known to be necessary.

<p>An application that can use either GMP 2 or 3 will need to test for
<code>__gmpz_init</code> (GMP 3 and up) or <code>mpz_init</code> (GMP 2), and it's also
worth checking for <code>libgmp2</code> since Debian GNU/Linux systems used that
name in the past.  For example,

<br><pre>AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_init, ,
  [AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, mpz_init, ,
    [AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp2, mpz_init)])])
</pre>

<p>In general it's suggested that applications should simply demand a new enough
GMP rather than trying to provide supplements for features not available in
past versions.

<p>Occasionally an application will need or want to know the size of a type at
configuration or preprocessing time, not just with <code>sizeof</code> in the code. 
This can be done in the normal way with <code>mp_limb_t</code> etc, but GMP 4.0 or
up is best for this, since prior versions needed certain <code>-D</code> defines on
systems using a <code>long long</code> limb.  The following would suit Autoconf 2.50
or up,

<br><pre>AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(mp_limb_t, , [#include &lt;gmp.h&gt;])
</pre>

<p>The optional <code>mpfr</code> functions are provided in a separate
<code>libmpfr.a</code>, and this might be from GMP with <code>--enable-mpfr</code> or
from MPFR installed separately.  Either way <code>libmpfr</code> depends on
<code>libgmp</code>, it doesn't stand alone.  Currently only a static
<code>libmpfr.a</code> will be available, not a shared library, since upward binary
compatibility is not guaranteed.

<br><pre>AC_CHECK_LIB(mpfr, mpfr_add, , [AC_MSG_ERROR(
[Need MPFR either from GNU MP 4 or separate MPFR package.
See http://www.mpfr.org or http://swox.com/gmp])
