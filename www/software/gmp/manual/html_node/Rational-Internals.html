<h3>Rational Internals</h3>

<p><code>mpq_t</code> variables represent rationals using an <code>mpz_t</code> numerator and
denominator (see <a href="Integer-Internals.html#Integer%20Internals">Integer Internals</a>).

<p>The canonical form adopted is denominator positive (and non-zero), no common
factors between numerator and denominator, and zero uniquely represented as
0/1.

<p>It's believed that casting out common factors at each stage of a calculation
is best in general.  A GCD is an O(N^2) operation so it's better to do
a few small ones immediately than to delay and have to do a big one later. 
Knowing the numerator and denominator have no common factors can be used for
example in <code>mpq_mul</code> to make only two cross GCDs necessary, not four.

<p>This general approach to common factors is badly sub-optimal in the presence
of simple factorizations or little prospect for cancellation, but GMP has no
way to know when this will occur.  As per <a href="Efficiency.html#Efficiency">Efficiency</a>, that's left to
applications.  The <code>mpq_t</code> framework might still suit, with
<code>mpq_numref</code> and <code>mpq_denref</code> for direct access to the numerator and
denominator, or of course <code>mpz_t</code> variables can be used directly.
