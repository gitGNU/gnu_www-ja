<h4>Jacobi Symbol</h4>

<p><code>mpz_jacobi</code> and <code>mpz_kronecker</code> are currently implemented with a
simple binary algorithm similar to that described for the GCDs (see <a href="Binary-GCD.html#Binary%20GCD">Binary GCD</a>).  They're not very fast when both inputs are large.  Lehmer's multi-step
improvement or a binary based multi-step algorithm is likely to be better.

<p>When one operand fits a single limb, and that includes <code>mpz_kronecker_ui</code>
and friends, an initial reduction is done with either <code>mpn_mod_1</code> or
<code>mpn_modexact_1_odd</code>, followed by the binary algorithm on a single limb. 
The binary algorithm is well suited to a single limb, and the whole
calculation in this case is quite efficient.

<p>In all the routines sign changes for the result are accumulated using some bit
twiddling, avoiding table lookups or conditional jumps.
