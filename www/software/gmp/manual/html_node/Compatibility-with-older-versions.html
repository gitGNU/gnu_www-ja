<h3>Compatibility with older versions</h3>

<p>This version of GMP is upwardly binary compatible with all 4.x and 3.x
versions, and upwardly compatible at the source level with all 2.x versions,
with the following exceptions.

<ul>
<li><code>mpn_gcd</code> had its source arguments swapped as of GMP 3.0, for consistency
with other <code>mpn</code> functions.

<li><code>mpf_get_prec</code> counted precision slightly differently in GMP 3.0 and
3.0.1, but in 3.1 reverted to the 2.x style. 
</ul>

<p>There are a number of compatibility issues between GMP 1 and GMP 2 that of
course also apply when porting applications from GMP 1 to GMP 4.  Please
see the GMP 2 manual for details.

<p>The Berkeley MP compatibility library (see <a href="BSD-Compatible-Functions.html#BSD%20Compatible%20Functions">BSD Compatible Functions</a>) is
source and binary compatible with the standard <code>libmp</code>.
