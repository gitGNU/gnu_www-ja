<h4>Assembler Basics</h4>

<p><code>mpn_addmul_1</code> and <code>mpn_submul_1</code> are the most important routines
for overall GMP performance.  All multiplications and divisions come down to
repeated calls to these.  <code>mpn_add_n</code>, <code>mpn_sub_n</code>,
<code>mpn_lshift</code> and <code>mpn_rshift</code> are next most important.

<p>On some CPUs assembler versions of the internal functions
<code>mpn_mul_basecase</code> and <code>mpn_sqr_basecase</code> give significant speedups,
mainly through avoiding function call overheads.  They can also potentially
make better use of a wide superscalar processor.

<p>The restrictions on overlaps between sources and destinations
(see <a href="Low-level-Functions.html#Low-level%20Functions">Low-level Functions</a>) are designed to facilitate a variety of
implementations.  For example, knowing <code>mpn_add_n</code> won't have partly
overlapping sources and destination means reading can be done far ahead of
writing on superscalar processors, and loops can be vectorized on a vector
processor, depending on the carry handling.
