<h2>Contributors</h2>

<p>Torbjorn Granlund wrote the original GMP library and is still developing and
maintaining it.  Several other individuals and organizations have contributed
to GMP in various ways.  Here is a list in chronological order:

<p>Gunnar Sjoedin and Hans Riesel helped with mathematical problems in early
versions of the library.

<p>Richard Stallman contributed to the interface design and revised the first
version of this manual.

<p>Brian Beuning and Doug Lea helped with testing of early versions of the
library and made creative suggestions.

<p>John Amanatides of York University in Canada contributed the function
<code>mpz_probab_prime_p</code>.

<p>Paul Zimmermann of Inria sparked the development of GMP 2, with his
comparisons between bignum packages.

<p>Ken Weber (Kent State University, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul)
contributed <code>mpz_gcd</code>, <code>mpz_divexact</code>, <code>mpn_gcd</code>, and
<code>mpn_bdivmod</code>, partially supported by CNPq (Brazil) grant 301314194-2.

<p>Per Bothner of Cygnus Support helped to set up GMP to use Cygnus' configure. 
He has also made valuable suggestions and tested numerous intermediary
releases.

<p>Joachim Hollman was involved in the design of the <code>mpf</code> interface, and in
the <code>mpz</code> design revisions for version 2.

<p>Bennet Yee contributed the initial versions of <code>mpz_jacobi</code> and
<code>mpz_legendre</code>.

<p>Andreas Schwab contributed the files <code>mpn/m68k/lshift.S</code> and
<code>mpn/m68k/rshift.S</code> (now in <code>.asm</code> form).

<p>The development of floating point functions of GNU MP 2, were supported in part
by the ESPRIT-BRA (Basic Research Activities) 6846 project POSSO (POlynomial
System SOlving).

<p>GNU MP 2 was finished and released by SWOX AB, SWEDEN, in cooperation with the
IDA Center for Computing Sciences, USA.

<p>Robert Harley of Inria, France and David Seal of ARM, England, suggested clever
improvements for population count.

<p>Robert Harley also wrote highly optimized Karatsuba and 3-way Toom
multiplication functions for GMP 3.  He also contributed the ARM assembly
code.

<p>Torsten Ekedahl of the Mathematical department of Stockholm University provided
significant inspiration during several phases of the GMP development.  His
mathematical expertise helped improve several algorithms.

<p>Paul Zimmermann wrote the Divide and Conquer division code, the REDC code, the
REDC-based mpz_powm code, the FFT multiply code, and the Karatsuba square
root.  The ECMNET project Paul is organizing was a driving force behind many
of the optimizations in GMP 3.

<p>Linus Nordberg wrote the new configure system based on autoconf and
implemented the new random functions.

<p>Kent Boortz made the Macintosh port.

<p>Kevin Ryde worked on a number of things: optimized x86 code, m4 asm macros,
parameter tuning, speed measuring, the configure system, function inlining,
divisibility tests, bit scanning, Jacobi symbols, Fibonacci and Lucas number
functions, printf and scanf functions, perl interface, demo expression parser,
the algorithms chapter in the manual, <code>gmpasm-mode.el</code>, and various
miscellaneous improvements elsewhere.

<p>Steve Root helped write the optimized alpha 21264 assembly code.

<p>Gerardo Ballabio wrote the <code>gmpxx.h</code> C++ class interface and the C++
<code>istream</code> input routines.

<p>GNU MP 4.0 was finished and released by Torbjorn Granlund and Kevin Ryde. 
Torbjorn's work was partially funded by the IDA Center for Computing Sciences,
USA.

<p>(This list is chronological, not ordered after significance.  If you have
contributed to GMP but are not listed above, please tell <a href="mailto:tege@swox.com">tege@swox.com</a>
about the omission!)

<p>Thanks goes to Hans Thorsen for donating an SGI system for the GMP test system
environment.
