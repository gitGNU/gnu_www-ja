<h4>Exact Remainder</h4>

<p>If the exact division algorithm is done with a full subtraction at each stage
and the dividend isn't a multiple of the divisor, then low zero limbs are
produced but with a remainder in the high limbs.  For dividend a,
divisor d, quotient q, and b = 2^mp_bits_per_limb, then this
remainder r is of the form

<br><pre>a = q*d + r*b^n
</pre>

<p>n represents the number of zero limbs produced by the subtractions,
that being the number of limbs produced for q.  r will be in the
range 0&lt;=r&lt;d and can be viewed as a remainder, but one shifted up by
a factor of b^n.

<p>Carrying out full subtractions at each stage means the same number of cross
products must be done as a normal division, but there's still some single limb
divisions saved.  When d is a single limb some simplifications arise,
providing good speedups on a number of processors.

<p><code>mpn_bdivmod</code>, <code>mpn_divexact_by3</code>, <code>mpn_modexact_1_odd</code> and the
<code>redc</code> function in <code>mpz_powm</code> differ subtly in how they return
r, leading to some negations in the above formula, but all are
essentially the same.

<p>Clearly r is zero when a is a multiple of d, and this
leads to divisibility or congruence tests which are potentially more efficient
than a normal division.

<p>The factor of b^n on r can be ignored in a GCD when d is
odd, hence the use of <code>mpn_bdivmod</code> in <code>mpn_gcd</code>, and the use of
<code>mpn_modexact_1_odd</code> by <code>mpn_gcd_1</code> and <code>mpz_kronecker_ui</code> etc
(see <a href="Greatest-Common-Divisor-Algorithms.html#Greatest%20Common%20Divisor%20Algorithms">Greatest Common Divisor Algorithms</a>).

<p>Montgomery's REDC method for modular multiplications uses operands of the form
of x*b^-n and y*b^-n and on calculating (x*b^-n)*(y*b^-n) uses the factor of b^n in the exact
remainder to reach a product in the same form (x*y)*b^-n
(see <a href="Modular-Powering-Algorithm.html#Modular%20Powering%20Algorithm">Modular Powering Algorithm</a>).

<p>Notice that r generally gives no useful information about the ordinary
remainder a mod d since b^n mod d could be anything.  If
however b^n == 1 mod d, then r is the negative of the
ordinary remainder.  This occurs whenever d is a factor of
b^n-1, as for example with 3 in <code>mpn_divexact_by3</code>.  Other such
factors include 5, 17 and 257, but no particular use has been found for this.
