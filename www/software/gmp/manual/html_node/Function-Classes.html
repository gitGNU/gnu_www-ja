<h3>Function Classes</h3>

<p>There are six classes of functions in the GMP library:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Functions for signed integer arithmetic, with names beginning with
<code>mpz_</code>.  The associated type is <code>mpz_t</code>.  There are about 150
functions in this class.

<li>Functions for rational number arithmetic, with names beginning with
<code>mpq_</code>.  The associated type is <code>mpq_t</code>.  There are about 40
functions in this class, but the integer functions can be used for arithmetic
on the numerator and denominator separately.

<li>Functions for floating-point arithmetic, with names beginning with
<code>mpf_</code>.  The associated type is <code>mpf_t</code>.  There are about 60
functions is this class.

<li>Functions compatible with Berkeley MP, such as <code>itom</code>, <code>madd</code>, and
<code>mult</code>.  The associated type is <code>MINT</code>.

<li>Fast low-level functions that operate on natural numbers.  These are used by
the functions in the preceding groups, and you can also call them directly
from very time-critical user programs.  These functions' names begin with
<code>mpn_</code>.  The associated type is array of <code>mp_limb_t</code>.  There are
about 30 (hard-to-use) functions in this class.

<li>Miscellaneous functions.  Functions for setting up custom allocation and
functions for generating random numbers.
