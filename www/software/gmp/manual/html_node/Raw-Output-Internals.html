<h3>Raw Output Internals</h3>

<p><code>mpz_out_raw</code> uses the following format.

<br><pre>+------+------------------------+
| size |       data bytes       |
+------+------------------------+
</pre>

<p>The size is 4 bytes written most significant byte first, being the number of
subsequent data bytes, or the twos complement negative of that when a negative
integer is represented.  The data bytes are the absolute value of the integer,
written most significant byte first.

<p>The most significant data byte is always non-zero, so the output is the same
on all systems, irrespective of limb size.

<p>In GMP 1, leading zero bytes were written to pad the data bytes to a multiple
of the limb size.  <code>mpz_inp_raw</code> will still accept this, for
compatibility.

<p>The use of "big endian" for both the size and data fields is deliberate, it
makes the data easy to read in a hex dump of a file.  Unfortunately it also
means that the limb data must be reversed when reading or writing, so neither
a big endian nor little endian system can just read and write <code>_mp_d</code>.
