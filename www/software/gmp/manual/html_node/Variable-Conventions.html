<h3>Variable Conventions</h3>

<p>GMP functions generally have output arguments before input arguments.  This
notation is by analogy with the assignment operator.  The BSD MP compatibility
functions are exceptions, having the output arguments last.

<p>GMP lets you use the same variable for both input and output in one call.  For
example, the main function for integer multiplication, <code>mpz_mul</code>, can be
used to square <code>x</code> and put the result back in <code>x</code> with

<br><pre>mpz_mul (x, x, x);
</pre>

<p>Before you can assign to a GMP variable, you need to initialize it by calling
one of the special initialization functions.  When you're done with a
variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the functions for that
purpose.  Which function to use depends on the type of variable.  See the
chapters on integer functions, rational number functions, and floating-point
functions for details.

<p>A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared between each
initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it may be assigned to
any number of times.

<p>For efficiency reasons, avoid excessive initializing and clearing.  In
general, initialize near the start of a function and clear near the end.  For
example,

<br><pre>void
foo (void)
{
  mpz_t  n;
  int    i;
  mpz_init (n);
  for (i = 1; i &lt; 100; i++)
    {
      mpz_mul (n, <small>...</small>);
      mpz_fdiv_q (n, <small>...</small>);
      <small>...</small>
    }
  mpz_clear (n);
}
</pre>
