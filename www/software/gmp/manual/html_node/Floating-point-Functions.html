<h2>Floating-point Functions</h2>

<p>GMP floating point numbers are stored in objects of type <code>mpf_t</code> and
functions operating on them have an <code>mpf_</code> prefix.

<p>The mantissa of each float has a user-selectable precision, limited only by
available memory.  Each variable has its own precision, and that can be
increased or decreased at any time.

<p>The exponent of each float is a fixed precision, one machine word on most
systems.  In the current implementation the exponent is a count of limbs, so
for example on a 32-bit system this means a range of roughly
2^-68719476768 to 2^68719476736, or on a 64-bit system
this will be greater.  Note however <code>mpf_get_str</code> can only return an
exponent which fits an <code>mp_exp_t</code> and currently <code>mpf_set_str</code>
doesn't accept exponents bigger than a <code>long</code>.

<p>Each variable keeps a size for the mantissa data actually in use.  This means
that if a float is exactly represented in only a few bits then only those bits
will be used in a calculation, even if the selected precision is high.

<p>All calculations are performed to the precision of the destination variable. 
Each function is defined to calculate with "infinite precision" followed by
a truncation to the destination precision, but of course the work done is only
what's needed to determine a result under that definition.

<p>The precision selected for a variable is a minimum value, GMP may increase it
a little to facilitate efficient calculation.  Currently this means rounding
up to a whole limb, and then sometimes having a further partial limb,
depending on the high limb of the mantissa.  But applications shouldn't be
concerned by such details.

<p><code>mpf</code> functions and variables have no special notion of infinity or
not-a-number, and applications must take care not to overflow the exponent or
results will be unpredictable.  This might change in a future release.

<p>Note that the <code>mpf</code> functions are <em>not</em> intended as a smooth
extension to IEEE P754 arithmetic.  In particular results obtained on one
computer often differ from the results on a computer with a different word
size.
