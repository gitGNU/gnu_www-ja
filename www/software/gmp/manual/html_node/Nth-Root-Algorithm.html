<h4>Nth Root</h4>

<p>Integer Nth roots are taken using Newton's method with the following
iteration, where A is the input and n is the root to be taken.

<br><pre>         1         A
a[i+1] = - * ( --------- + (n-1)*a[i] )
         n     a[i]^(n-1)
</pre>

<p>The initial approximation a[1] is generated bitwise by successively
powering a trial root with or without new 1 bits, aiming to be just above the
true root.  The iteration converges quadratically when started from a good
approximation.  When n is large more initial bits are needed to get
good convergence.  The current implementation is not particularly well
optimized.
