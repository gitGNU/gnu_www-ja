<h4>Accelerated GCD</h4>

<p>For sizes above <code>GCD_ACCEL_THRESHOLD</code>, GMP uses the Accelerated GCD
algorithm described independently by Weber and Jebelean (the latter as the
"Generalized Binary" algorithm), see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>.  This algorithm is
still O(N^2), but is much faster than the binary algorithm since it
does fewer multi-precision operations.  It consists of alternating the
k-ary reduction by Sorenson, and a "dmod" exact remainder reduction.

<p>For operands u and v the k-ary reduction replaces
u with n*v-d*u where n and d are single limb
values chosen to give two trailing zero limbs on that value, which can be
stripped.  n and d are calculated using an algorithm similar to
half of a two limb GCD (see <code>find_a</code> in <code>mpn/generic/gcd.c</code>).

<p>When u and v differ in size by more than a certain number of
bits, a dmod is performed to zero out bits at the low end of the larger.  It
consists of an exact remainder style division applied to an appropriate number
of bits (see <a href="Exact-Division.html#Exact%20Division">Exact Division</a>, and see <a href="Exact-Remainder.html#Exact%20Remainder">Exact Remainder</a>).  This is faster
than a k-ary reduction but useful only when the operands differ in
size.  There's a dmod after each k-ary reduction, and if the dmod
leaves the operands still differing in size then it's repeated.

<p>The k-ary reduction step can introduce spurious factors into the GCD
calculated, and these are eliminated at the end by taking GCDs with the
original inputs gcd(u,gcd(v,g)) using the binary algorithm. 
Since g is almost always small this takes very little time.

<p>At small sizes the algorithm needs a good implementation of <code>find_a</code>.  At
larger sizes it's dominated by <code>mpn_addmul_1</code> applying n and
d.
