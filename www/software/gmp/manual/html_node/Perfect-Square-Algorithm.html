<h4>Perfect Square</h4>

<p><code>mpz_perfect_square_p</code> is able to quickly exclude most non-squares by
checking whether the input is a quadratic residue modulo some small integers.

<p>The first test is modulo 256 which means simply examining the least
significant byte.  Only 44 different values occur as the low byte of a square,
so 82.8% of non-squares can be immediately excluded.  Similar tests modulo
primes from 3 to 29 exclude 99.5% of those remaining, or if a limb is 64 bits
then primes up to 53 are used, excluding 99.99%.  A single Nx1
remainder using <code>PP</code> from <code>gmp-impl.h</code> quickly gives all these
remainders.

<p>A square root must still be taken for any value that passes the residue tests,
to verify it's really a square and not one of the 0.086% (or 0.000156% for 64
bits) non-squares that get through.  See <a href="Square-Root-Algorithm.html#Square%20Root%20Algorithm">Square Root Algorithm</a>.
