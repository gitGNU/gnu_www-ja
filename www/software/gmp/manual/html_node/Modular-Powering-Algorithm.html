<h4>Modular Powering</h4>

<p>Modular powering is implemented using a 2^k-ary sliding window
algorithm, as per "Handbook of Applied Cryptography" algorithm 14.85
(see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>).  k is chosen according to the size of the
exponent.  Larger exponents use larger values of k, the choice being
made to minimize the average number of multiplications that must supplement
the squaring.

<p>The modular multiplies and squares use either a simple division or the REDC
method by Montgomery (see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>).  REDC is a little faster,
essentially saving N single limb divisions in a fashion similar to an exact
remainder (see <a href="Exact-Remainder.html#Exact%20Remainder">Exact Remainder</a>).  The current REDC has some limitations. 
It's only O(N^2) so above <code>POWM_THRESHOLD</code> division becomes faster
and is used.  It doesn't attempt to detect small bases, but rather always uses
a REDC form, which is usually a full size operand.  And lastly it's only
applied to odd moduli.
