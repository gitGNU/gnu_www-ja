<h3 class="section">16.2 DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.
</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-w</strong>
and <strong>-W</strong> switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="perlvar.html#perlvar-NAME">perlvar NAME</a>.
</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-X</strong> switch.
</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="../perlfunc/eval.html#eval">(perlfunc)eval</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
See <a href="../warnings/index.html">(warnings)</a>.
</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>accept() on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-accept_0028_0029-on-closed-socket-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="../perlfunc/accept.html#accept">(perlfunc)accept</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Allocation too large: %x</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Allocation-too-large_003a-_0025x"></a>
<p>(X) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&rsquo;%c&rsquo; allowed only after types %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0027_0025c_0027-allowed-only-after-types-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) The modifiers &rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; are allowed in pack() or unpack() only
after certain types.  See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE_003a_003a_0025s_0028_0029_002c-qualify-as-such-or-use-_0026"></a>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.
</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it&rsquo;s
imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).
</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code>CORE::log($x)</code>) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="../perlsub/Subroutine-Attributes.html#Subroutine-Attributes">(perlsub)Subroutine Attributes</a> or
<a href="../attributes/index.html">(attributes)</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator"></a>
<p>(F) You wrote something like <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> which doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at
all.  To include a <code>-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <code>tr/a-z-0//</code> was synonymous with
<code>tr/a-y//</code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_0025s-resolved-as-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it&rsquo;s pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_0025c-resolved-as-operator-_0025c"></a>
<p>(W ambiguous) <code>%</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code>*</code> are both infix operators (modulus,
bitwise and, and multiplication) <em>and</em> initial special characters
(denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something
like <code>*foo * foo</code> that might be interpreted as either of them.  We
assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more
clear &ndash; in the example given, you might write <code>*foo * foo()</code> if you
really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_0025c_007b_0025s_007d-resolved-to-_0025c_0025s"></a>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>@{foo}</code>, which might be
asking for the variable <code>@foo</code>, or it might be calling a function
named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference.  If you wanted
the variable, you can just write <code>@foo</code>.  If you wanted to call the
function, write <code>@{foo()}</code> ... or you could just not have a variable
and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_0025c_007b_0025s_005b_002e_002e_002e_005d_007d-resolved-to-_0025c_0025s_005b_002e_002e_002e_005d"></a>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_0025c_007b_0025s_007b_002e_002e_002e_007d_007d-resolved-to-_0025c_0025s_007b_002e_002e_002e_007d"></a>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>${foo[2]}</code> (where foo represents
the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number
2 of the array named <code>@foo</code>, in which case please write <code>$foo[2]</code>, or you
might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named
foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns.  If you meant
that, write <code>${foo([2])}</code>.
</p>
<p>In regular expressions, the <code>${foo[2]}</code> syntax is sometimes necessary
to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes.
<code>/$length[2345]/</code>, for instance, will be interpreted as <code>$length</code> followed
by the character class <code>[2345]</code>.  If an array subscript is what you
want, you can avoid the warning by changing <code>/${length[2345]}/</code> to the
unsightly <code>/${\$length[2345]}/</code>, by renaming your array to something
that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning
off warnings with <code>no warnings 'ambiguous';</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_002d_0025s-resolved-as-_002d_0026_0025s_0028_0029"></a>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>-foo</code>, which might be the
string <code>&quot;-foo&quot;</code>, or a call to the function <code>foo</code>, negated.  If you meant
the string, just write <code>&quot;-foo&quot;</code>.  If you meant the function call,
write <code>-foo()</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ambiguous use of &rsquo;s//le...&rsquo; resolved as &rsquo;s// le...&rsquo;; Rewrite as &rsquo;s//el&rsquo; if you meant &rsquo;use locale rules and evaluate rhs as an expression&rsquo;.  In Perl 5.18, it will be resolved the other way</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ambiguous-use-of-_0027s_002f_002fle_002e_002e_002e_0027-resolved-as-_0027s_002f_002f-le_002e_002e_002e_0027_003b-Rewrite-as-_0027s_002f_002fel_0027-if-you-meant-_0027use-locale-rules-and-evaluate-rhs-as-an-expression_0027_002e-In-Perl-5_002e18_002c-it-will-be-resolved-the-other-way"></a>
<p>(W deprecated, ambiguous) You wrote a pattern match with substitution
immediately followed by &quot;le&quot;.  In Perl 5.16 and earlier, this is
resolved as meaning to take the result of the substitution, and see if
it is stringwise less-than-or-equal-to what follows in the expression.
Having the &quot;le&quot; immediately following a pattern is deprecated behavior,
so in Perl 5.18, this expression will be resolved as meaning to do the
pattern match using the rules of the current locale, and evaluate the
rhs as an expression when doing the substitution.  In 5.14, and 5.16 if
you want the latter interpretation, you can simply write &quot;el&quot; instead.
But note that the <code>/l</code> modifier should not be used explicitly anyway;
you should use <code>use locale</code> instead.  See <a href="perllocale.html#perllocale-NAME">perllocale NAME</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&rsquo;|&rsquo; and &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command line</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0027_007c_0027-and-_0027_003c_0027-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect STDIN using &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&rsquo;|&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command line</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0027_007c_0027-and-_0027_003e_0027-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing&rsquo;s stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which &rsquo;splits&rsquo; output into two streams, such as
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Applying-_0025s-to-_0025s-will-act-on-scalar_0028_0025s_0029"></a>
<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code>//</code>), substitution (<code>s///</code>), and
transliteration (<code>tr///</code>) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash) and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <a href="../perlfunc/grep.html#grep">(perlfunc)grep</a> and <a href="../perlfunc/map.html#map">(perlfunc)map</a> for
alternatives.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Arg too short for msgsnd</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd"></a>
<p>(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or a subroutine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-argument-is-not-a-HASH-or-ARRAY-element-or-a-subroutine"></a>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() must be a hash or array element or a
subroutine with an ampersand, such as:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    &amp;do_something
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-argument-is-not-a-HASH-or-ARRAY-element-or-slice"></a>
<p>(F) The argument to delete() must be either a hash or array element,
such as:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
</pre>
<p>or a hash or array slice, such as:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>%s argument is not a subroutine name</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-argument-is-not-a-subroutine-name"></a>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() for <code>exists &amp;sub</code> must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <code>exists &amp;sub()</code> will generate this
error.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Argument &quot;%s&quot; isn&rsquo;t numeric%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Argument-_0022_0025s_0022-isn_0027t-numeric_0025s"></a>
<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you&rsquo;re fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Argument-list-not-closed-for-PerlIO-layer-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O
system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers
take care of transforming data between external and internal
representations.)  Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this
point and did not attempt to push this layer.  If your program
didn&rsquo;t explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the
result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Array-_0040_0025s-missing-the-_0040-in-argument-_0025d-of-_0025s_0028_0029"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>assertion botched: %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-assertion-botched_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Assertion failed: file &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Assertion-failed_003a-file-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(X) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Assigning-non_002dzero-to-_0024_005b-is-no-longer-possible"></a>
<p>(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., under <code>use v5.16;</code>)
the special variable <code>$[</code>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar"></a>
<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won&rsquo;t
know which context to supply to the right side.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>A thread exited while %d threads were running</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-A-thread-exited-while-_0025d-threads-were-running"></a>
<p>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily
the main thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it&rsquo;s a good idea first to collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then to exit from the main
thread.  See <a href="../threads/index.html">(threads)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to access disallowed key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; in a restricted hash</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-access-disallowed-key-_0027_0025s_0027-in-a-restricted-hash"></a>
<p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in
the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to bless into a reference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-bless-into-a-reference"></a>
<p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into.  You&rsquo;ve
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    bless $self, $proto;
</pre>
<p>when you intended
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
</pre>
<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified version
of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for
example by:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to clear deleted array</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-clear-deleted-array"></a>
<p>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed.
Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code.  This
can also happen if XS code calls <code>av_clear</code> from a custom magic
callback on the array.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to delete disallowed key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-delete-disallowed-key-_0027_0025s_0027-from-a-restricted-hash"></a>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
which is not in its key set.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to delete readonly key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-delete-readonly-key-_0027_0025s_0027-from-a-restricted-hash"></a>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
declared readonly from a restricted hash.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-free-non_002darena-SV_003a-0x_0025x"></a>
<p>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string &rsquo;%s&rsquo;%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-free-nonexistent-shared-string-_0027_0025s_0027_0025s"></a>
<p>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely_003a-SV-0x_0025x"></a>
<p>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
free_tmps() routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the
free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers"></a>
<p>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.

<dt>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar_003a-SV-0x_0025x"></a>
<p>(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or
that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn&rsquo;t have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to join self</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-join-self"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the join() to some other thread.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value"></a>
<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template to
avoid this warning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to reload %s aborted.</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-reload-_0025s-aborted_002e"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to load a file with <code>use</code> or <code>require</code> that failed to
compile once already.  Perl will not try to compile this file again
unless you delete its entry from %INC.  See <a href="../perlfunc/require.html#require">(perlfunc)require</a> and
<a href="perlvar.html#perlvar-_0025INC">perlvar %INC</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to set length of freed array</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-set-length-of-freed-array"></a>
<p>(W) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed.  You
can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index
of an array and later assigning through that reference.  For example
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr"></a>
<p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr()
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See <a href="../perlfunc/substr.html#substr">(perlfunc)substr</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attribute &quot;locked&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attribute-_0022locked_0022-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the
&quot;locked&quot; attribute on a code reference.  The :locked attribute is
obsolete, has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed, and
will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attribute &quot;unique&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Attribute-_0022unique_0022-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify
the &quot;unique&quot; attribute on an array, hash or scalar reference.
The :unique attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8, and
will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>av_reify called on tied array</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-av_005freify-called-on-tied-array"></a>

<dd><a name="perldiag-Bad-arg-length-for-_0025s_002c-is-_0025u_002c-should-be-_0025d"></a>
<p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl()
or shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">msqid_ds</span>&nbsp;*)<!-- /@w -->, sizeof(struct&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">semid_ds</span>&nbsp;*)<!-- /@w -->, and

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bad evalled substitution pattern</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bad-evalled-substitution-pattern"></a>
<p>(F) You&rsquo;ve used the <code>/e</code> switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace &rsquo;}&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bad filehandle: %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bad-filehandle_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t do an
open(), or did it in another package.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bad free() ignored</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bad-free_0028_0029-ignored"></a>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had never
been malloc()ed in the first place.  Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <code>PERL_BADFREE</code> to 0.
</p>
<p>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with &quot;hard&quot;
dynamic linking, like <code>AIX</code> and <code>OS/2</code>.  It is a bug of <code>Berkeley DB</code>
which is left unnoticed if <code>DB</code> uses <em>forgiving</em> system malloc().

Perl yourself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bad name after %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bad-name-after-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn&rsquo;t finish the symbol.  In particular, you can&rsquo;t interpolate outside
of quotes, so
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;
</pre>
<p>is not the same as
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $var = 'myvar';

<dt>Bad realloc() ignored</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bad-realloc_0028_0029-ignored"></a>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something that

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bad symbol for array</dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bareword found in conditional</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bareword-found-in-conditional"></a>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    open FOO || die;
</pre>
<p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }
</pre>
<p>The <code>strict</code> pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bareword-_0022_0025s_0022-not-allowed-while-_0022strict-subs_0022-in-use"></a>
<p>(F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the &quot;=&gt;&quot;
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bareword-_0022_0025s_0022-refers-to-nonexistent-package"></a>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code>Foo::</code>, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?
</p>
</dd>
<dt>BEGIN failed&ndash;compilation aborted</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-BEGIN-failed_002d_002dcompilation-aborted"></a>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>BEGIN not safe after errors&ndash;compilation aborted</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors_002d_002dcompilation-aborted"></a>
<p>(F) Perl found a <code>BEGIN {}</code> subroutine (or a <code>use</code> directive, which
implies a <code>BEGIN {}</code>) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code>BEGIN {}</code> could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>\1 better written as $1</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_005c1-better-written-as-_00241"></a>
<p>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it&rsquo;s better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Buffer-overflow-in-prime_005fenv_005fiter_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to
iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition
which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Bizarre-SvTYPE-_005b_0025d_005d"></a>

<dt>%s() called too early to check prototype</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s_0028_0029-called-too-early-to-check-prototype"></a>
<p>(W prototype) You&rsquo;ve called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you&rsquo;re calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See <a href="../perlsub/index.html">(perlsub)</a>.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Cannot-compress-integer-in-pack"></a>
<p>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress.  The BER
compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308).

<dt>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Cannot-convert-a-reference-to-_0025s-to-typeglob"></a>
<p>(F) You manipulated Perl&rsquo;s symbol table directly, stored a reference
in it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax.
The access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is
no legal conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cannot copy to %s</dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cannot tie unreifiable array</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Cannot-tie-unreifiable-array"></a>
<p>(P) You somehow managed to call <code>tie</code> on an array that does not
keep a reference count on its arguments and cannot be made to
do so.  Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to
Perl code, but are only used internally.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can-only-compress-unsigned-integers-in-pack"></a>
<p>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer.  The BER compressed

<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an undefined value.  Something
like this will reproduce the error:
</p>

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-call-method-_0022_0025s_0022-on-unblessed-reference"></a>
<p>(F) A method call must know in what package it&rsquo;s supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn&rsquo;t supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn&rsquo;t an
object reference until it has been blessed.  See <a href="../perlobj/index.html">(perlobj)</a>.

<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns a
defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name.
Something like this will reproduce the error:
</p>

<p>(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima.  If you really
want your regexp to match something 0 times, just put {0}.  The
&lt;&ndash; HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem
was discovered.  See <a href="../perlre/index.html">(perlre)</a>.

<dt>Can&rsquo;t do waitpid with flags</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-do-waitpid-with-flags"></a>
<p>(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only
waitpid() without flags is emulated.

<dt>Can&rsquo;t emulate -%s on #! line</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-emulate-_002d_0025s-on-_0023_0021-line"></a>
<p>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn&rsquo;t make sense at this
point.  For example, it&rsquo;d be kind of silly to put a <strong>-x</strong> on the #!
line.

<p>(F) Your platform&rsquo;s byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian,
or it has a very strange pointer size.  Packing and unpacking big- or
little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-exec-_0022_0025s_0022_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the
permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn&rsquo;t found in
<code>$ENV{PATH}</code>, the executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that
can&rsquo;t be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn&rsquo;t support
#! at all.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t exec %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-exec-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
that&rsquo;s what the #! line said.  If that&rsquo;s not what you wanted, you may
need to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line somewhere.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t execute %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-execute-_0025s"></a>

<dt>Can&rsquo;t find %s on PATH, &rsquo;.&rsquo; not in PATH</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-find-_0025s-on-PATH_002c-_0027_002e_0027-not-in-PATH"></a>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-find-string-terminator-_0025s-anywhere-before-EOF"></a>
<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);
</pre>
<p>If you&rsquo;re getting this error from a here-document, you may have
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or there
may not be a linebreak after it.  A good programmer&rsquo;s editor will have
a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).  See
<a href="../perlop/index.html">(perlop)</a> for the full details on here-documents.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-find-Unicode-property-definition-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(F) You may have tried to use <code>\p</code> which means a Unicode
property (for example <code>\p{Lu}</code> matches all uppercase
letters).  If you did mean to use a Unicode property, see
<a href="../perluniprops/Properties-accessible-through-_005cp_007b_007d-and-_005cP_007b_007d.html#Properties-accessible-through-_005cp_007b_007d-and-_005cP_007b_007d">(perluniprops)Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}</a>
for a complete list of available properties.  If you didn&rsquo;t
mean to use a Unicode property, escape the <code>\p</code>, either by
<code>\\p</code> (just the <code>\p</code>) or by <code>\Q\p</code> (the rest of the string, or
until <code>\E</code>).

<dt>Can&rsquo;t get filespec - stale stat buffer?</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-get-filespec-_002d-stale-stat-buffer_003f"></a>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven&rsquo;t made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl <code>stat</code> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn&rsquo;t ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t get pipe mailbox device name</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can&rsquo;t retrieve its name for later use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn&rsquo;t get an answer.

<dt>Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-_0022goto_0022-into-the-middle-of-a-foreach-loop"></a>
<p>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can&rsquo;t get there from here.  See <a href="../perlfunc/goto.html#goto">(perlfunc)goto</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot; out of a pseudo block</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-_0022goto_0022-out-of-a-pseudo-block"></a>
<p>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn&rsquo;t a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See <a href="../perlfunc/goto.html#goto">(perlfunc)goto</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-goto-subroutine-from-a-sort-sub-_0028or-similar-callback_0029"></a>
<p>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a sort(), or from a similar callback (such
as the reduce() function in List::Util).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine from an eval-%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-goto-subroutine-from-an-eval_002d_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of an eval
&quot;string&quot; or block.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine outside a subroutine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-goto-subroutine-outside-a-subroutine"></a>
<p>(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can&rsquo;t manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See <a href="../perlfunc/goto.html#goto">(perlfunc)goto</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-ignore-signal-CHLD_002c-forcing-to-default"></a>
<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t kill a non-numeric process ID</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-kill-a-non_002dnumeric-process-ID"></a>
<p>(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers.  It is a fatal error to
attempt to kill() an undefined, empty-string or otherwise non-numeric
process identifier.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t &quot;last&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-_0022last_0022-outside-a-loop-block"></a>
<p>(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there&rsquo;s this itty bitty problem called there isn&rsquo;t a current
block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count as a &quot;loopish&quot;
block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
<a href="../perlfunc/last.html#last">(perlfunc)last</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t linearize anonymous symbol table</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-linearize-anonymous-symbol-table"></a>
<p>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, but failed because the package stash has no name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t load &rsquo;%s&rsquo; for module %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-load-_0027_0025s_0027-for-module-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension.
This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one
that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known
to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your
dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library
that is installed on your system.  You may need to rebuild your old
dynamic extensions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t localize lexical variable %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-localize-lexical-variable-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;.  This is not allowed.  If you
want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with
the package name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t localize through a reference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-localize-through-a-reference"></a>
<p>(F) You said something like <code>local $$ref</code>, which Perl can&rsquo;t currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can&rsquo;t be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t locate %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-locate-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You said to <code>do</code> (or <code>require</code>, or <code>use</code>) a file that couldn&rsquo;t be found.
Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless
the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need
to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the
extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
<a href="../perlfunc/require.html#require">(perlfunc)require</a> and <a href="../lib/index.html">(lib)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t locate auto/%s.al in @INC</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-locate-auto_002f_0025s_002eal-in-_0040INC"></a>
<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <code>AutoSplit</code>
the file, say, by doing <code>make install</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-locate-loadable-object-for-module-_0025s-in-_0040INC"></a>
<p>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like
for example, <samp>foo.so</samp> or <samp>bar.dll</samp>, but the <a href="../DynaLoader/index.html">(DynaLoader)</a> module was
unable to locate this library.  See <a href="../DynaLoader/index.html">(DynaLoader)</a>.

<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn&rsquo;t define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See <a href="../perlobj/index.html">(perlobj)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t locate package %s for @%s::ISA</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-locate-package-_0025s-for-_0040_0025s_003a_003aISA"></a>
<p>(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that

</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t locate PerlIO%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-locate-PerlIO_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
e.g. open(FH, &quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;, &quot;somefile&quot;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t make list assignment to %ENV on this system</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-make-list-assignment-to-_0025ENV-on-this-system"></a>
<p>(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.

</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t modify %s in %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-modify-_0025s-in-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You aren&rsquo;t allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t modify nonexistent substring</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-modify-nonexistent-substring"></a>
<p>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.

</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue subroutine call</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-modify-non_002dlvalue-subroutine-call"></a>
<p>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such.  See <a href="../perlsub/Lvalue-subroutines.html#Lvalue-subroutines">(perlsub)Lvalue subroutines</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t msgrcv to read-only var</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-msgrcv-to-read_002donly-var"></a>
<p>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.
</p>

<dt>Can&rsquo;t &quot;next&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-_0022next_0022-outside-a-loop-block"></a>
<p>(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn&rsquo;t a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t
count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See <a href="../perlfunc/next.html#next">(perlfunc)next</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to run a perl built with MAD support with
the PERL_XMLDUMP environment variable set, but the file
named by that variable could not be opened.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open %s: %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-_0025s_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>
filehandle, either implicitly under the <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually
this is because you don&rsquo;t have read permission for a file which
you named on the command line.
</p>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <strong>-e</strong> switch, but <samp>/dev/null</samp> (or
your operating system&rsquo;s equivalent) could not be opened.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open a reference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-a-reference"></a>
<p>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing,
using the 3-arg open() syntax:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    open FH, '&gt;', $ref;
</pre>
<p>but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open bidirectional pipe</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-bidirectional-pipe"></a>
<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <code>open(CMD, &quot;|cmd|&quot;)</code>, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe&rsquo;s output to a file using
&quot;&gt;&quot;, and then read it in under a different file handle.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open error file %s as stderr</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-error-file-_0025s-as-stderr"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified after &rsquo;2&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;2&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on
the command line for writing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open input file %s as stdin</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-input-file-_0025s-as-stdin"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified after &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; on the
command line for reading.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open output file %s as stdout</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-output-file-_0025s-as-stdout"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified after &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on
the command line for writing.
</p>

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-output-pipe-_0028name_003a-_0025s_0029"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the pipe into which to send data destined
for stdout.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t open perl script &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-open-perl-script-_0022_0025s_0022_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) The script you specified can&rsquo;t be opened for the indicated reason.
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell&rsquo;s $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so
you don&rsquo;t have to type the path or <code>`which $scriptname`</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t read CRTL environ</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-read-CRTL-environ"></a>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <samp>PERL_ENV_TABLES</samp> (see <a href="perlvms.html#perlvms-NAME">perlvms NAME</a>) so that environ is not
searched.
</p>

<dt>Can&rsquo;t &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-_0022redo_0022-outside-a-loop-block"></a>
<p>(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn&rsquo;t a current block.  Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t
count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block given to sort(), map()

though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a href="../perlfunc/redo.html#redo">(perlfunc)redo</a>.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-remove-_0025s_003a-_0025s_002c-skipping-file"></a>
<p>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.

<dt>Can&rsquo;t rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-rename-_0025s-to-_0025s_003a-_0025s_002c-skipping-file"></a>
<p>(S inplace) The rename done by the <strong>-i</strong> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don&rsquo;t have write permission to the directory.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-reopen-input-pipe-_0028name_003a-_0025s_0029-in-binary-mode"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t reset %ENV on this system</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-reset-_0025ENV-on-this-system"></a>
<p>(F) You called <code>reset('E')</code> or similar, which tried to reset
all variables in the current package beginning with &quot;E&quot;.  In
the main package, that includes %ENV.  Resetting %ENV is not
supported on some systems, notably VMS.

<p>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the

<dt>Can&rsquo;t return %s from lvalue subroutine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-return-_0025s-from-lvalue-subroutine"></a>
<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t return outside a subroutine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-return-outside-a-subroutine"></a>
<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See <a href="../perlsub/index.html">(perlsub)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t return %s to lvalue scalar context</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-return-_0025s-to-lvalue-scalar-context"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl
think you meant to return only one value.  You probably meant to
write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.

<dt>Can&rsquo;t stat script &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-stat-script-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>

</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t take log of %g</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-take-log-of-_0025g"></a>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can&rsquo;t take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero.  There&rsquo;s a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t take sqrt of %g</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-take-sqrt-of-_0025g"></a>

<dt>Can&rsquo;t undef active subroutine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-undef-active-subroutine"></a>
<p>(F) You can&rsquo;t undefine a routine that&rsquo;s currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it&rsquo;s running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.
</p>
</dd>

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-upgrade-_0025s-_0028_0025d_0029-to-_0025d"></a>
<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_0027_0025c_0027-after-_002dmname"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to call perl with the <strong>-m</strong> switch, but you put something
other than &quot;=&quot; after the module name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-anonymous-symbol-table-for-method-lookup"></a>
<p>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn&rsquo;t have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: <code>undef %Some::Package::</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use an undefined value as %s reference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-an-undefined-value-as-_0025s-reference"></a>
<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.
</p>

<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;.  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="../perlref/index.html">(perlref)</a>.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_0025_0021-because-Errno_002epm-is-not-available"></a>
<p>(F) The first time the <code>%!</code> hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module.  The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <code>$!</code> errno values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use both &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; after type &rsquo;%c&rsquo; in %s</dt>

<p>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
allowed.  See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use %s for loop variable</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_0025s-for-loop-variable"></a>
<p>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a
foreach.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use global %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-global-_0025s-in-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren&rsquo;t.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use &rsquo;%c&rsquo; in a group with different byte-order in %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_0027_0025c_0027-in-a-group-with-different-byte_002dorder-in-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that
is inside a big-endian group.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_0022my-_0025s_0022-in-sort-comparison"></a>
<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use %s ref as %s ref</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_0025s-ref-as-_0025s-ref"></a>
<p>(F) You&rsquo;ve mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use string (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-string-_0028_0022_0025s_0022_0029-as-_0025s-ref-while-_0022strict-refs_0022-in-use"></a>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;.  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="../perlref/index.html">(perlref)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use subscript on %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-subscript-on-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn&rsquo;t look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t use \%c to mean $%c in expression</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-use-_005c_0025c-to-mean-_0024_0025c-in-expression"></a>
<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t weaken a nonreference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-weaken-a-nonreference"></a>
<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-_0022when_0022-outside-a-topicalizer"></a>
<p>(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a <code>foreach</code>
loop nor a <code>given</code> block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit
from the <code>when</code> block, so you won&rsquo;t get the error if the match fails,
or if you use an explicit <code>continue</code>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can&rsquo;t x= to read-only value</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Can_0027t-x_003d-to-read_002donly-value"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be ASCII</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Character-following-_0022_005cc_0022-must-be-ASCII"></a>
<p>(F)(W deprecated, syntax) In <code>\c<em>X</em></code>, <em>X</em> must be an ASCII character.
It is planned to make this fatal in all instances in Perl 5.18.  In the
cases where it isn&rsquo;t fatal, the character this evaluates to is
derived by exclusive or&rsquo;ing the code point of this character with 0x40.
</p>
<p>Note that non-alphabetic ASCII characters are discouraged here as well.

</pre>
<p>where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255.  However, <code>U0</code>-mode

<p>(D deprecated, syntax) The <code>\c<em>X</em></code> construct is intended to be a way
to specify non-printable characters.  You used it with a &quot;{&quot; which
evaluates to &quot;;&quot;, which is printable.  It is planned to remove the
ability to specify a semi-colon this way in Perl 5.18.  Just use a

<p>(W utf8, non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum
of U+10FFFF.
</p>
<p>Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, up
to the limit of what is storable in an unsigned integer on your system,
but these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  At one time,
it was legal in some standards to have code points up to 0x7FFF_FFFF,
but not higher.  Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a
32 bit word.
</p>
<p>None of the Unicode or Perl-defined properties will match a non-Unicode
code point.  For example,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    chr(0x7FF_FFFF) =~ /\p{Any}/
</pre>
<p>will not match, because the code point is not in Unicode.  But
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    chr(0x7FF_FFFF) =~ /\P{Any}/
</pre>
<p>will match.

<p>This may be counterintuitive at times, as both these fail:

 chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}     # Also fails!

<p>(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex

arbitrarily.  (&quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;medium&quot; situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <code>while</code>) rather than
in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See <a href="../perlfaq2/index.html">(perlfaq2)</a> for information

The cond_broadcast() function is used to wake up another thread

<p>(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the <code>use constant</code> pragma)

<p>(F) You tried to call a subroutine in the <code>CORE::</code> namespace
with <code>&amp;foo</code> syntax or through a reference.  Some subroutines
in this package cannot yet be called that way, but must be
called as barewords.  Something like this will work:

<p>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an
infinite recursion, unless you&rsquo;re writing strange benchmark programs, in
which case it indicates something else.
</p>
<p>This threshold can be changed from 100, by recompiling the <samp>perl</samp> binary,
setting the C pre-processor macro <code>PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN</code> to the desired value.

<dt>defined(@array) is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-defined_0028_0040array_0029-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined <em>scalar</em> value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use <code>if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>defined(%hash) is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-defined_0028_0025hash_0029-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) <code>defined()</code> is not usually right on hashes and has been
discouraged since 5.004.
</p>
<p>Although <code>defined %hash</code> is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it
becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators,
weak references, stash names, even remaining true after <code>undef %hash</code>.
These things make <code>defined %hash</code> fairly useless in practice.
</p>
<p>If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean
context (see <a href="perldata.html#perldata-Scalar-values">perldata Scalar values</a>):
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }
</pre>
<p>If you had <code>defined %Foo::Bar::QUUX</code> to check whether such a package
variable exists then that&rsquo;s never really been reliable, and isn&rsquo;t
a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether
it&rsquo;s loaded, etc.

<p>(F) You used something like <code>(?(DEFINE)...|..)</code> which is illegal.  The

<dd><a name="perldiag-Delimiter-for-here-document-is-too-long"></a>
<p>(F) In a here document construct like <code>&lt;&lt;FOO</code>, the label <code>FOO</code> is too

<p>(D deprecated) Just about anything is legal for the <code>...</code> in <code>\N{...}</code>.
But starting in 5.12, non-reasonable ones that don&rsquo;t look like names

and continues with any combination of alphanumerics, dashes, spaces,
parentheses or colons.

</dd>
<dt>Deprecated use of my() in false conditional</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Deprecated-use-of-my_0028_0029-in-false-conditional"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <code>my $x if 0</code>.  There
has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable
not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false
conditional.  Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of
static variable.  Since we intend to fix this bug, we don&rsquo;t want people
relying on this behavior.  You can achieve a similar static effect by
declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
</pre>
<p>becomes
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }
</pre>
<p>Beginning with perl 5.9.4, you can also use <code>state</code> variables to have
lexicals that are initialized only once (see <a href="../feature/index.html">(feature)</a>):
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    sub f { state $x; return $x++ }

than to create a dangling reference.

<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-did-not-return-a-true-value"></a>
<p>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It&rsquo;s
traditional to end such a file with a &quot;1;&quot;, though any true value would
do.  See <a href="../perlfunc/require.html#require">(perlfunc)require</a>.

@hash{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.
</p>

<dd><a name="perldiag-_0028Do-you-need-to-predeclare-_0025s_003f_0029"></a>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
&quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;.  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn&rsquo;t been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
&quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; statement.  If you&rsquo;re referencing
something that isn&rsquo;t defined yet, you don&rsquo;t actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
&quot;sub foo;&quot; or &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot; declaration.

<dd><a name="perldiag-elseif-should-be-elsif"></a>
<p>(S syntax) There is no keyword &quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks
it&rsquo;s ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named &quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by the following block.  This is

</dd>
<dt>Error converting file specification %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Error-converting-file-specification-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you&rsquo;ve passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you&rsquo;ve found a case the

<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
<code>(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk,
it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by using the
<code>re 'eval'</code> pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().  See
<a href="../perlre/_0028_003f_007b-code-_007d_0029.html#g_t_0028_003f_007b-code-_007d_0029">(perlre)(?{ code })</a>.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Fatal-VMS-error-_0028status_003d_0025d_0029-at-_0025s_002c-line-_0025d"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS
system service or RTL routine; Perl&rsquo;s exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in &quot;at %s&quot; and the line number in &quot;line %d&quot; tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fcntl is not implemented</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-fcntl-is-not-implemented"></a>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn&rsquo;t implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?
</p>
</dd>
<dt>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-FETCHSIZE-returned-a-negative-value"></a>
<p>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which
is not possible.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Field too wide in &rsquo;u&rsquo; format in pack</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Field-too-wide-in-_0027u_0027-format-in-pack"></a>
<p>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string start with a length indicator
which can&rsquo;t encode values above 63.  So there is no point in asking for
a line length bigger than that.  Perl will behave as if you specified
<code>u63</code> as the format.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Filehandle %s opened only for input</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Filehandle-_0025s-opened-only-for-input"></a>
<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;.  See <a href="../perlfunc/open.html#open">(perlfunc)open</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Filehandle %s opened only for output</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Filehandle-_0025s-opened-only-for-output"></a>
<p>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&gt;&quot;.  If you intended only to
read from the file, use &quot;&lt;&quot;.  See <a href="../perlfunc/open.html#open">(perlfunc)open</a>.  Another possibility
is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for
output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Filehandle-_0025s-reopened-as-_0025s-only-for-input"></a>
<p>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDOUT or STDERR.  This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
previously.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Filehandle-STDIN-reopened-as-_0025s-only-for-output"></a>
<p>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDIN.  This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Final $ should be \$ or $name</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Final-_0024-should-be-_005c_0024-or-_0024name"></a>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>flock() on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-flock_0028_0029-on-closed-filehandle-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re attempting to flock() got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  flock() operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the
same name?
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Format not terminated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Format-not-terminated"></a>
<p>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Format %s redefined</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Format-_0025s-redefined"></a>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;format NAME =...&quot;;
    }
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Found = in conditional, should be ==</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Found-_003d-in-conditional_002c-should-be-_003d_003d"></a>
<p>(W syntax) You said
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    if ($foo = 123)
</pre>
<p>when you meant
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    if ($foo == 123)
</pre>
<p>(or something like that).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s found where operator expected</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-found-where-operator-expected"></a>
<p>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-gdbm-store-returned-_0025d_002c-errno-_0025d_002c-key-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gethostent not implemented</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-gethostent-not-implemented"></a>
<p>(F) Your C library apparently doesn&rsquo;t implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it&rsquo;d feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>get%sname() on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-get_0025sname_0028_0029-on-closed-socket-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?
</p>
</dd>
<dt>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-getpwnam-returned-invalid-UIC-_0025_0023o-for-user-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  The call to <code>sys$getuai</code> underlying the
<code>getpwnam</code> operator returned an invalid UIC.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>getsockopt() on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-getsockopt_0028_0029-on-closed-socket-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="../perlfunc/getsockopt.html#getsockopt">(perlfunc)getsockopt</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Global symbol &quot;%s&quot; requires explicit package name</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Global-symbol-_0022_0025s_0022-requires-explicit-package-name"></a>
<p>(F) You&rsquo;ve said &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which indicates 
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;), 
declared beforehand using &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say 
which package the global variable is in (using &quot;::&quot;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>glob failed (%s)</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-glob-failed-_0028_0025s_0029"></a>
<p>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used
for <code>glob</code> and <code>&lt;*.c&gt;</code>.  Usually, this means that you supplied a <code>glob</code>
pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell)
is broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables
in config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as
if it were csh (e.g. <code>full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'</code>); otherwise, make them
all empty (except that <code>d_csh</code> should be <code>'undef'</code>) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code>./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Glob not terminated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Glob-not-terminated"></a>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it&rsquo;s looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gmtime(%f) too large</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-gmtime_0028_0025f_0029-too-large"></a>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code>gmtime</code> with a number that was larger than
it can reliably handle and <code>gmtime</code> probably returned the wrong
date.  This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special
not-a-number value).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gmtime(%f) too small</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-gmtime_0028_0025f_0029-too-small"></a>
<p>(W overflow) You called <code>gmtime</code> with a number that was smaller than
it can reliably handle and <code>gmtime</code> probably returned the wrong date.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Got an error from DosAllocMem</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Got-an-error-from-DosAllocMem"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you&rsquo;re using an obsolete
version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>goto must have label</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-goto-must-have-label"></a>
<p>(F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you&rsquo;re not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See <a href="../perlfunc/goto.html#goto">(perlfunc)goto</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Goto undefined subroutine%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Goto-undefined-subroutine_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to call a subroutine with <code>goto &amp;sub</code> syntax, but
the indicated subroutine hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>()-group starts with a count</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0028_0029_002dgroup-starts-with-a-count"></a>
<p>(F) A ()-group started with a count.  A count is supposed to follow
something: a template character or a ()-group.  See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s had compilation errors.</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-had-compilation-errors_002e"></a>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code>perl -c</code> fails.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Had to create %s unexpectedly</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Had-to-create-_0025s-unexpectedly"></a>
<p>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
to have existed already, but for some reason it didn&rsquo;t, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Hash-_0025_0025s-missing-the-_0025-in-argument-_0025d-of-_0025s_0028_0029"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s has too many errors</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-has-too-many-errors"></a>
<p>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Having no space between pattern and following word is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Having-no-space-between-pattern-and-following-word-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D syntax)
</p>
<p>You had a word that isn&rsquo;t a regex modifier immediately following
a pattern without an intervening space.  If you are trying to use
the <code>/le</code> flags on a substitution, use <code>/el</code> instead.  Otherwise, add
white space between the pattern and following word to eliminate
the warning.  As an example of the latter, the two constructs:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> $a =~ m/$foo/sand $bar
 $a =~ m/$foo/s and $bar
</pre>
<p>both currently mean the same thing, but it is planned to disallow
the first form in Perl 5.18.  And,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> $a =~ m/$foo/and $bar
</pre>
<p>will be disallowed too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Hexadecimal-number-_003e-0xffffffff-non_002dportable"></a>
<p>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html#perlport-NAME">perlport NAME</a> for more on portability concerns.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Identifier too long</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Identifier-too-long"></a>
<p>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <code>$A::B</code>).  You&rsquo;ve exceeded Perl&rsquo;s limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ignoring-zero-length-_005cN_007b_007d-in-character-class"></a>
<p>(W) Named Unicode character escapes <code>(\N{...})</code> may return a zero-length
sequence.  When such an escape is used in a character class its
behaviour is not well defined.  Check that the correct escape has
been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal binary digit %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-binary-digit-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-binary-digit-_0025s-ignored"></a>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a
binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal character after &rsquo;_&rsquo; in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-character-after-_0027_005f_0027-in-prototype-for-_0025s-_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-character-_005c_0025o-_0028carriage-return_0029"></a>
<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-character-in-prototype-for-_0025s-_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \, and +.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-declaration-of-anonymous-subroutine"></a>
<p>(F) When using the <code>sub</code> keyword to construct an anonymous subroutine,
you must always specify a block of code.  See <a href="../perlsub/index.html">(perlsub)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-declaration-of-subroutine-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly.  See <a href="../perlsub/index.html">(perlsub)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal division by zero</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-division-by-zero"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-hexadecimal-digit-_0025s-ignored"></a>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or
A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal modulus zero</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-modulus-zero"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most
numbers don&rsquo;t take to this kindly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal number of bits in vec</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-number-of-bits-in-vec"></a>
<p>(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be a power of
two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal octal digit %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-octal-digit-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-octal-digit-_0025s-ignored"></a>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number.
Interpretation of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: -%c</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Illegal-switch-in-PERL5OPT_003a-_002d_0025c"></a>
<p>(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the
following switches: <strong>-[CDIMUdmtw]</strong>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ill_002dformed-CRTL-environ-value-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL&rsquo;s
internal environ array, and encountered an element without the <code>=</code>
delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Ill_002dformed-message-in-prime_005fenv_005fiter_003a-_007c_0025s_007c"></a>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical
name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and
didn&rsquo;t see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>(in cleanup) %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0028in-cleanup_0029-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.
</p>
<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code>G_KEEPERR</code> flag could
also result in this warning.  See <a href="perlcall.html#perlcall-G_005fKEEPERR">perlcall G_KEEPERR</a>.

<p>(F) You used a pattern that references itself without consuming any input
text.  You should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
either consume text or fail.
</p>
<p>The &lt;&ndash; HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.

<dt>Initialization of state variables in list context currently forbidden</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Initialization-of-state-variables-in-list-context-currently-forbidden"></a>
<p>(F) Currently the implementation of &quot;state&quot; only permits the
initialization of scalar variables in scalar context.  Re-write
<code>state ($a) = 42</code> as <code>state $a = 42</code> to change from list to scalar

<p>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn&rsquo;t like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you&rsquo;re running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <strong>-T</strong> to turn it on explicitly.  The
tainting mechanism labels all data that&rsquo;s derived directly or indirectly
from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any
such data is used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get this error.  See

On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally&ndash;subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.

<dt>Integer overflow in version</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Integer-overflow-in-version"></a>
<p>(F) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for the
size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning
because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use a
element larger than typically 2**32.  This is usually caused by
trying to use some odd mathematical operation as a version, like
100/9.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Internal-inconsistency-in-tracking-vforks"></a>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number of times
you&rsquo;ve called <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>, to determine whether the current call
to <code>exec</code> should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
<a href="perlvms.html#perlvms-exec-LIST">perlvms exec LIST</a>).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this <code>exec</code> as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.

must have a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; character.  Otherwise, the leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; is
optional.  Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a
trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character

<p>(W) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one is too large
for the underlying floating point representation to store accurately,
hence the target of <code>++</code> or <code>--</code> is unchanged.  Perl issues this warning
because it has already switched from integers to floating point when values

</p>
<p>If you use the <code>:encoding(UTF-8)</code> PerlIO layer for input, invalid byte
sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use <code>:utf8</code>, the flag is
set without validating the data, possibly resulting in this error

<p>(F) Perl aborted due to too high a number of signals pending.  This
usually indicates that your operating system tried to deliver signals
too fast (with a very high priority), starving the perl process from
resources it would need to reach a point where it can process signals
safely.  (See <a href="perlipc.html#perlipc-Deferred-Signals-_0028Safe-Signals_0029">perlipc Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)</a>.)

<p>(F) Wrong syntax of character name literal <code>\N{charname}</code> within
double-quotish context.  This can also happen when there is a space
(or comment) between the <code>\N</code> and the <code>{</code> in a regex with the <code>/x</code> modifier.
This modifier does not change the requirement that the brace immediately
follow the <code>\N</code>.

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Missing $ on loop variable</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Missing-_0024-on-loop-variable"></a>

can vary from one line to the next.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>(Missing operator before %s?)</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0028Missing-operator-before-_0025s_003f_0029"></a>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
&quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;.  Often the missing operator is a comma.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Missing right brace on %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Missing-right-brace-on-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) Missing right brace in <code>\x{...}</code>, <code>\p{...}</code>, <code>\P{...}</code>, or <code>\N{...}</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Missing-right-brace-on-_005cN_007b_007d-or-unescaped-left-brace-after-_005cN"></a>
<p>(F) <code>\N</code> has two meanings.
</p>
<p>The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces,
meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name.  Thus <code>\N{ASTERISK}</code> is another way of writing <code>*</code>, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns,
it doesn&rsquo;t have the meaning an unescaped <code>*</code> does.
</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.12.0, <code>\N</code> also can have an additional meaning (only)
in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short
for <code>[^\n]</code>, and like <code>.</code> but is not affected by the <code>/s</code> regex modifier.)
</p>
<p>This can lead to some ambiguities.  When <code>\N</code> is not followed immediately
by a left brace, Perl assumes the <code>[^\n]</code> meaning.  Also, if the braces
form a valid quantifier such as <code>\N{3}</code> or <code>\N{5,}</code>, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a
<code>\N{</code> and a matching <code>}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.
</p>
<p>However, if there is no matching <code>}</code>, Perl doesn&rsquo;t know if it was
mistakenly omitted, or if <code>[^\n]{</code> was desired, and raises this error.
If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter,
escape the brace with a backslash, like so: <code>\N\{</code>
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Missing right curly or square bracket</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket"></a>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
ones.  As a general rule, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s missing near the place you
were last editing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0028Missing-semicolon-on-previous-line_003f_0029"></a>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
&quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;.  Don&rsquo;t automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Modification of a read-only value attempted</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Modification-of-a-read_002donly-value-attempted"></a>
<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn&rsquo;t, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
    mod(2);
</pre>
<p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that&rsquo;s off the end of the string.
</p>
<p>Yet another way is to assign to a <code>foreach</code> loop <em>VAR</em> when <em>VAR</em>
is aliased to a constant in the look <em>LIST</em>:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $x = 1;
    foreach my $n ($x, 2) {
        $n *= 2; # modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to
    }            # modify the 2
</pre>

<dt>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Modification-of-non_002dcreatable-array-value-attempted_002c-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Modification-of-non_002dcreatable-hash-value-attempted_002c-_0025s"></a>
<p>(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it
couldn&rsquo;t be created for some peculiar reason.

</dd>
<dt>Module name must be constant</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Module-name-must-be-constant"></a>

</dd>
<dt>Module name required with -%c option</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Module-name-required-with-_002d_0025c-option"></a>
<p>(F) The <code>-M</code> or <code>-m</code> options say that Perl should load some module, but
you omitted the name of the module.  Consult <a href="perlrun.html#perlrun-NAME">perlrun NAME</a> for full details
about <code>-M</code> and <code>-m</code>.
</p>

<dt>More than one argument to &rsquo;%s&rsquo; open</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-More-than-one-argument-to-_0027_0025s_0027-open"></a>
<p>(F) The <code>open</code> function has been asked to open multiple files.  This
can happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that takes a
list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a piped open mode.
See <a href="../perlfunc/open.html#open">(perlfunc)open</a> for details.

<p>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, but this did not
follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value.
See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<p>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.  Don&rsquo;t try
that yet.

<dt>&quot;my&quot; variable %s can&rsquo;t be in a package</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0022my_0022-variable-_0025s-can_0027t-be-in-a-package"></a>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
local() if you want to localize a package variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used only once: possible typo</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Name-_0022_0025s_003a_003a_0025s_0022-used-only-once_003a-possible-typo"></a>
<p>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.  The <code>our</code> declaration is
provided for this purpose.
</p>
<p>NOTE: This warning detects symbols that have been used only once so $c, @c,
%c, *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.

<dt>\N in a character class must be a named character: \N{...}</dt>

<p>(F) The new (5.12) meaning of <code>\N</code> as <code>[^\n]</code> is not valid in a bracketed
character class, for the same reason that <code>.</code> in a character class loses
its specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not
what you want.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_005cN_007bNAME_007d-must-be-resolved-by-the-lexer"></a>
<p>(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
sequence was encountered.  This can happen in any of several ways that
bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
backslash in double-quotish:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $re = '\N{SPACE}';  # Wrong!
    $re = &quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;; # Wrong!
    /$re/;
</pre>
<p>Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $re = &quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;;  # ok
    /$re/;
</pre>
<p>The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller
components:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $re = '\N';
    /${re}{SPACE}/;     # Wrong!
</pre>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this, and it
doesn&rsquo;t work here.  Instead use the solution above.
</p>
<p>Finally, the message also can happen under the <code>/x</code> regex modifier when the
<code>\N</code> is separated by spaces from the <code>{</code>, in which case, remove the spaces.
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    /\N {SPACE}/x;      # Wrong!
    /\N{SPACE}/x;       # ok
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Negative &rsquo;/&rsquo; count in unpack</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Negative-_0027_002f_0027-count-in-unpack"></a>
<p>(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack operation was
negative.  See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Negative length</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Negative-length"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer
length that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Negative-offset-to-vec-in-lvalue-context"></a>
<p>(F) When <code>vec</code> is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;&ndash; HERE in m/%s/</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Nested-quantifiers-in-regex_003b-marked-by-_003c_002d_002d-HERE-in-m_002f_0025s_002f"></a>
<p>(F) You can&rsquo;t quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses.
So things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.  The &lt;&ndash; HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
</p>
<p>Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, <code>*?</code>, <code>+?</code>, and
<code>??</code> appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren&rsquo;t.  See <a href="../perlre/index.html">(perlre)</a>.

<p>(F) <code>next::method</code> needs to be called within the context of a
real method in a real package, and it could not find such a context.
See <a href="../mro/index.html">(mro)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>No %s allowed while running setuid</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-No-_0025s-allowed-while-running-setuid"></a>
<p>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there
will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See <a href="perlsec.html#perlsec-NAME">perlsec NAME</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>No code specified for -%c</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-No-code-specified-for-_002d_0025c"></a>
<p>(F) Perl&rsquo;s <strong>-e</strong> and <strong>-E</strong> command-line options require an argument.  If
you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a separate
argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    perl -e &quot;&quot;
    perl -e0
    perl -e1
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>No comma allowed after %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-No-comma-allowed-after-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot; is
not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it&rsquo;d be just another one of the arguments.
</p>
<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported
a constant to your name space with <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating
system does not support that particular constant.  Hopefully you did
use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
please see <a href="../perlfunc/use.html#use">(perlfunc)use</a> and <a href="../perlfunc/import.html#import">(perlfunc)import</a>.  While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error earlier
it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating system
still does not support that constant.  Maybe you have a typo in
the constants of the symbol import list of <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> or in the
constant name at the line where this error was triggered?
</p>

<dt>No command into which to pipe on command line</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line"></a>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line

</p>
</dd>
<dt>No such pipe open</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-No-such-pipe-open"></a>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine my_pclose() tried to
close a pipe which hadn&rsquo;t been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>No such signal: SIG%s</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Not a CODE reference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Not-a-CODE-reference"></a>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a

or arrays beginning explicitly with <code>@</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Not a SCALAR reference</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Not-a-SCALAR-reference"></a>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="../perlref/index.html">(perlref)</a>.
</p>

yourself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-no-UTC-offset-information_003b-assuming-local-time-is-UTC"></a>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it&rsquo;s assuming that local system time is equivalent
to UTC.  If it&rsquo;s not, define the logical name
<samp>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</samp> to translate to the number of seconds which
need to be added to UTC to get local time.

<dd><a name="perldiag-Non_002dstring-passed-as-bitmask"></a>
<p>(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to select().
Use the vec() function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for
select.  See <a href="../perlfunc/select.html#select">(perlfunc)select</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Null filename used</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Null-filename-used"></a>
<p>(F) You can&rsquo;t require the null filename, especially because on many
machines that means the current directory!  See <a href="../perlfunc/require.html#require">(perlfunc)require</a>.
</p>

pointer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Null picture in formline</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Null-picture-in-formline"></a>
<p>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See <a href="../perlform/index.html">(perlform)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Null realloc</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Null-realloc"></a>
<p>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.

<dd><a name="perldiag-NULL-regexp-parameter"></a>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Number too long</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Number-too-long"></a>
<p>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to
about 250 characters.  You&rsquo;ve exceeded that length.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In
the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of
&quot;1_000_000&quot;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Number with no digits</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Number-with-no-digits"></a>
<p>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like
a number.  This happens, for example with <code>\o{}</code>, with no number between
the braces.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Octal-number-_003e-037777777777-non_002dportable"></a>
<p>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html#perlport-NAME">perlport NAME</a> for more on portability concerns.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Odd-number-of-arguments-for-overload_003a_003aconstant"></a>
<p>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
arguments.  The arguments should come in pairs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Odd-number-of-elements-in-anonymous-hash"></a>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Odd-number-of-elements-in-hash-assignment"></a>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Offset outside string</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Offset-outside-string"></a>
<p>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation
with an offset pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to
imagine.  The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will
take place when going past the end of the string when either
<code>sysread()</code>ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened
for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behaviour
with real files).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s() on unopened %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s_0028_0029-on-unopened-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was
never initialized.  You need to do an open(), a sysopen(), or a socket()
call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle package.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_002d_0025s-on-unopened-filehandle-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle
that isn&rsquo;t open.  Check your control flow.  See also <a href="../perlfunc/_002dX.html#g_t_002dX">(perlfunc)-X</a>.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Opening-dirhandle-_0025s-also-as-a-file"></a>
<p>(W io, deprecated) You used open() to associate a filehandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Opening-filehandle-_0025s-also-as-a-directory"></a>
<p>(W io, deprecated) You used opendir() to associate a dirhandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.
</p>

<dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no method found, %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Operation-_0022_0025s_0022_003a-no-method-found_002c-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless
the <code>fallback</code> overloading key is specified to be true.  See <a href="../overload/index.html">(overload)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Operation-_0022_0025s_0022-returns-its-argument-for-non_002dUnicode-code-point-0x_0025X"></a>
<p>(W utf8, non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do
is not defined.  Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.
</p>
<p>If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.
</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<code>no warnings 'non_unicode';</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Operation-_0022_0025s_0022-returns-its-argument-for-UTF_002d16-surrogate-U_002b_0025X"></a>
<p>(W utf8, surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
semantics on a Unicode surrogate.  Unicode frowns upon the use of
surrogates for anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but semantics
are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do
nothing for this operation.  Because the use of surrogates can be
dangerous, Perl warns.
</p>
<p>If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that case-insensitive
matching in a regular expression was done on the code point.
</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<code>no warnings 'surrogate';</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-_0025s"></a>
<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be interpreted as if you said
&quot;*foo * &rsquo;foo&rsquo;&quot;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0022our_0022-variable-_0025s-redeclared"></a>
<p>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
in the current lexical scope.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Out of memory!</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Out-of-memory_0021"></a>
<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has
no option but to exit immediately.
</p>
<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use <code>limit</code> and
<code>limit datasize n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the number of kilobytes) to check
the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use <code>ulimit -a</code>
and <code>ulimit -d n</code>, respectively.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Out of memory during %s extend</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Out-of-memory-during-_0025s-extend"></a>
<p>(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond
the largest possible memory allocation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Out of memory during &quot;large&quot; request for %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Out-of-memory-during-_0022large_0022-request-for-_0025s"></a>
<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Out of memory during request for %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Out-of-memory-during-request-for-_0025s"></a>
<p>(X)(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.
</p>
<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code>$^M</code> as an
emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable <em>once</em>, and the error message will include the line and file
where the failed request happened.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Out-of-memory-during-ridiculously-large-request"></a>
<p>(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
<code>$arr[time]</code> instead of <code>$arr[$time]</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Out of memory for yacc stack</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Out-of-memory-for-yacc-stack"></a>
<p>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue
parsing, but realloc() wouldn&rsquo;t give it more memory, virtual or
otherwise.

<dd><a name="perldiag-_0027_0040_0027-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a>

<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-package-attribute-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word_003a-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
package-specific handler.  That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
some day, even though it doesn&rsquo;t yet.  Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead.  See <a href="../attributes/index.html">(attributes)</a>.

<p>Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the
settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating
system supplier and/or system administrator have set up the so-called
locale system but Perl could not use those settings.  This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that
Perl can and will use, and the script will be run.  Before you really
fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each

<dt>Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Possible-attempt-to-put-comments-in-qw_0028_0029-list"></a>
<p>(W qw) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal

literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the
parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)

<dt>Possible attempt to separate words with commas</dt>

<p>(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the
end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and
Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See <a href="../perlfunc/ioctl.html#ioctl">(perlfunc)ioctl</a>.

<dt>Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator</dt>

with a numeric comparison operator, like this :
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }
</pre>
<p>This expression is actually equivalent to <code>$x &amp; ($y == 0)</code>, due to the
higher precedence of <code>==</code>.  This is probably not what you want.  (If you
really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, better, put the
parentheses explicitly and write <code>$x &amp; ($y == 0)</code>).

The regex <code>m/foo$\s+bar/m</code> translates to: match the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo;, the output
record separator (see <a href="perlvar.html#perlvar-_0024_005c">perlvar $\</a>) and the letter &rsquo;s&rsquo; (one time or more)
followed by the word &rsquo;bar&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning by using 
<code>m/${\}/</code> (for example: <code>m/foo${\}s+bar/</code>).
</p>
<p>If instead you intended to match the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo; at the end of the line
followed by whitespace and the word &rsquo;bar&rsquo; on the next line then you can use
<code>m/$(?)\/</code> (for example: <code>m/foo$(?)\s+bar/</code>).

<dd><a name="perldiag-Precedence-problem_003a-open-_0025s-should-be-open_0028_0025s_0029"></a>
<p>(S precedence) The old irregular construct

<pre class="verbatim">    open FOO || die;
</pre>
<p>is now misinterpreted as
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    open(FOO || die);
</pre>
<p>because of the strict regularization of Perl 5&rsquo;s grammar into unary and
list operators.  (The old open was a little of both.)  You must put
parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new &quot;or&quot; operator instead
of &quot;||&quot;.

<dt>\p{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_005cp_007b_007d-uses-Unicode-rules_002c-not-locale-rules"></a>
<p>(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a Unicode property
match (<code>\p</code> or <code>\P</code>), but the regular expression is also being told to
use the run-time locale, not Unicode.  Instead, use a POSIX character
class, which should know about the locale&rsquo;s rules.
(See <a href="../perlrecharclass/POSIX-Character-Classes.html#POSIX-Character-Classes">(perlrecharclass)POSIX Character Classes</a>.)
</p>
<p>Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a subset of
Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid for that
subset.
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples to help you see what&rsquo;s going on.  If the
locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the &quot;GREEK
CAPITAL LETTER CHI&quot;.  But in Unicode that code point means the
&quot;MULTIPLICATION SIGN&quot; instead, and <code>\p</code> always uses the Unicode
meaning.  That means that <code>\p{Alpha}</code> won&rsquo;t match, but <code>[[:alpha:]]</code>
should.  Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode.  But, even here, some properties give
incorrect results.  An example is <code>\p{Changes_When_Uppercased}</code> which
is true for &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;, but since the upper
case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn&rsquo;t
change when upper cased.

<p>(W regexp) You applied a regular expression quantifier in a place where
it makes no sense, such as on a zero-width assertion.  Try putting the

<p>(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a

<p>(F) You used a regular expression extension that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  The

discovered.  This happens when using the <code>(?^...)</code> construct to tell
Perl to use the default regular expression modifiers, and you
redundantly specify a default modifier.  For other

<dt>Server error</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Server-error"></a>
<p>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window
when trying to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web.  The
actual error text varies widely from server to server.  The most
frequently-seen variants are &quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something)
not permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;, &quot;Premature end of script
headers&quot;, and &quot;Did not produce a valid header&quot;.
</p>
<p><strong>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</strong>.
</p>
<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by
the user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the
user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment
variables (like PATH) from the user it isn&rsquo;t running under, and isn&rsquo;t
in a location where the CGI server can&rsquo;t find it, basically, more or
less.  Please see the following for more information:

<dd><a name="perldiag-_0021_003d_007e-should-be-_0021_007e"></a>
<p>(W syntax) The non-matching operator is !~, not !=~.  !=~ will be
interpreted as the != (numeric not equal) and ~ (1&rsquo;s complement)
operators: probably not what you intended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lt;&gt; should be quotes</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_003c_003e-should-be-quotes"></a>

<dd><a name="perldiag-_002f_0025s_002f-should-probably-be-written-as-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to <code>join</code>.  Perl will treat the true or false
result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string, which is
probably not what you had in mind.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>shutdown() on closed socket %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-shutdown_0028_0029-on-closed-socket-_0025s"></a>

<dt>Smart matching a non-overloaded object breaks encapsulation</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Smart-matching-a-non_002doverloaded-object-breaks-encapsulation"></a>
<p>(F) You should not use the <code>~~</code> operator on an object that does not
overload it: Perl refuses to use the object&rsquo;s underlying structure for
the smart match.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>sort is now a reserved word</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-sort-is-now-a-reserved-word"></a>
<p>(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sort subroutine didn&rsquo;t return single value</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Sort-subroutine-didn_0027t-return-single-value"></a>
<p>(F) A sort comparison subroutine may not return a list value with more
or less than one element.  See <a href="../perlfunc/sort.html#sort">(perlfunc)sort</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Source filters apply only to byte streams</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Source-filters-apply-only-to-byte-streams"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to activate a source filter (usually by loading a
source filter module) within a string passed to <code>eval</code>.  This is
not permitted under the <code>unicode_eval</code> feature.  Consider using
<code>evalbytes</code> instead.  See <a href="../feature/index.html">(feature)</a>.

</dd>
<dt>splice() offset past end of array</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-splice_0028_0029-offset-past-end-of-array"></a>
<p>(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of
the array passed to splice().  Splicing will instead commence at the
end of the array, rather than past it.  If this isn&rsquo;t what you want,
try explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array = $offset.
See <a href="../perlfunc/splice.html#splice">(perlfunc)splice</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Split loop</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Split-loop"></a>
<p>(P) The split was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a split shouldn&rsquo;t
iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.)  See <a href="../perlfunc/split.html#split">(perlfunc)split</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Statement unlikely to be reached</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Statement-unlikely-to-be-reached"></a>
<p>(W exec) You did an exec() with some statement after it other than a
die().  This is almost always an error, because exec() never returns
unless there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use system()
instead, which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the exec() in
a block by itself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;state&quot; variable %s can&rsquo;t be in a package</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0022state_0022-variable-_0025s-can_0027t-be-in-a-package"></a>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
local() if you want to localize a package variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>stat() on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-stat_0028_0029-on-unopened-filehandle-_0025s"></a>

<p>(P) Overloading resolution over @ISA tree may be broken by importation
stubs.  Stubs should never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to
<code>can</code> may break this.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Subroutine %s redefined</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Subroutine-_0025s-redefined"></a>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine.  To suppress this warning, say

        eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;;
    }
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>Substitution loop</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Substitution-loop"></a>
<p>(P) The substitution was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a substitution
shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more times than there are characters of input, which
is what happened.)  See the discussion of substitution in
<a href="../perlop/Regexp-Quote_002dLike-Operators.html#Regexp-Quote_002dLike-Operators">(perlop)Regexp Quote-Like Operators</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Substitution pattern not terminated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Substitution-pattern-not-terminated"></a>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading <code>$</code> from variable <code>$s</code> may cause this error.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Substitution replacement not terminated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Substitution-replacement-not-terminated"></a>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the final delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading <code>$</code> from variable <code>$s</code> may cause this error.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>substr outside of string</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-substr-outside-of-string"></a>
<p>(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the
length of the string.  See <a href="../perlfunc/substr.html#substr">(perlfunc)substr</a>.  This warning is fatal if
substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side of an
assignment or as a subroutine argument for example).
</p>

<dd><a name="perldiag-sv_005fupgrade-from-type-_0025d-down-to-type-_0025d"></a>
<p>(P) Perl tried to force the upgrade of an SV to a type which was actually
inferior to its current type.

<p>(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have at most
two branches (the if-clause and the else-clause).  If you want one or
both to contain alternation, such as using <code>this|that|other</code>, enclose
it in clustering parentheses:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    (?(condition)(?:this|that|other)|else-clause)

<p>(F) If the argument to the (?(...)if-clause|else-clause) construct is
a number, it can be only a number.  The &lt;&ndash; HERE shows in the regular

<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-syntax-OK"></a>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code>perl -c</code> succeeds.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>syntax error</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-syntax-error"></a>
<p>(F) Probably means you had a syntax error.  Common reasons include:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    A keyword is misspelled.
    A semicolon is missing.
    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.
    A closing quote is missing.
</pre>
<p>Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <strong>-w</strong>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what&rsquo;s triggering the error is to call
<code>perl -c</code> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20&nbsp;questions<!-- /@w -->.

yourself.

<p>(F) This error is likely to occur if you run a perl5 script through
a perl4 interpreter, especially if the next 2 tokens are &quot;use strict&quot;

<dt>System V %s is not implemented on this machine</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-System-V-_0025s-is-not-implemented-on-this-machine"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to do something with a function beginning with &quot;sem&quot;,
&quot;shm&quot;, or &quot;msg&quot; but that System V IPC is not implemented in your
machine.  In some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured.  Consult your system support.

<dt>syswrite() on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-syswrite_0028_0029-on-closed-filehandle-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your control flow.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-T</code> and <code>-B</code> not implemented on filehandles</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_002dT-and-_002dB-not-implemented-on-filehandles"></a>
<p>(F) Perl can&rsquo;t peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn&rsquo;t
know about your kind of stdio.  You&rsquo;ll have to use a filename instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Target of goto is too deeply nested</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Target-of-goto-is-too-deeply-nested"></a>
<p>(F) You tried to use <code>goto</code> to reach a label that was too deeply nested
for Perl to reach.  Perl is doing you a favor by refusing.
</p>
</dd>

<dd><a name="perldiag-telldir_0028_0029-attempted-on-invalid-dirhandle-_0025s"></a>

a dirhandle.  Check your control flow.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>tell() on unopened filehandle</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-tell_0028_0029-on-unopened-filehandle"></a>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to use the tell() function on a filehandle that

</p>
</dd>
<dt>That use of $[ is unsupported</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-That-use-of-_0024_005b-is-unsupported"></a>
<p>(F) Assignment to <code>$[</code> is now strictly circumscribed, and interpreted
as a compiler directive.  You may say only one of
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $[ = 0;
    $[ = 1;
    ...
    local $[ = 0;
    local $[ = 1;

<p>This is to prevent the problem of one module changing the array base out

<dd><a name="perldiag-The-crypt_0028_0029-function-is-unimplemented-due-to-excessive-paranoia"></a>
<p>(F) Configure couldn&rsquo;t find the crypt() function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn&rsquo;t supply it, probably because they
think the U.S. Government thinks it&rsquo;s a secret, or at least that they
will continue to pretend that it is.  And if you quote me on that, I
will deny it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>The %s function is unimplemented</dt>

<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains
the <strong>-T</strong> option (or the <strong>-t</strong> option), but Perl was not invoked with
<strong>-T</strong> in its command line.  This is an error because, by the time
Perl discovers a <strong>-T</strong> in a script, it&rsquo;s too late to properly taint
everything from the environment.  So Perl gives up.
</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be
fixed by editing the #! line so that the <strong>-%c</strong> option is a part of
Perl&rsquo;s first argument: e.g. change <code>perl -n -%c</code> to <code>perl -%c -n</code>.

<p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code>perl scriptname</code>, then the

<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<strong>-M</strong>, <strong>-m</strong> or <strong>-C</strong> option.
</p>
<p>In the case of <strong>-M</strong> and <strong>-m</strong>, this is an error because those options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the <code>use</code> pragma instead.
</p>
<p>The <strong>-C</strong> option only works if it is specified on the command line as
well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers following).  Either
specify this option on the command line, or, if your system supports
it, make your script executable and run it directly instead of passing
it to perl.

not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message
came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn

<dt>Unterminated attribute list</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Unterminated-attribute-list"></a>
<p>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the
start of an attribute, and it wasn&rsquo;t a semicolon or the start of a

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Unterminated-attribute-parameter-in-attribute-list"></a>
<p>(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing
an attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis
character was not found.  You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance.  See <a href="../attributes/index.html">(attributes)</a>.

not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.

<dt>Useless use of %s in void context</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Useless-use-of-_0025s-in-void-context"></a>
<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn&rsquo;t return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you&rsquo;d
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $one, $two = 1, 2;
</pre>
<p>when you meant to say
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
</pre>
<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $array = (1,2);
</pre>
<p>when you should have said
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $array = [1,2];
</pre>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C&rsquo;s comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
<a href="../perlref/index.html">(perlref)</a> for more on this.
</p>
<p>This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1
since they are often used in statements like
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    1 while sub_with_side_effects();

<dt>Useless use of %s with no values</dt>

<p>(W syntax) You used the push() or unshift() function with no arguments
apart from the array, like <code>push(@x)</code> or <code>unshift(@foo)</code>.  That won&rsquo;t
usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless.  It&rsquo;s
possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect
if the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method.  If so,
you can write it as <code>push(@tied_array,())</code> to avoid this warning.

<code>my $x : = 42</code> (applying an empty attribute list to <code>$x</code>).
This construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax
error, so <code>:=</code> can be reclaimed as a new operator in the future.

<dt>Use of freed value in iteration</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-freed-value-in-iteration"></a>

This error is typically caused by code like the following:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    @a = (3,4);
    @a = () for (1,2,@a);
</pre>
<p>You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over.
For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.

<dt>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_002fg-modifier-is-meaningless-in-split"></a>

<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_0022goto_0022-to-jump-into-a-construct-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) Using <code>goto</code> to jump from an outer scope into an inner

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non_002dmethod-_0025s_0028_0029-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code>AUTOLOAD</code>
subroutines are looked up as methods (using the <code>@ISA</code> hierarchy)
even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. <code>Foo::bar()</code>), not as methods (e.g. <code>Foo-&gt;bar()</code> or
<code>$obj-&gt;bar()</code>).
</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods&rsquo; <code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.
</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for non-methods from a base class
named <code>BaseClass</code>, execute <code>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</code> during
startup.
</p>
<p>In code that currently says <code>use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);</code>
you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code>use AutoLoader;</code> to
<code>use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';</code>.

</dd>
<dt>Use of %s in printf format not supported</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_0025s-in-printf-format-not-supported"></a>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of %s is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_0025s-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use,
generally because there&rsquo;s a better way to do it, and also because the
old way has bad side effects.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of -l on filehandle %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_002dl-on-filehandle-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file
it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
The operation returned <code>undef</code>.  Use a filename instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_0025s-on-a-handle-without-_002a-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You used <code>tie</code>, <code>tied</code> or <code>untie</code> on a scalar but that scalar
happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied.  If
you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as in <code>tie *$handle</code>.
</p>
<p>This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was
no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to
untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.  If you see this
message, you must be using an older version.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of ?PATTERN? without explicit operator is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-_003fPATTERN_003f-without-explicit-operator-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You have written something like <code>?\w?</code>, for a regular
expression that matches only once.  Starting this term directly with
the question mark delimiter is now deprecated, so that the question mark
will be available for use in new operators in the future.  Write <code>m?\w?</code>
instead, explicitly using the <code>m</code> operator: the question mark delimiter
still invokes match-once behaviour.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of qw(...) as parentheses is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-qw_0028_002e_002e_002e_0029-as-parentheses-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You have something like <code>foreach $x qw(a b c) {...}</code>,
using a <code>qw(...)</code> list literal where a parenthesised expression is
expected.  Historically the parser fooled itself into thinking that
<code>qw(...)</code> literals were always enclosed in parentheses, and as a result
you could sometimes omit parentheses around them.  (You could never do
the <code>foreach qw(a b c) {...}</code> that you might have expected, though.)
The parser no longer lies to itself in this way.  Wrap the list literal
in parentheses, like <code>foreach $x (qw(a b c)) {...}</code>.
</p>

<dt>Use of reference &quot;%s&quot; as array index</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-reference-_0022_0025s_0022-as-array-index"></a>
<p>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably
isn&rsquo;t what you mean, because references in numerical context tend
to be huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.
</p>
<p>If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:
<code>$array[0+$ref]</code>.  This warning is not given for overloaded objects,
however, because you can overload the numification and stringification
operators and then you presumably know what you are doing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of reserved word &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-reserved-word-_0022_0025s_0022-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you&rsquo;re better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be
suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a <code>&amp;</code> prefix, or using
a package qualifier, e.g. <code>&amp;our()</code>, or <code>Foo::our()</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-tainted-arguments-in-_0025s-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied <code>system()</code> or <code>exec()</code> with multiple
arguments and at least one of them is tainted.  This used to be allowed
but will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.  Untaint your
arguments.  See <a href="perlsec.html#perlsec-NAME">perlsec NAME</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use of uninitialized value%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Use-of-uninitialized-value_0025s"></a>
<p>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.
</p>
<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you
the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases
it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the
undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
anid the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
literally in your program.  For example, <code>&quot;that $foo&quot;</code> is usually
optimized into <code>&quot;that &quot; . $foo</code>, and the warning will refer to the
<code>concatenation (.)</code> operator, even though there is no <code>.</code> in
your program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Using a hash as a reference is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Using-a-hash-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
<code>%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}</code> or <code>%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}</code>.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t have.   It is now
deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Using an array as a reference is deprecated</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Using-an-array-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
<code>@foo-&gt;[23]</code> or <code>@$ref-&gt;[99]</code>.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to
allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t have.  It is now deprecated,

<dd><a name="perldiag-Using-_0021_007e-with-_0025s-doesn_0027t-make-sense"></a>
<p>(F) Using the <code>!~</code> operator with <code>s///r</code>, <code>tr///r</code> or <code>y///r</code> is
currently reserved for future use, as the exact behaviour has not
been decided.  (Simply returning the boolean opposite of the

<dt>UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-UTF_002d16-surrogate-U_002b_0025X"></a>
<p>(W utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
not considered acceptable.  These code points, between U+D800 and
U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16.  However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit
available on your platform), including surrogates.  But these can cause
problems when being input or output, which is likely where this message
came from.  If you really really know what you are doing you can turn
off this warning by <code>no warnings 'surrogate';</code>.

<p>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<code>each()</code>, or <code>readdir()</code> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the conditional expression
false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these
constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<code>defined</code> operator.

<dt>Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Value-of-CLI-symbol-_0022_0025s_0022-too-long"></a>
<p>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an
%ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string
longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to
1024 characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Variable-_0022_0025s_0022-is-not-available"></a>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons.  First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.)  For example,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
</pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can&rsquo;t capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn&rsquo;t been created yet.  Conversely,
the following won&rsquo;t give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();
</pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
</pre>
<p>Here, when the &rsquo;$a&rsquo; in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its $a is not available for capture.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Variable-_0022_0025s_0022-is-not-imported_0025s"></a>
<p>(W misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in m/%s/</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Variable-length-lookbehind-not-implemented-in-m_002f_0025s_002f"></a>
<p>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and
known at compile time.  See <a href="../perlre/index.html">(perlre)</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0022_0025s_0022-variable-_0025s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W misc) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the
previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note
that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope
or until all closure referents to it are destroyed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Variable syntax</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Variable-syntax"></a>
<p>(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Variable-_0022_0025s_0022-will-not-stay-shared"></a>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <em>named</em> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.
</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine&rsquo;s variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.
</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code>sub {}</code> syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.

<p>(W internal) The %vd (s)printf format does not support version objects
with alpha parts.

<p>(F) You used a verb pattern that requires an argument.  Supply an
argument or check that you are using the right verb.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Verb pattern &rsquo;%s&rsquo; may not have an argument in regex; marked by &lt;&ndash; HERE in m/%s/</dt>

<p>(F) You used a verb pattern that is not allowed an argument.  Remove the 
argument or check that you are using the right verb.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version number must be a constant number</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Version-number-must-be-a-constant-number"></a>
<p>(P) The attempt to translate a <code>use Module n.n LIST</code> statement into
its equivalent <code>BEGIN</code> block found an internal inconsistency with
the version number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version string &rsquo;%s&rsquo; contains invalid data; ignoring: &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Version-string-_0027_0025s_0027-contains-invalid-data_003b-ignoring_003a-_0027_0025s_0027"></a>
<p>(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which
are being ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Warning: something&rsquo;s wrong</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Warning_003a-something_0027s-wrong"></a>
<p>(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of <code>warn &quot;&quot;</code>) or
you called it with no args and <code>$@</code> was empty.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Warning_003a-unable-to-close-filehandle-_0025s-properly"></a>
<p>(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication on
the close().  This usually indicates your file system ran out of disk
space.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot; without parentheses is ambiguous</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Warning_003a-Use-of-_0022_0025s_0022-without-parentheses-is-ambiguous"></a>
<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that
looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a
term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    rand + 5;
</pre>
<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    rand() + 5;
</pre>
<p>but in actual fact, you got
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    rand(+5);
</pre>
<p>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Wide character in %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Wide-character-in-_0025s"></a>
<p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn&rsquo;t expecting
one.  This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).  The easiest
way to quiet this warning is simply to add the <code>:utf8</code> layer to the
output, e.g. <code>binmode STDOUT, ':utf8'</code>.  Another way to turn off the
warning is to add <code>no warnings 'utf8';</code> but that is often closer to
cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the
filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="../open/index.html">(open)</a> and <a href="../perlfunc/binmode.html#binmode">(perlfunc)binmode</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Within []-length &rsquo;%c&rsquo; not allowed</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Within-_005b_005d_002dlength-_0027_0025c_0027-not-allowed"></a>
<p>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by <code>[TEMPLATE]</code>
only if <code>TEMPLATE</code> always matches the same amount of packed bytes that
can be determined from the template alone.  This is not possible if
it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length.  Redesign
the template.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>write() on closed filehandle %s</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-write_0028_0029-on-closed-filehandle-_0025s"></a>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your control flow.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0025s-_0022_005cx_0025X_0022-does-not-map-to-Unicode"></a>
<p>(F) When reading in different encodings Perl tries to map everything
into Unicode characters.  The bytes you read in are not legal in
this encoding, for example
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode
</pre>
<p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&rsquo;X&rsquo; outside of string</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0027X_0027-outside-of-string"></a>
<p>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being (un)packed.  See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&rsquo;x&rsquo; outside of string in unpack</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-_0027x_0027-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a>
<p>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after
the end of the string being unpacked.  See <a href="../perlfunc/pack.html#pack">(perlfunc)pack</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>YOU HAVEN&rsquo;T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-YOU-HAVEN_0027T-DISABLED-SET_002dID-SCRIPTS-IN-THE-KERNEL-YET_0021"></a>
<p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don&rsquo;t have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn&rsquo;t give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around
your script.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>You need to quote &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-You-need-to-quote-_0022_0025s_0022"></a>
<p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS
what you want, put an &amp; in front.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Your random numbers are not that random</dt>
<dd><a name="perldiag-Your-random-numbers-are-not-that-random"></a>
<p>(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could
not get any randomness out of your system.  This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.
