<p>The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions
is found in <a href="../perlre/index.html">(perlre)</a>.
</p>
<p>This manual page discusses the syntax and use of character
classes in Perl regular expressions.
</p>
<p>A character class is a way of denoting a set of characters
in such a way that one character of the set is matched.
It&rsquo;s important to remember that: matching a character class
consumes exactly one character in the source string. (The source
string is the string the regular expression is matched against.)
</p>
<p>There are three types of character classes in Perl regular
expressions: the dot, backslash sequences, and the form enclosed in square
brackets.  Keep in mind, though, that often the term &quot;character class&quot; is used
to mean just the bracketed form.  Certainly, most Perl documentation does that.

<h4 class="subsection">61.2.1 The dot</h4>

<p>The dot (or period), <code>.</code> is probably the most used, and certainly
the most well-known character class. By default, a dot matches any
character, except for the newline. That default can be changed to
add matching the newline by using the <em>single line</em> modifier: either
for the entire regular expression with the <code>/s</code> modifier, or
locally with <code>(?s)</code>.  (The experimental <code>\N</code> backslash sequence, described
below, matches any character except newline without regard to the
<em>single line</em> modifier.)
</p>
<p>Here are some examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> &quot;a&quot;  =~  /./       # Match
 &quot;.&quot;  =~  /./       # Match
 &quot;&quot;   =~  /./       # No match (dot has to match a character)
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./       # No match (dot does not match a newline)
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./s      # Match (global 'single line' modifier)
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /(?s:.)/  # Match (local 'single line' modifier)
 &quot;ab&quot; =~  /^.$/     # No match (dot matches one character)

<p>A backslash sequence is a sequence of characters, the first one of which is a
backslash.  Perl ascribes special meaning to many such sequences, and some of
these are character classes.  That is, they match a single character each,
provided that the character belongs to the specific set of characters defined
by the sequence.
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of the backslash sequences that are character classes.  They
are discussed in more detail below.  (For the backslash sequences that aren&rsquo;t
character classes, see <a href="perlrebackslash.html#perlrebackslash-NAME">perlrebackslash NAME</a>.)

<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.2.1 \N</h4>

<p><code>\N</code> is new in 5.12, and is experimental.  It, like the dot, matches any
character that is not a newline. The difference is that <code>\N</code> is not influenced
by the <em>single line</em> regular expression modifier (see <a href="#NAME-character-class-The-dot">The dot</a> above).  Note
that the form <code>\N{...}</code> may mean something completely different.  When the
<code>{...}</code> is a <a href="../perlre/Quantifiers.html#Quantifiers">(perlre)quantifier</a>, it means to match a non-newline
character that many times.  For example, <code>\N{3}</code> means to match 3
non-newlines; <code>\N{5,}</code> means to match 5 or more non-newlines.  But if <code>{...}</code>
is not a legal quantifier, it is presumed to be a named character.  See
<a href="../charnames/index.html">(charnames)</a> for those.  For example, none of <code>\N{COLON}</code>, <code>\N{4F}</code>, and
<code>\N{F4}</code> contain legal quantifiers, so Perl will try to find characters whose
names are respectively <code>COLON</code>, <code>4F</code>, and <code>F4</code>.

<a name="Digits"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.2.2 Digits</h4>

<p><code>\d</code> matches a single character considered to be a decimal <em>digit</em>.
If the <code>/a</code> regular expression modifier is in effect, it matches [0-9].
Otherwise, it
matches anything that is matched by <code>\p{Digit}</code>, which includes [0-9].
(An unlikely possible exception is that under locale matching rules, the
current locale might not have [0-9] matched by <code>\d</code>, and/or might match
other characters whose code point is less than 256.  Such a locale
definition would be in violation of the C language standard, but Perl
doesn&rsquo;t currently assume anything in regard to this.)
</p>
<p>What this means is that unless the <code>/a</code> modifier is in effect <code>\d</code> not
only matches the digits &rsquo;0&rsquo; - &rsquo;9&rsquo;, but also Arabic, Devanagari, and
digits from other languages.  This may cause some confusion, and some
security issues.
</p>
<p>Some digits that <code>\d</code> matches look like some of the [0-9] ones, but
have different values.  For example, BENGALI DIGIT FOUR (U+09EA) looks
very much like an ASCII DIGIT EIGHT (U+0038).  An application that
is expecting only the ASCII digits might be misled, or if the match is
<code>\d+</code>, the matched string might contain a mixture of digits from
different writing systems that look like they signify a number different
than they actually do.  <a href="../Unicode-UCD/num_0028_0029.html#num_0028_0029">(Unicode-UCD)num()</a> can
be used to safely
calculate the value, returning <code>undef</code> if the input string contains
such a mixture.
</p>
<p>What <code>\p{Digit}</code> means (and hence <code>\d</code> except under the <code>/a</code>
modifier) is <code>\p{General_Category=Decimal_Number}</code>, or synonymously,
<code>\p{General_Category=Digit}</code>.  Starting with Unicode version 4.1, this
is the same set of characters matched by <code>\p{Numeric_Type=Decimal}</code>.
But Unicode also has a different property with a similar name,
<code>\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}</code>, which matches a completely different set of
characters.  These characters are things such as <code>CIRCLED DIGIT ONE</code>
or subscripts, or are from writing systems that lack all ten digits.
</p>
<p>The design intent is for <code>\d</code> to exactly match the set of characters
that can safely be used with &quot;normal&quot; big-endian positional decimal
syntax, where, for example 123 means one &rsquo;hundred&rsquo;, plus two &rsquo;tens&rsquo;,
plus three &rsquo;ones&rsquo;.  This positional notation does not necessarily apply
to characters that match the other type of &quot;digit&quot;,
<code>\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}</code>, and so <code>\d</code> doesn&rsquo;t match them.
</p>
<p>The Tamil digits (U+0BE6 - U+0BEF) can also legally be
used in old-style Tamil numbers in which they would appear no more than
one in a row, separated by characters that mean &quot;times 10&quot;, &quot;times 100&quot;,
etc.  (See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21">http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21</a>.)
</p>
<p>Any character not matched by <code>\d</code> is matched by <code>\D</code>.

<p>A <code>\w</code> matches a single alphanumeric character (an alphabetic character, or a
decimal digit) or a connecting punctuation character, such as an
underscore (&quot;_&quot;).  It does not match a whole word.  To match a whole
word, use <code>\w+</code>.  This isn&rsquo;t the same thing as matching an English word, but
in the ASCII range it is the same as a string of Perl-identifier
characters.

</p>
<p>Note that unlike <code>\s</code> (and <code>\d</code> and <code>\w</code>), <code>\h</code> and <code>\v</code> always match
the same characters, without regard to other factors, such as the active
locale or whether the source string is in UTF-8 format.
</p>
<p>One might think that <code>\s</code> is equivalent to <code>[\h\v]</code>. This is not true.
The difference is that the vertical tab (<code>&quot;\x0b&quot;</code>) is not matched by
<code>\s</code>; it is however considered vertical whitespace.
</p>
<p>The following table is a complete listing of characters matched by
<code>\s</code>, <code>\h</code> and <code>\v</code> as of Unicode 6.0.
</p>
<p>The first column gives the Unicode code point of the character (in hex format),
the second column gives the (Unicode) name. The third column indicates
by which class(es) the character is matched (assuming no locale or EBCDIC code
page is in effect that changes the <code>\s</code> matching).

<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.2.5 Unicode Properties</h4>

<p><code>\pP</code> and <code>\p{Prop}</code> are character classes to match characters that fit given
Unicode properties.  One letter property names can be used in the <code>\pP</code> form,
with the property name following the <code>\p</code>, otherwise, braces are required.
When using braces, there is a single form, which is just the property name
enclosed in the braces, and a compound form which looks like <code>\p{name=value}</code>,
which means to match if the property &quot;name&quot; for the character has that particular
&quot;value&quot;.
For instance, a match for a number can be written as <code>/\pN/</code> or as
<code>/\p{Number}/</code>, or as <code>/\p{Number=True}/</code>.
Lowercase letters are matched by the property <em>Lowercase_Letter</em> which
has the short form <em>Ll</em>. They need the braces, so are written as <code>/\p{Ll}/</code> or
<code>/\p{Lowercase_Letter}/</code>, or <code>/\p{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}/</code>
(the underscores are optional).
<code>/\pLl/</code> is valid, but means something different.
It matches a two character string: a letter (Unicode property <code>\pL</code>),
followed by a lowercase <code>l</code>.
</p>
<p>If neither the <code>/a</code> modifier nor locale rules are in effect, the use of
a Unicode property will force the regular expression into using Unicode
rules.
</p>
<p>Note that almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive matching.
That is, adding a <code>/i</code> regular expression modifier does not change what
they match.  There are two sets that are affected.  The first set is
<code>Uppercase_Letter</code>,
<code>Lowercase_Letter</code>,
and <code>Titlecase_Letter</code>,
all of which match <code>Cased_Letter</code> under <code>/i</code> matching.
The second set is
<code>Uppercase</code>,
<code>Lowercase</code>,
and <code>Titlecase</code>,
all of which match <code>Cased</code> under <code>/i</code> matching.
(The difference between these sets is that some things, such as Roman
numerals, come in both upper and lower case, so they are <code>Cased</code>, but
aren&rsquo;t considered to be letters, so they aren&rsquo;t <code>Cased_Letter</code>s. They&rsquo;re
actually <code>Letter_Number</code>s.)
This set also includes its subsets <code>PosixUpper</code> and <code>PosixLower</code>, both
of which under <code>/i</code> match <code>PosixAlpha</code>.
</p>
<p>For more details on Unicode properties, see <a href="perlunicode.html#perlunicode-Unicode-Character-Properties">perlunicode Unicode Character Properties</a>; for a
complete list of possible properties, see
<a href="../perluniprops/Properties-accessible-through-_005cp_007b_007d-and-_005cP_007b_007d.html#Properties-accessible-through-_005cp_007b_007d-and-_005cP_007b_007d">(perluniprops)Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}</a>,
which notes all forms that have <code>/i</code> differences.
It is also possible to define your own properties. This is discussed in
<a href="perlunicode.html#perlunicode-User_002dDefined-Character-Properties">perlunicode User-Defined Character Properties</a>.
</p>
<p>Unicode properties are defined (surprise!) only on Unicode code points.
A warning is raised and all matches fail on non-Unicode code points
(those above the legal Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF).  This can be
somewhat surprising,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}      # Fails.
 chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}     # Also fails!
</pre>
<p>Even though these two matches might be thought of as complements, they
are so only on Unicode code points.

<p>It is worth emphasizing that <code>\d</code>, <code>\w</code>, etc, match single characters, not
complete numbers or words. To match a number (that consists of digits),
use <code>\d+</code>; to match a word, use <code>\w+</code>.  But be aware of the security
considerations in doing so, as mentioned above.

<a name="Bracketed-Character-Classes"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">61.2.3 Bracketed Character Classes</h4>

<p>The third form of character class you can use in Perl regular expressions
is the bracketed character class.  In its simplest form, it lists the characters
that may be matched, surrounded by square brackets, like this: <code>[aeiou]</code>.
This matches one of <code>a</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>o</code> or <code>u</code>.  Like the other
character classes, exactly one character is matched.* To match
a longer string consisting of characters mentioned in the character
class, follow the character class with a <a href="../perlre/Quantifiers.html#Quantifiers">(perlre)quantifier</a>.  For
instance, <code>[aeiou]+</code> matches one or more lowercase English vowels.
</p>
<p>Repeating a character in a character class has no
effect; it&rsquo;s considered to be in the set only once.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # Match, as &quot;e&quot; is listed in the class.
 &quot;p&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # No match, &quot;p&quot; is not listed in the class.
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]$/      # No match, a character class only matches
                           # a single character.
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]+$/     # Match, due to the quantifier.

 -------
</pre>
<p>* There is an exception to a bracketed character class matching a
single character only.  When the class is to match caselessly under <code>/i</code>
matching rules, and a character inside the class matches a
multiple-character sequence caselessly under Unicode rules, the class
(when not <a href="#NAME-character-class-Negation">inverted</a>) will also match that sequence.  For
example, Unicode says that the letter <code>LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S</code>
should match the sequence <code>ss</code> under <code>/i</code> rules.  Thus,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> 'ss' =~ /\A\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}\z/i             # Matches
 'ss' =~ /\A[aeioust\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i    # Matches

<a name="Special-Characters-Inside-a-Bracketed-Character-Class"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.3.1 Special Characters Inside a Bracketed Character Class</h4>

<p>Most characters that are meta characters in regular expressions (that
is, characters that carry a special meaning like <code>.</code>, <code>*</code>, or <code>(</code>) lose
their special meaning and can be used inside a character class without
the need to escape them. For instance, <code>[()]</code> matches either an opening
parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, and the parens inside the character
class don&rsquo;t group or capture.
</p>
<p>Characters that may carry a special meaning inside a character class are:
<code>\</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, and are discussed below. They can be
escaped with a backslash, although this is sometimes not needed, in which
case the backslash may be omitted.
</p>
<p>The sequence <code>\b</code> is special inside a bracketed character class. While
outside the character class, <code>\b</code> is an assertion indicating a point
that does not have either two word characters or two non-word characters
on either side, inside a bracketed character class, <code>\b</code> matches a
backspace character.
</p>
<p>The sequences
<code>\a</code>,
<code>\c</code>,
<code>\e</code>,
<code>\f</code>,
<code>\n</code>,
<code>\N{<em>NAME</em>}</code>,
<code>\N{U+<em>hex char</em>}</code>,
<code>\r</code>,
<code>\t</code>,
and
<code>\x</code>
are also special and have the same meanings as they do outside a
bracketed character class.  (However, inside a bracketed character
class, if <code>\N{<em>NAME</em>}</code> expands to a sequence of characters, only the first
one in the sequence is used, with a warning.)
</p>
<p>Also, a backslash followed by two or three octal digits is considered an octal
number.
</p>
<p>A <code>[</code> is not special inside a character class, unless it&rsquo;s the start of a
POSIX character class (see <a href="#NAME-character-class-POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes</a> below). It normally does
not need escaping.
</p>
<p>A <code>]</code> is normally either the end of a POSIX character class (see
<a href="#NAME-character-class-POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes</a> below), or it signals the end of the bracketed
character class.  If you want to include a <code>]</code> in the set of characters, you
must generally escape it.
</p>
<p>However, if the <code>]</code> is the <em>first</em> (or the second if the first
character is a caret) character of a bracketed character class, it
does not denote the end of the class (as you cannot have an empty class)
and is considered part of the set of characters that can be matched without
escaping.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> &quot;+&quot;   =~ /[+?*]/     #  Match, &quot;+&quot; in a character class is not special.
 &quot;\cH&quot; =~ /[\b]/      #  Match, \b inside in a character class
                      #  is equivalent to a backspace.
 &quot;]&quot;   =~ /[][]/      #  Match, as the character class contains.
                      #  both [ and ].
 &quot;[]&quot;  =~ /[[]]/      #  Match, the pattern contains a character class
                      #  containing just ], and the character class is
                      #  followed by a ].

</div>
<a name="Character-Ranges"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.3.2 Character Ranges</h4>

<p>It is not uncommon to want to match a range of characters. Luckily, instead
of listing all characters in the range, one may use the hyphen (<code>-</code>).
If inside a bracketed character class you have two characters separated
by a hyphen, it&rsquo;s treated as if all characters between the two were in
the class. For instance, <code>[0-9]</code> matches any ASCII digit, and <code>[a-m]</code>
matches any lowercase letter from the first half of the ASCII alphabet.
</p>
<p>Note that the two characters on either side of the hyphen are not
necessarily both letters or both digits. Any character is possible,
although not advisable.  <code>['-?]</code> contains a range of characters, but
most people will not know which characters that means.  Furthermore,
such ranges may lead to portability problems if the code has to run on
a platform that uses a different character set, such as EBCDIC.
</p>
<p>If a hyphen in a character class cannot syntactically be part of a range, for
instance because it is the first or the last character of the character class,
or if it immediately follows a range, the hyphen isn&rsquo;t special, and so is
considered a character to be matched literally.  If you want a hyphen in
your set of characters to be matched and its position in the class is such
that it could be considered part of a range, you must escape that hyphen
with a backslash.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> [a-z]       #  Matches a character that is a lower case ASCII letter.
 [a-fz]      #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive) or
             #  the letter 'z'.
 [-z]        #  Matches either a hyphen ('-') or the letter 'z'.
 [a-f-m]     #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive), the
             #  hyphen ('-'), or the letter 'm'.
 ['-?]       #  Matches any of the characters  '()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?
             #  (But not on an EBCDIC platform).

</div>
<a name="Negation"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.3.3 Negation</h4>

<p>It is also possible to instead list the characters you do not want to
match. You can do so by using a caret (<code>^</code>) as the first character in the
character class. For instance, <code>[^a-z]</code> matches any character that is not a
lowercase ASCII letter, which therefore includes more than a million
Unicode code points.  The class is said to be &quot;negated&quot; or &quot;inverted&quot;.
</p>
<p>This syntax make the caret a special character inside a bracketed character
class, but only if it is the first character of the class. So if you want
the caret as one of the characters to match, either escape the caret or
else don&rsquo;t list it first.
</p>
<p>In inverted bracketed character classes, Perl ignores the Unicode rules
that normally say that certain characters should match a sequence of
multiple characters under caseless <code>/i</code> matching.  Following those
rules could lead to highly confusing situations:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> &quot;ss&quot; =~ /^[^\xDF]+$/ui;   # Matches!
</pre>
<p>This should match any sequences of characters that aren&rsquo;t <code>\xDF</code> nor
what <code>\xDF</code> matches under <code>/i</code>.  <code>&quot;s&quot;</code> isn&rsquo;t <code>\xDF</code>, but Unicode
says that <code>&quot;ss&quot;</code> is what <code>\xDF</code> matches under <code>/i</code>.  So which one
&quot;wins&quot;? Do you fail the match because the string has <code>ss</code> or accept it
because it has an <code>s</code> followed by another <code>s</code>?  Perl has chosen the
latter.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  No match, the 'e' is listed.
 &quot;x&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  Match, as 'x' isn't a lowercase vowel.
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[^^]/       #  No match, matches anything that isn't a caret.
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[x^]/       #  Match, caret is not special here.

<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.3.4 Backslash Sequences</h4>

<p>You can put any backslash sequence character class (with the exception of
<code>\N</code> and <code>\R</code>) inside a bracketed character class, and it will act just
as if you had put all characters matched by the backslash sequence inside the
character class. For instance, <code>[a-f\d]</code> matches any decimal digit, or any
of the lowercase letters between &rsquo;a&rsquo; and &rsquo;f&rsquo; inclusive.
</p>
<p><code>\N</code> within a bracketed character class must be of the forms <code>\N{<em>name</em>}</code>
or <code>\N{U+<em>hex char</em>}</code>, and NOT be the form that matches non-newlines,
for the same reason that a dot <code>.</code> inside a bracketed character class loses
its special meaning: it matches nearly anything, which generally isn&rsquo;t what you
want to happen.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> /[\p{Thai}\d]/     # Matches a character that is either a Thai
                    # character, or a digit.
 /[^\p{Arabic}()]/  # Matches a character that is neither an Arabic
                    # character, nor a parenthesis.

<p>POSIX character classes have the form <code>[:class:]</code>, where <em>class</em> is
name, and the <code>[:</code> and <code>:]</code> delimiters. POSIX character classes only appear
<em>inside</em> bracketed character classes, and are a convenient and descriptive
way of listing a group of characters.
</p>
<p>Be careful about the syntax,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> # Correct:
 $string =~ /[[:alpha:]]/

 # Incorrect (will warn):
 $string =~ /[:alpha:]/
</pre>
<p>The latter pattern would be a character class consisting of a colon,
and the letters <code>a</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>p</code> and <code>h</code>.
POSIX character classes can be part of a larger bracketed character class.
For example,
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> [01[:alpha:]%]
</pre>
<p>is valid and matches &rsquo;0&rsquo;, &rsquo;1&rsquo;, any alphabetic character, and the percent sign.
</p>
<p>Perl recognizes the following POSIX character classes:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim"> alpha  Any alphabetical character (&quot;[A-Za-z]&quot;).
 alnum  Any alphanumeric character. (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9]&quot;)
 ascii  Any character in the ASCII character set.
 blank  A GNU extension, equal to a space or a horizontal tab (&quot;\t&quot;).
 cntrl  Any control character.  See Note [2] below.
 digit  Any decimal digit (&quot;[0-9]&quot;), equivalent to &quot;\d&quot;.
 graph  Any printable character, excluding a space.  See Note [3] below.
 lower  Any lowercase character (&quot;[a-z]&quot;).
 print  Any printable character, including a space.  See Note [4] below.
 punct  Any graphical character excluding &quot;word&quot; characters.  Note [5].
 space  Any whitespace character. &quot;\s&quot; plus the vertical tab (&quot;\cK&quot;).
 upper  Any uppercase character (&quot;[A-Z]&quot;).
 word   A Perl extension (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]&quot;), equivalent to &quot;\w&quot;.
 xdigit Any hexadecimal digit (&quot;[0-9a-fA-F]&quot;).
</pre>
<p>Most POSIX character classes have two Unicode-style <code>\p</code> property
counterparts.  (They are not official Unicode properties, but Perl extensions
derived from official Unicode properties.)  The table below shows the relation
between POSIX character classes and these counterparts.
</p>
<p>One counterpart, in the column labelled &quot;ASCII-range Unicode&quot; in
the table, matches only characters in the ASCII character set.
</p>
<p>The other counterpart, in the column labelled &quot;Full-range Unicode&quot;, matches any
appropriate characters in the full Unicode character set.  For example,
<code>\p{Alpha}</code> matches not just the ASCII alphabetic characters, but any
character in the entire Unicode character set considered alphabetic.
An entry in the column labelled &quot;backslash sequence&quot; is a (short)
equivalent.

<p>Control characters don&rsquo;t produce output as such, but instead usually control
the terminal somehow: for example, newline and backspace are control characters.
In the ASCII range, characters whose code points are between 0 and 31 inclusive,
plus 127 (<code>DEL</code>) are control characters.
</p>
<p>On EBCDIC platforms, it is likely that the code page will define <code>[[:cntrl:]]</code>
to be the EBCDIC equivalents of the ASCII controls, plus the controls
that in Unicode have code pointss from 128 through 159.

<p><code>\p{PosixPunct}</code> and <code>[[:punct:]]</code> in the ASCII range match all
non-controls, non-alphanumeric, non-space characters:
<code>[-!&quot;#$%&amp;'()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\\]^_`{|}~]</code> (although if a locale is in effect,
it could alter the behavior of <code>[[:punct:]]</code>).
</p>
<p>The similarly named property, <code>\p{Punct}</code>, matches a somewhat different
set in the ASCII range, namely
<code>[-!&quot;#%&amp;'()*,./:;?@[\\\]_{}]</code>.  That is, it is missing the nine
characters <code>[$+&lt;=&gt;^`|~]</code>.
This is because Unicode splits what POSIX considers to be punctuation into two
categories, Punctuation and Symbols.
</p>
<p><code>\p{XPosixPunct}</code> and (under Unicode rules) <code>[[:punct:]]</code>, match what
<code>\p{PosixPunct}</code> matches in the ASCII range, plus what <code>\p{Punct}</code>
matches.  This is different than strictly matching according to
<code>\p{Punct}</code>.  Another way to say it is that
if Unicode rules are in effect, <code>[[:punct:]]</code> matches all characters
that Unicode considers punctuation, plus all ASCII-range characters that
Unicode considers symbols.

<p><code>\p{SpacePerl}</code> and <code>\p{Space}</code> differ only in that in non-locale
matching, <code>\p{Space}</code> additionally
matches the vertical tab, <code>\cK</code>.   Same for the two ASCII-only range forms.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are various other synonyms that can be used besides the names
listed in the table.  For example, <code>\p{PosixAlpha}</code> can be written as
<code>\p{Alpha}</code>.  All are listed in
<a href="../perluniprops/Properties-accessible-through-_005cp_007b_007d-and-_005cP_007b_007d.html#Properties-accessible-through-_005cp_007b_007d-and-_005cP_007b_007d">(perluniprops)Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}</a>,
plus all characters matched by each ASCII-range property.
</p>
<p>Both the <code>\p</code> counterparts always assume Unicode rules are in effect.
On ASCII platforms, this means they assume that the code points from 128
to 255 are Latin-1, and that means that using them under locale rules is
unwise unless the locale is guaranteed to be Latin-1 or UTF-8.  In contrast, the
POSIX character classes are useful under locale rules.  They are
affected by the actual rules in effect, as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>If the <code>/a</code> modifier, is in effect ...</dt>
<dd><a name="NAME-character-class-If-the-_002fa-modifier_002c-is-in-effect-_002e_002e_002e"></a>

<dd><a name="NAME-character-class-For-code-points-below-256-_002e_002e_002e-2"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>if locale rules are in effect ...</dt>
<dd><a name="NAME-character-class-if-locale-rules-are-in-effect-_002e_002e_002e-2"></a>
<p>The POSIX class matches according to the locale, except that
<code>word</code> uses the platform&rsquo;s native underscore character, no matter what
the locale is.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>if Unicode rules are in effect or if on an EBCDIC platform ...</dt>
<dd><a name="NAME-character-class-if-Unicode-rules-are-in-effect-or-if-on-an-EBCDIC-platform-_002e_002e_002e-2"></a>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>otherwise ...</dt>
<dd><a name="NAME-character-class-otherwise-_002e_002e_002e-5"></a>
<p>The POSIX class matches the same as the ASCII range counterpart.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Which rules apply are determined as described in
<a href="../perlre/Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect_003f.html#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect_003f">(perlre)Which character set modifier is in effect?</a>.
</p>
<p>It is proposed to change this behavior in a future release of Perl so that
whether or not Unicode rules are in effect would not change the
behavior:  Outside of locale or an EBCDIC code page, the POSIX classes
would behave like their ASCII-range counterparts.  If you wish to
comment on this proposal, send email to <code>perl5-porters@perl.org</code>.

<h4 class="subsubsection">61.2.3.6 Negation of POSIX character classes</h4>
<a name="index-character-class_002c-negation"></a>

<p>A Perl extension to the POSIX character class is the ability to
negate it. This is done by prefixing the class name with a caret (<code>^</code>).
Some examples:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">     POSIX         ASCII-range     Full-range  backslash
                    Unicode         Unicode    sequence

 [[:^digit:]]   \P{PosixDigit}  \P{XPosixDigit}   \D
 [[:^space:]]   \P{PosixSpace}  \P{XPosixSpace}
                \P{PerlSpace}   \P{XPerlSpace}    \S
 [[:^word:]]    \P{PerlWord}    \P{XPosixWord}    \W
</pre>
<p>The backslash sequence can mean either ASCII- or Full-range Unicode,
depending on various factors as described in <a href="../perlre/Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect_003f.html#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect_003f">(perlre)Which character set modifier is in effect?</a>.
