<h2>Perl</h2>

<p>For clarity: Perl is free software, but it is not a GNU package.
However, the GNU web site has long had this page about it, so it will
remain for reference.  

<p>For more information and to download the software, please see the <a
href="http://www.perl.org">perl.org home page</a>.

<p>We do make use of this directory on www.gnu.org to make available a <a
href="manual/">Texinfo translation of the Perl documentation</a> for the
latest stable Perl release.
