<h2>Recode</h2>

<p>For clarity: recode is free software, but it is not a GNU package.
However, the GNU web site has long had this page about it, so it will
remain for reference.  

<p>For more information and to download the software, please see the <a
href="http://recode.progiciels-bpi.ca/">recode home page</a>.
