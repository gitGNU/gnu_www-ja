<p>The gnuprologjava package by Constantine Plotnikov is an
implementation of ISO Prolog as a Java library (gnu.prolog).  We are
looking for a new maintainer (Constantine is willing to answer questions
and provide suggestions, but has no time to support it).

<p>The first thing to do is ensure that the package works with GNU
Classpath and/or the now-freed parts of <a
href="http://openjdk.java.net/">openjdk</a>, not just the proprietary
JDK release from Sun.

Other ideas from Constantine:
<ul>
<li>It should really compile to JVM bytecodes to fasten things up and
the compiled code should be more optimal with respect to unification
and head matching.
<li>It should support part 2 of the ISO standard (modules).
<li>More documentation is required.
<li>The parser should be redesigned.
</ul>

<p>If you're interested, please take a look at this <a
href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general information about GNU
packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then email
maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and interest.  Thanks!
