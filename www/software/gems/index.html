<P> This is a web page about GEMS, which is a 3D Modeling System for
mechanical purposes, such as structures analysis and product design.
GEMS can also be used as a common 3D modeler.

<P> With its extensible architecture, the application domain should
not be limited only to mechanical purposes, and we hope to provide
with time a full featured engineering analysis framework.

<h5><a href="#TOCmeaning" NAME="meaning">What does GEMS stands for?</a> </h5>

GEMS means <em>GNU Extensible Modeling System</em>.  This both an
acronym and a word which we hope that represents, a stone as a core
material, but also a material that has been crafted with care.

<P> GEMS is nowadays in its early stage of design and two core
components are being written.  Right now, foundations have been build
and it is possible to compute simple operations with Haplo or to
display 3D objects with CoreGeometry.  The link between those two
components will be made as soon as the API's design is completely done.

<h5><a href="#TOCreason" NAME="reason">Why another modeler?</a> </h5>

Actually GEMS is not a <em>modeler</EM>, it is a modeling
<em>and</EM> analysis system.  The main difference is that not only
you modelize 3D models, but you also study its behavior towards
mechanicals forces.  The 3D model needs to be represented with
geometrical parameters (distance, parallelism, orthogonality). This is
why we would like to emphasize the need of a different approach of the
user interface.

<p> Programs like Moonlight Creator or Minds Eyes are destined to
graphical applications whereas GEMS is destined to engineering
applications. Thus we do not build "yet-another-modeler" and
hopefully do not pretend to compete with them.

<p> Please, don't be afraid!  This does not mean that we do not love nifty 3D
graphics and nice user interfaces.  We effectively realize that most
of engineering applications do not provide a functional and nice user
interface (however there are exceptions).



<H4><A HREF="#TOCcomponents" NAME="components">Framework components</A></H4>

GEMS is composed of two major components:

<h5><a href="#TOChaplo" NAME="haplo">Haplo</a> </h5>

<P> Haplo is basically a parser/interpreter with object oriented
approach.  This main component makes the interface between the user
and the GEMS framework and provides calculus features needed for the
analysis part of GEMS.

<P> Haplo is a text driven program but has also a graphical
equivalent, named xhaplo which uses the CoreGeometry and the <a
href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</a> toolkit.

<P> Haplo is maintained by Nicolas Laurent <A
HREF="mailto:nl@gnu.org"> &lt;nl@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

<P> You can find more informations about Haplo at <a
href="haplo/index.html">this page</a>.
       
<h5><a href="#TOCcoregeom" NAME="coregeom">CoreGeometry
library</a></h5>

<P> This library implements a 3D display system based on <a
href="http://www.mesagl.org">MesaGL</a> (a free implementation of <a
href="http://www.sgi.com">SGI's OpenGL</a>).  This 3D system is not
like others because it specifically deals with geometrical operations
like <b>extrusion, revolution, free path convolution and boolean
operations</b> between primitive objects.

<P> The goal of CoreGeometry is to give the user an easy way to build
elaborated 3D objects.

<p> You can find more informations about CoreGeometry at <a
href="CG/index.html">this page</a>.

<H4><A HREF="#TOCdownloading" NAME="downloading">Downloading GEMS</A></H4>

You can download a early version of CoreGeometry and Haplo.  A
distribution of GEMS (the combination of the two) will be provided
soon.

<P> Please realize that this work is at its beginning, so don't blame
us too much :-) However, you are welcome to send us comments so we can
improve GEMS.

<P> GEMS can be found on <A HREF="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/foo/">
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/GEMS/</A> or one of <A HREF="/prep/ftp.html">the
mirrors</A>.  <P>
