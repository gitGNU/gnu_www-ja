<STRONG>What is <CODE>libxmi</CODE>?</STRONG>
<P>
GNU <CODE>libxmi</CODE> is a C/C++ function library for rasterizing 2-D
vector graphics.  It can draw 2-D graphical primitives, including wide
polygonal lines and circular and elliptical arcs, into a user-supplied
matrix of pixels.  Sophisticated line styles, such as multicolored dashing
patterns, can be specified.  There is also support for filling and
texturing polygons.

<P> The current version of the <CODE>libxmi</CODE> package is
version&nbsp;1.2, released in June 2000.  It&nbsp;can be installed on
GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Unix systems.  Since <CODE>libxmi</CODE> is written
in ANSI&nbsp;C, it&nbsp;should be easy to compile and install on almost any
system with a C&nbsp;compiler.

<P> The <CODE>libxmi</CODE> package is free software.  Here is <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">information on obtaining the
source code</A>.

<P>
<STRONG>What is <CODE>libxmi</CODE> good for?</STRONG>
<P>
It can be used as a drop-in rendering module in any application that needs
to scan-convert 2-D vector graphics.  It&nbsp;is highly customizable.  For
example, the `pixel' datatype can be redefined at compile time.  The
algorithm used for compositing pixels can be redefined too.
By&nbsp;default, <CODE>libxmi</CODE> uses the Painter's Algorithm
(a&nbsp;new pixel value replaces an old&nbsp;one).  But it would be trivial
to install it so that it uses alpha compositing instead.  The package, and
its header file <CODE>xmi.h</CODE>, include full documentation.

<P>
<STRONG>Who wrote <CODE>libxmi</CODE>?</STRONG> 
<P>
<CODE>libxmi</CODE> is based on the scan-conversion code in the X11 sample
server, which was written in the late 1980s by programmers associated with
the <A HREF="http://www.x.org">X&nbsp;Consortium</A>.  Even though it
maintains pixel-level compatibility with X11 drawing functions,
it&nbsp;has been
decoupled from the X&nbsp;Window System: it no&nbsp;longer requires an
X&nbsp;display.

In 1999, <A HREF="http://www.math.arizona.edu/~rsm">Robert Maier</A> extracted
the scan-conversion code, converted it to ANSI&nbsp;C, and modified it to
use a two-stage graphics pipeline (the second stage being the stage when
pixel-merging takes place).  The resulting code was incorporated as a
rendering module in the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html">GNU plotting
utilities package</A>, of&nbsp;which he is the maintainer.  The rendering
module is now being distributed separately, under the name
<CODE>libxmi</CODE>.
