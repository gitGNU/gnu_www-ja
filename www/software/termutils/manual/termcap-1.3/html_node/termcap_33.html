<EM>Appearance modes</EM> are modifications to the ways characters are
displayed.  Typical appearance modes include reverse video, dim, bright,
blinking, underlined, invisible, and alternate character set.  Each kind of
terminal supports various among these, or perhaps none.

</P>
<P>
For each type of terminal, one appearance mode or combination of them that
looks good for highlighted text is chosen as the <EM>standout mode</EM>.  The
capabilities <SAMP>`so'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`se'</SAMP> say how to enter and leave standout
mode.  Programs that use appearance modes only to highlight some text
generally use the standout mode so that they can work on as many terminals
as possible.  Use of specific appearance modes other than "underlined"
and "alternate character set" is rare.

</P>
<P>
Terminals that implement appearance modes fall into two general classes as
to how they do it.

</P>
<P>
In some terminals, the presence or absence of any appearance mode is
recorded separately for each character position.  In these terminals, each
graphic character written is given the appearance modes current at the time
it is written, and keeps those modes until it is erased or overwritten.
There are special commands to turn the appearance modes on or off for
characters to be written in the future.

</P>
<P>
In other terminals, the change of appearance modes is represented by a
marker that belongs to a certain screen position but affects all following
screen positions until the next marker.  These markers are traditionally
called <EM>magic cookies</EM>.

</P>
<P>
The same capabilities (<SAMP>`so'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`se'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`mb'</SAMP> and so on) for
turning appearance modes on and off are used for both magic-cookie
terminals and per-character terminals.  On magic cookie terminals, these
give the commands to write the magic cookies.  On per-character terminals,
they change the current modes that affect future output and erasure.  Some
simple applications can use these commands without knowing whether or not
they work by means of cookies.

</P>
<P>
However, a program that maintains and updates a display needs to know
whether the terminal uses magic cookies, and exactly what their effect is.
This information comes from the <SAMP>`sg'</SAMP> capability.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`sg'</SAMP> capability is a numeric capability whose presence indicates
that the terminal uses magic cookies for appearance modes.  Its value is
the number of character positions that a magic cookie occupies.  Usually
the cookie occupies one or more character positions on the screen, and these
character positions are displayed as blank, but in some terminals the
cookie has zero width.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`sg'</SAMP> capability describes both the magic cookie to turn standout
on and the cookie to turn it off.  This makes the assumption that both
kinds of cookie have the same width on the screen.  If that is not true,
the narrower cookie must be "widened" with spaces until it has the same
width as the other.

</P>
<P>
On some magic cookie terminals, each line always starts with normal
display; in other words, the scope of a magic cookie never extends over
more than one line.  But on other terminals, one magic cookie affects all
the lines below it unless explicitly canceled.  Termcap does not define any
way to distinguish these two ways magic cookies can work.  To be safe, it
is best to put a cookie at the beginning of each line.

</P>
<P>
On some per-character terminals, standout mode or other appearance modes
may be canceled by moving the cursor.  On others, moving the cursor has no
effect on the state of the appearance modes.  The latter class of terminals
are given the flag capability <SAMP>`ms'</SAMP> ("can move in standout").  All
programs that might have occasion to move the cursor while appearance modes
are turned on must check for this flag; if it is not present, they should
reset appearance modes to normal before doing cursor motion.

</P>
<P>
A program that has turned on only standout mode should use <SAMP>`se'</SAMP> to
reset the standout mode to normal.  A program that has turned on only
alternate character set mode should use <SAMP>`ae'</SAMP> to return it to normal.
If it is possible that any other appearance modes are turned on, use the
<SAMP>`me'</SAMP> capability to return them to normal.

</P>
<P>
Note that the commands to turn on one appearance mode, including <SAMP>`so'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`mb'</SAMP> ... <SAMP>`mr'</SAMP>, if used while some other appearance modes
are turned on, may combine the two modes on some terminals but may turn off
the mode previously enabled on other terminals.  This is because some
terminals do not have a command to set or clear one appearance mode without
changing the others.  Programs should not attempt to use appearance modes
in combination except with <SAMP>`sa'</SAMP>, and when switching from one single
mode to another should always turn off the previously enabled mode and then
turn on the new desired mode.

</P>
<P>
On some old terminals, the <SAMP>`so'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`se'</SAMP> commands may be the same
command, which has the effect of turning standout on if it is off, or off
it is on.  It is therefore risky for a program to output extra <SAMP>`se'</SAMP>
commands for good measure.  Fortunately, all these terminals are obsolete.

</P>
<P>
Programs that update displays in which standout-text may be replaced with
non-standout text must check for the <SAMP>`xs'</SAMP> flag.  In a per-character
terminal, this flag says that the only way to remove standout once written is
to clear that portion of the line with the <SAMP>`ce'</SAMP> string or something
even more powerful (see section <A HREF="termcap_30.html#SEC30">Clearing Parts of the Screen</A>); just writing new characters at those
screen positions will not change the modes in effect there.  In a magic
cookie terminal, <SAMP>`xs'</SAMP> says that the only way to remove a cookie is to
clear a portion of the line that includes the cookie; writing a different
cookie at the same position does not work.

</P>
<P>
Such programs must also check for the <SAMP>`xt'</SAMP> flag, which means that the
terminal is a Teleray 1061.  On this terminal it is impossible to position
the cursor at the front of a magic cookie, so the only two ways to remove a
cookie are (1) to delete the line it is on or (2) to position the cursor at
least one character before it (possibly on a previous line) and output the
<SAMP>`se'</SAMP> string, which on these terminals finds and removes the next
<SAMP>`so'</SAMP> magic cookie on the screen.  (It may also be possible to remove a
cookie which is not at the beginning of a line by clearing that line.)  The
<SAMP>`xt'</SAMP> capability also has implications for the use of tab characters,
but in that regard it is obsolete (See section <A HREF="termcap_26.html#SEC26">Cursor Motion</A>).

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`so'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
String of commands to enter standout mode.

<DT><SAMP>`se'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
String of commands to leave standout mode.

<DT><SAMP>`sg'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
Numeric capability, the width on the screen of the magic cookie.  This
capability is absent in terminals that record appearance modes
character by character.

<DT><SAMP>`ms'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
Flag whose presence means that it is safe to move the cursor while the
appearance modes are not in the normal state.  If this flag is absent,
programs should always reset the appearance modes to normal before
moving the cursor.

<DT><SAMP>`xs'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
Flag whose presence means that the only way to reset appearance modes
already on the screen is to clear to end of line.  On a per-character
terminal, you must clear the area where the modes are set.  On a magic
cookie terminal, you must clear an area containing the cookie.
See the discussion above.

<DT><SAMP>`xt'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
Flag whose presence means that the cursor cannot be positioned right
in front of a magic cookie, and that <SAMP>`se'</SAMP> is a command to delete
the next magic cookie following the cursor.  See discussion above.

<DT><SAMP>`mb'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
String of commands to enter blinking mode.

<DT><SAMP>`md'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
String of commands to enter double-bright mode.

<DT><SAMP>`mh'</SAMP>

<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
String of commands to enter half-bright mode.

<DT><SAMP>`mk'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
String of commands to enter invisible mode.

<DT><SAMP>`mp'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
String of commands to enter protected mode.

<DT><SAMP>`mr'</SAMP>

String of commands to enter reverse-video mode.

<DT><SAMP>`me'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
String of commands to turn off all appearance modes, including
standout mode and underline mode.  On some terminals it also turns off
alternate character set mode; on others, it may not.  This capability
must be present if any of <SAMP>`mb'</SAMP> ... <SAMP>`mr'</SAMP> is present.

<DT><SAMP>`as'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
String of commands to turn on alternate character set mode.  This mode
assigns some or all graphic characters an alternate picture on the
screen.  There is no standard as to what the alternate pictures look
like.

<DT><SAMP>`ae'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
String of commands to turn off alternate character set mode.

<DT><SAMP>`sa'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
String of commands to turn on an arbitrary combination of appearance
modes.  It accepts 9 parameters, each of which controls a particular
kind of appearance mode.  A parameter should be 1 to turn its appearance
mode on, or zero to turn that mode off.  Most terminals do not support
the <SAMP>`sa'</SAMP> capability, even among those that do have various
appearance modes.

The nine parameters are, in order, <VAR>standout</VAR>, <VAR>underline</VAR>,
<VAR>reverse</VAR>, <VAR>blink</VAR>, <VAR>half-bright</VAR>, <VAR>double-bright</VAR>,
<VAR>blank</VAR>, <VAR>protect</VAR>, <VAR>alt char set</VAR>.
