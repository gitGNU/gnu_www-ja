<H1><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC23">Definitions of the Terminal Capabilities</A></H1>

<P>
This section is divided into many subsections, each for one aspect of
use of display terminals.  For writing a display program, you usually need
only check the subsections for the operations you want to use.  For writing
a terminal description, you must read each subsection and fill in the
capabilities described there.

</P>
<P>
String capabilities that are display commands may require numeric
parameters (see section <A HREF="termcap_12.html#SEC12">Filling In Parameters</A>).  Most such capabilities do not use
parameters.  When a capability requires parameters, this is explicitly
stated at the beginning of its definition.  In simple cases, the first or
second sentence of the definition mentions all the parameters, in the order
they should be given, using a name
in italics
for each one.  For example, the <SAMP>`rp'</SAMP> capability is a command that
requires two parameters; its definition begins as follows:

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
String of commands to output a graphic character <VAR>c</VAR>, repeated <VAR>n</VAR>
times.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In complex cases or when there are many parameters, they are described
explicitly.

</P>
<P>
When a capability is described as obsolete, this means that programs should
not be written to look for it, but terminal descriptions should still be
written to provide it.

</P>
<P>
When a capability is described as very obsolete, this means that it should
be omitted from terminal descriptions as well.
