There are several terminal capabilities for clearing parts of the screen
to blank.  All display terminals support the <SAMP>`cl'</SAMP> string, and most
display terminals support all of these capabilities.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`cl'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
String of commands to clear the entire screen and position the cursor
at the upper left corner.

<DT><SAMP>`cd'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
String of commands to clear the line the cursor is on, and all the
lines below it, down to the bottom of the screen.  This command string
should be used only with the cursor in column zero; their effect is
undefined if the cursor is elsewhere.

<DT><SAMP>`ce'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
String of commands to clear from the cursor to the end of the current
line.

<DT><SAMP>`ec'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
String of commands to clear <VAR>n</VAR> characters, starting with the
character that the cursor is on.  This command string is expected to
leave the cursor position unchanged.  The parameter <VAR>n</VAR> should never
be large enough to reach past the right margin; the effect of such a
large parameter would be undefined.
</DL>

<P>
Clear to end of line (<SAMP>`ce'</SAMP>) is extremely important in programs that
maintain an updating display.  Nearly all display terminals support this
operation, so it is acceptable for a an application program to refuse to
work if <SAMP>`ce'</SAMP> is not present.  However, if you do not want this
limitation, you can accomplish clearing to end of line by outputting spaces
until you reach the right margin.  In order to do this, you must know the
current horizontal position.  Also, this technique assumes that writing a
space will erase.  But this happens to be true on all the display terminals
that fail to support <SAMP>`ce'</SAMP>.
