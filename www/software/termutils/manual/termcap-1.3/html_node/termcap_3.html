<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC3">Preparing to Use the Termcap Library</A></H2>

<P>
To use the termcap library in a program, you need two kinds of preparation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The compiler needs declarations of the functions and variables in the
library.

On GNU systems, it suffices to include the header file
<TT>`termcap.h'</TT> in each source file that uses these functions and
variables.
On Unix systems, there is often no such header file.  Then you must
explictly declare the variables as external.  You can do likewise for
the functions, or let them be implicitly declared and cast their
values from type <CODE>int</CODE> to the appropriate type.

We illustrate the declarations of the individual termcap library
functions with ANSI C prototypes because they show how to pass the
arguments.  If you are not using the GNU C compiler, you probably
cannot use function prototypes, so omit the argument types and names
from your declarations.

<LI>

The linker needs to search the library.  Usually either
<SAMP>`-ltermcap'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-ltermlib'</SAMP> as an argument when linking will
do this.</UL>
