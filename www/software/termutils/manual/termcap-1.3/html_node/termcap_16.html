<H4><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC16"><CODE>tgoto</CODE></A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
The special case of cursor motion is handled by <CODE>tgoto</CODE>.  There
are two reasons why you might choose to use <CODE>tgoto</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For Unix compatibility, because Unix termcap does not have <CODE>tparam</CODE>.

<LI>

For the <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP> capability, since <CODE>tgoto</CODE> has a special feature
to avoid problems with null characters, tabs and newlines on certain old
terminal types that use <SAMP>`%.'</SAMP> encoding for that capability.
</UL>

<P>
Here is how <CODE>tgoto</CODE> might be declared in ANSI C:

</P>

<PRE>
char *tgoto (char *<VAR>cstring</VAR>, int <VAR>hpos</VAR>, int <VAR>vpos</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
There are three arguments, the terminal description's <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP> string and
the two cursor position numbers; <CODE>tgoto</CODE> computes the parametrized
string in an internal static buffer and returns the address of that buffer.
The next time you use <CODE>tgoto</CODE> the same buffer will be reused.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
Parameters encoded with <SAMP>`%.'</SAMP> encoding can generate null characters,
tabs or newlines.  These might cause trouble: the null character because
<CODE>tputs</CODE> would think that was the end of the string, the tab because
the kernel or other software might expand it into spaces, and the newline
becaue the kernel might add a carriage-return, or padding characters
normally used for a newline.  To prevent such problems, <CODE>tgoto</CODE> is
careful to avoid these characters.  Here is how this works: if the target
cursor position value is such as to cause a problem (that is to say, zero,
nine or ten), <CODE>tgoto</CODE> increments it by one, then compensates by
appending a string to move the cursor back or up one position.

</P>
<P>
The compensation strings to use for moving back or up are found in global
variables named <CODE>BC</CODE> and <CODE>UP</CODE>.  These are actual external C
variables with upper case names; they are declared <CODE>char *</CODE>.  It is up
to you to store suitable values in them, normally obtained from the
<SAMP>`le'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`up'</SAMP> terminal capabilities in the terminal description
with <CODE>tgetstr</CODE>.  Alternatively, if these two variables are both zero,
the feature of avoiding nulls, tabs and newlines is turned off.

</P>
<P>
It is safe to use <CODE>tgoto</CODE> for commands other than <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP> only if
you have stored zero in <CODE>BC</CODE> and <CODE>UP</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>tgoto</CODE> reverses the order of its operands: the horizontal
position comes before the vertical position in the arguments to
<CODE>tgoto</CODE>, even though the vertical position comes before the horizontal
in the parameters of the <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP> string.  If you use <CODE>tgoto</CODE> with a
command such as <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> that takes one parameter, you must pass the
parameter to <CODE>tgoto</CODE> as the "vertical position".
