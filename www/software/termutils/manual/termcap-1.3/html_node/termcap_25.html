A terminal description has two capabilities, <SAMP>`co'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`li'</SAMP>,
that describe the screen size in columns and lines.  But there is more
to the question of screen size than this.

</P>
<P>
On some operating systems the "screen" is really a window and the
effective width can vary.  On some of these systems, <CODE>tgetnum</CODE>
uses the actual width of the window to decide what value to return for
the <SAMP>`co'</SAMP> capability, overriding what is actually written in the
terminal description.  On other systems, it is up to the application
program to check the actual window width using a system call.  For
example, on BSD 4.3 systems, the system call <CODE>ioctl</CODE> with code
<CODE>TIOCGWINSZ</CODE> will tell you the current screen size.

</P>
<P>
On all window systems, termcap is powerless to advise the application
program if the user resizes the window.  Application programs must
deal with this possibility in a system-dependent fashion.  On some
systems the C shell handles part of the problem by detecting changes
in window size and setting the <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> environment variable
appropriately.  This takes care of application programs that are
started subsequently.  It does not help application programs already
running.

</P>
<P>
On some systems, including BSD 4.3, all programs using a terminal get
a signal named <CODE>SIGWINCH</CODE> whenever the screen size changes.
Programs that use termcap should handle this signal by using
<CODE>ioctl TIOCGWINSZ</CODE> to learn the new screen size.

</P>
