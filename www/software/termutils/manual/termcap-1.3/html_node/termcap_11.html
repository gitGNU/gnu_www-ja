Use the termcap function <CODE>tputs</CODE> to output a string containing an
optional padding spec of the form described above (see section <A HREF="termcap_10.html#SEC10">Specifying Padding in a Terminal Description</A>).  The function <CODE>tputs</CODE> strips off and decodes the padding
spec, outputs the rest of the string, and then outputs the appropriate
padding.  Here is its declaration in ANSI C:

</P>

<PRE>
char PC;
short ospeed;

int tputs (char *<VAR>string</VAR>, int <VAR>nlines</VAR>, int (*<VAR>outfun</VAR>) ());
</PRE>

<P>
Here <VAR>string</VAR> is the string (including padding spec) to be output;
<VAR>nlines</VAR> is the number of lines affected by the operation, which is
used to multiply the amount of padding if the padding spec ends with a
<SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.  Finally, <VAR>outfun</VAR> is a function (such as <CODE>fputchar</CODE>)
that is called to output each character.  When actually called,
<VAR>outfun</VAR> should expect one argument, a character.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
The operation of <CODE>tputs</CODE> is controlled by two global variables,
<CODE>ospeed</CODE> and <CODE>PC</CODE>.  The value of <CODE>ospeed</CODE> is supposed to be
the terminal output speed, encoded as in the <CODE>ioctl</CODE> system call which
gets the speed information.  This is needed to compute the number of
padding characters.  The value of <CODE>PC</CODE> is the character used for
padding.

</P>
<P>
You are responsible for storing suitable values into these variables before
using <CODE>tputs</CODE>.  The value stored into the <CODE>PC</CODE> variable should be
taken from the <SAMP>`pc'</SAMP> capability in the terminal description (see section <A HREF="termcap_40.html#SEC40">Padding Capabilities</A>).  Store zero in <CODE>PC</CODE> if there is no <SAMP>`pc'</SAMP>
capability.
</P>
<P>
The argument <VAR>nlines</VAR> requires some thought.  Normally, it should be
the number of lines whose contents will be cleared or moved by the command.
For cursor motion commands, or commands that do editing within one line,
use the value 1.  For most commands that affect multiple lines, such as
<SAMP>`al'</SAMP> (insert a line) and <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP> (clear from the cursor to the end
of the screen), <VAR>nlines</VAR> should be the screen height minus the current
vertical position (origin 0).  For multiple insert and scroll commands such
as <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> (insert multiple lines), that same value for <VAR>nlines</VAR> is
correct; the number of lines being inserted is <I>not</I> correct.
</P>
<P>
If a "scroll window" feature is used to reduce the number of lines
affected by a command, the value of <VAR>nlines</VAR> should take this into
account.  This is because the delay time required depends on how much work
the terminal has to do, and the scroll window feature reduces the work.
See section <A HREF="termcap_28.html#SEC28">Scrolling</A>.

</P>
<P>
Commands such as <SAMP>`ic'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`dc'</SAMP> (insert or delete characters) are
problematical because the padding needed by these commands is proportional
to the number of characters affected, which is the number of columns from
the cursor to the end of the line.  It would be nice to have a way to
specify such a dependence, and there is no need for dependence on vertical
position in these commands, so it is an obvious idea to say that for these
commands <VAR>nlines</VAR> should really be the number of columns affected.
However, the definition of termcap clearly says that <VAR>nlines</VAR> is always
the number of lines affected, even in this case, where it is always 1.  It
is not easy to change this rule now, because too many programs and terminal
descriptions have been written to follow it.

</P>
<P>
Because <VAR>nlines</VAR> is always 1 for the <SAMP>`ic'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`dc'</SAMP> strings,
there is no reason for them to use <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, but some of them do.  These
should be corrected by deleting the <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.  If, some day, such entries
have disappeared, it may be possible to change to a more useful convention
for the <VAR>nlines</VAR> argument for these operations without breaking any
programs.
