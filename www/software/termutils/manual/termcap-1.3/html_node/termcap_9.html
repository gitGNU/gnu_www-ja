<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC9">When There Is Not Enough Padding</A></H3>

<P>
There are several common manifestations of insufficient padding.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Emacs displays <SAMP>`I-search: ^Q-'</SAMP> at the bottom of the screen.

This means that the terminal thought its buffer was getting full of
display commands, so it tried to tell the computer to stop sending
any.

<LI>

The screen is garbled intermittently, or the details of garbling vary
when you repeat the action.  (A garbled screen could be due to a
command which is simply incorrect, or to user option in the terminal
which doesn't match the assumptions of the terminal description, but
this usually leads to reproducible failure.)

This means that the buffer did get full, and some commands were lost.
Many changeable factors can change which ones are lost.

<LI>

Screen is garbled at high output speeds but not at low speeds.
Padding problems nearly always go away at low speeds, usually even at
1200 baud.

This means that a high enough speed permits commands to arrive faster
than they can be executed.
</UL>

<P>
Although any obscure command on an obscure terminal might lack padding,
in practice problems arise most often from the clearing commands
<SAMP>`cl'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="termcap_30.html#SEC30">Clearing Parts of the Screen</A>), the scrolling commands
<SAMP>`sf'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`sr'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="termcap_28.html#SEC28">Scrolling</A>), and the line insert/delete
commands <SAMP>`al'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="termcap_31.html#SEC31">Insert/Delete Line</A>).

</P>
<P>
Occasionally the terminal description fails to define <SAMP>`sf'</SAMP> and some
programs will use <SAMP>`do'</SAMP> instead, so you may get a problem with
<SAMP>`do'</SAMP>.  If so, first define <SAMP>`sf'</SAMP> just like <SAMP>`do'</SAMP>, then
add some padding to <SAMP>`sf'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The best strategy is to add a lot of padding at first, perhaps 200 msec.
This is much more than enough; in fact, it should cause a visible slowdown.
(If you don't see a slowdown, the change has not taken effect;
see section <A HREF="termcap_22.html#SEC22">When Changes in the Data Base Take Effect</A>.)  If this makes the problem go away, you have found the
right place to add padding; now reduce the amount until the problem comes
back, then increase it again.  If the problem remains, either it is in some
other capability or it is not a matter of padding at all.

</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that on many terminals the correct padding for insert/delete
line or for scrolling is cursor-position dependent.  If you get problems
from scrolling a large region of the screen but not from scrolling a small
part (just a few lines moving), it may mean that fixed padding should be
replaced with position-dependent padding.
