<EM>Inserting a line</EM> means creating a blank line in the middle
of the screen, and pushing the existing lines of text apart.  In fact,
the lines above the insertion point do not change, while the lines below
move down, and one is normally lost at the bottom of the screen.

</P>
<P>
<EM>Deleting a line</EM> means causing the line to disappear from the screen,
closing up the gap by moving the lines below it upward.  A new line
appears at the bottom of the screen.  Usually this line is blank, but
on terminals with the <SAMP>`db'</SAMP> flag it may be a line previously moved
off the screen bottom by scrolling or line insertion.

</P>
<P>
Insertion and deletion of lines is useful in programs that maintain an
updating display some parts of which may get longer or shorter.  They are
also useful in editors for scrolling parts of the screen, and for
redisplaying after lines of text are killed or inserted.

</P>
<P>
Many terminals provide commands to insert or delete a single line at the
cursor position.  Some provide the ability to insert or delete several
lines with one command, using the number of lines to insert or delete as a
parameter.  Always move the cursor to column zero before using any of
these commands.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`al'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
String of commands to insert a blank line before the line the cursor
is on.  The existing line, and all lines below it, are moved down.
The last line in the screen (or in the scroll region, if one is set)
disappears and in most circumstances is discarded.  It may not be
discarded if the <SAMP>`db'</SAMP> is present (see section <A HREF="termcap_28.html#SEC28">Scrolling</A>).

The cursor must be at the left margin before this command is used.
This command does not move the cursor.

<DT><SAMP>`dl'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
String of commands to delete the line the cursor is on.  The following
lines move up, and a blank line appears at the bottom of the screen
(or bottom of the scroll region).  If the terminal has the <SAMP>`db'</SAMP>
flag, a nonblank line previously pushed off the screen bottom may
reappear at the bottom.

The cursor must be at the left margin before this command is used.
This command does not move the cursor.

<DT><SAMP>`AL'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
String of commands to insert <VAR>n</VAR> blank lines before the line that
the cursor is on.  It is like <SAMP>`al'</SAMP> repeated <VAR>n</VAR> times, except
that it is as fast as one <SAMP>`al'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`DL'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
String of commands to delete <VAR>n</VAR> lines starting with the line that
the cursor is on.  It is like <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP> repeated <VAR>n</VAR> times, except
that it is as fast as one <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP>.
</DL>

<P>
Any terminal description that defines <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> should also define
<SAMP>`al'</SAMP>; likewise for <SAMP>`DL'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP>.  However, many terminals
can only insert or delete one line at a time, so it is common to find
<SAMP>`al'</SAMP> and not <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP> without <SAMP>`DL'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, all programs that use the insert and delete facilities should be
prepared to work with <SAMP>`al'</SAMP> in the case that <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> is absent, and
likewise with <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP>.  On the other hand, it is acceptable to write
an application that uses only <SAMP>`al'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`dl'</SAMP> and does not look
for <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`DL'</SAMP> at all.
</P>
<P>
If a terminal does not support line insertion and deletion directly,
but does support a scroll region, the effect of insertion and deletion
can be obtained with scrolling.  However, it is up to the individual
user program to check for this possibility and use the scrolling
commands to get the desired result.  It is fairly important to implement
this alternate strategy, since it is the only way to get the effect of
line insertion and deletion on the popular VT100 terminal.

</P>
<P>
Insertion and deletion of lines is affected by the scroll region on
terminals that have a settable scroll region.  This is useful when it is
desirable to move any few consecutive lines up or down by a few lines.
See section <A HREF="termcap_28.html#SEC28">Scrolling</A>.

</P>
<P>
The line pushed off the bottom of the screen is not lost if the terminal
has the <SAMP>`db'</SAMP> flag capability; instead, it is pushed into display
memory that does not appear on the screen.  This is the same thing that
happens when scrolling pushes a line off the bottom of the screen.
Either reverse scrolling or deletion of a line can bring the apparently
lost line back onto the bottom of the screen.  If the terminal has the
scroll region feature as well as <SAMP>`db'</SAMP>, the pushed-out line really
is lost if a scroll region is in effect.

</P>
<P>
When outputting an insert or delete command with <CODE>tputs</CODE>, the
<VAR>nlines</VAR> argument should be the total number of lines from the cursor
to the bottom of the screen (or scroll region).  Very often these commands
require padding proportional to this number of lines.  See section <A HREF="termcap_7.html#SEC7">Padding</A>.

</P>
<P>
For <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`DL'</SAMP> the <VAR>nlines</VAR> argument should <EM>not</EM>
depend on the number of lines inserted or deleted; only the total number of
lines affected.  This is because it is just as fast to insert two or
<VAR>n</VAR> lines with <SAMP>`AL'</SAMP> as to insert one line with <SAMP>`al'</SAMP>.
