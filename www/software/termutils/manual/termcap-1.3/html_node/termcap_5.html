<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC5">Interrogating the Terminal Description</A></H2>

<P>
Each piece of information recorded in a terminal description is called a
<EM>capability</EM>.  Each defined terminal capability has a two-letter code
name and a specific meaning.  For example, the number of columns is named
<SAMP>`co'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="termcap_23.html#SEC23">Definitions of the Terminal Capabilities</A>, for definitions of all the standard
capability names.

</P>
<P>
Once you have found the proper terminal description with <CODE>tgetent</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="termcap_4.html#SEC4">Finding a Terminal Description: <CODE>tgetent</CODE></A>), your application program must <EM>interrogate</EM> it for
various terminal capabilities.  You must specify the two-letter code of
the capability whose value you seek.

</P>
<P>
Capability values can be numeric, boolean (capability is either present or
absent) or strings.  Any particular capability always has the same value
type; for example, <SAMP>`co'</SAMP> always has a numeric value, while <SAMP>`am'</SAMP>
(automatic wrap at margin) is always a flag, and <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP> (cursor motion
command) always has a string value.  The documentation of each capability
says which type of value it has.
</P>
<P>
There are three functions to use to get the value of a capability,
depending on the type of value the capability has.  Here are their
declarations in ANSI C:

<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>

<PRE>
int tgetnum (char *<VAR>name</VAR>);
int tgetflag (char *<VAR>name</VAR>);
char *tgetstr (char *<VAR>name</VAR>, char **<VAR>area</VAR>);
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>tgetnum</CODE>
<DD>
Use <CODE>tgetnum</CODE> to get a capability value that is numeric.  The
argument <VAR>name</VAR> is the two-letter code name of the capability.  If
the capability is present, <CODE>tgetnum</CODE> returns the numeric value
(which is nonnegative).  If the capability is not mentioned in the
terminal description, <CODE>tgetnum</CODE> returns -1.

<DT><CODE>tgetflag</CODE>
<DD>
Use <CODE>tgetflag</CODE> to get a boolean value.  If the capability
<VAR>name</VAR> is present in the terminal description, <CODE>tgetflag</CODE>
returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

<DT><CODE>tgetstr</CODE>
<DD>
Use <CODE>tgetstr</CODE> to get a string value.  It returns a pointer to a
string which is the capability value, or a null pointer if the
capability is not present in the terminal description.

There are two ways <CODE>tgetstr</CODE> can find space to store the string value:


<UL>
<LI>

You can ask <CODE>tgetstr</CODE> to allocate the space.  Pass a null
pointer for the argument <VAR>area</VAR>, and <CODE>tgetstr</CODE> will use
<CODE>malloc</CODE> to allocate storage big enough for the value.
Termcap will never free this storage or refer to it again; you
should free it when you are finished with it.

This method is more robust, since there is no need to guess how
much space is needed.  But it is supported only by the GNU
termcap library.

<LI>

You can provide the space.  Provide for the argument <VAR>area</VAR> the
address of a pointer variable of type <CODE>char *</CODE>.  Before calling
<CODE>tgetstr</CODE>, initialize the variable to point at available space.
Then <CODE>tgetstr</CODE> will store the string value in that space and will
increment the pointer variable to point after the space that has been
used.  You can use the same pointer variable for many calls to
<CODE>tgetstr</CODE>.

There is no way to determine how much space is needed for a single
string, and no way for you to prevent or handle overflow of the area
you have provided.  However, you can be sure that the total size of
all the string values you will obtain from the terminal description is
no greater than the size of the description (unless you get the same
capability twice).  You can determine that size with <CODE>strlen</CODE> on
the buffer you provided to <CODE>tgetent</CODE>.  See below for an example.

Providing the space yourself is the only method supported by the Unix
version of termcap.

<P>
Note that you do not have to specify a terminal type or terminal
description for the interrogation functions.  They automatically use the
description found by the most recent call to <CODE>tgetent</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Here is an example of interrogating a terminal description for various
capabilities, with conditionals to select between the Unix and GNU methods
of providing buffer space.

</P>

<PRE>
char *tgetstr ();

char *cl_string, *cm_string;
int height;
int width;
int auto_wrap;

char PC;   /* For tputs.  */
char *BC;  /* For tgoto.  */
char *UP;

interrogate_terminal ()
{
#ifdef Unix
  /* Here we assume that an explicit term_buffer
     was provided to tgetent.  */
  char *buffer
    = (char *) malloc (strlen (term_buffer));
#define BUFFADDR &#38;buffer
#else
#define BUFFADDR 0
#endif

  char *temp;

  /* Extract information we will use.  */
  cl_string = tgetstr ("cl", BUFFADDR);
  cm_string = tgetstr ("cm", BUFFADDR);
  auto_wrap = tgetflag ("am");
  height = tgetnum ("li");
  width = tgetnum ("co");

  /* Extract information that termcap functions use.  */
  temp = tgetstr ("pc", BUFFADDR);
  PC = temp ? *temp : 0;
  BC = tgetstr ("le", BUFFADDR);
  UP = tgetstr ("up", BUFFADDR);
}
