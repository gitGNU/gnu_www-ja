<P>
Most types of terminal have commands that take longer to execute than they
do to send over a high-speed line.  For example, clearing the screen may
take 20msec once the entire command is received.  During that time, on a
9600 bps line, the terminal could receive about 20 additional output
characters while still busy clearing the screen.  Every terminal has a
certain amount of buffering capacity to remember output characters that
cannot be processed yet, but too many slow commands in a row can cause the
buffer to fill up.  Then any additional output that cannot be processed
immediately will be lost.

</P>
<P>
To avoid this problem, we normally follow each display command with enough
useless charaters (usually null characters) to fill up the time that the
display command needs to execute.  This does the job if the terminal throws
away null characters without using up space in the buffer (which most
terminals do).  If enough padding is used, no output can ever be lost.  The
right amount of padding avoids loss of output without slowing down
operation, since the time used to transmit padding is time that nothing
else could be done.

</P>
<P>
The number of padding characters needed for an operation depends on the
line speed.  In fact, it is proportional to the line speed.  A 9600 baud
line transmits about one character per msec, so the clear screen command in
the example above would need about 20 characters of padding.  At 1200 baud,
however, only about 3 characters of padding are needed to fill up 20msec.
