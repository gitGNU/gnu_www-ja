<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC22">When Changes in the Data Base Take Effect</A></H2>

<P>
Each application program must read the terminal description from the
data base, so a change in the data base is effective for all jobs started
after the change is made.

</P>
<P>
The change will usually have no effect on a job that have been in existence
since before the change. The program probably read the terminal description
once, when it was started, and is continuing to use what it read then.
If the program does not have a feature for reexamining the data base, then
you will need to run it again (probably killing the old job).

</P>
<P>
If the description in use is coming from the <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> environment
variable, then the data base file is effectively overridden, and changes in
it will have no effect until you change the <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> variable as
well.  For example, some users' <TT>`.login'</TT> files automatically copy the
terminal description into <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> to speed startup of applications.
If you have done this, you will need to change the <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> variable
to make the changed data base take effect.
