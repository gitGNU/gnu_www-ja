<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="termcap_toc.html#TOC4">Finding a Terminal Description: <CODE>tgetent</CODE></A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
An application program that is going to use termcap must first look up the
description of the terminal type in use.  This is done by calling
<CODE>tgetent</CODE>, whose declaration in ANSI Standard C looks like:

</P>

<PRE>
int tgetent (char *<VAR>buffer</VAR>, char *<VAR>termtype</VAR>);
</PRE>

<P>
This function finds the description and remembers it internally so that
you can interrogate it about specific terminal capabilities
(see section <A HREF="termcap_5.html#SEC5">Interrogating the Terminal Description</A>).

</P>
<P>
The argument <VAR>termtype</VAR> is a string which is the name for the type of
terminal to look up.  Usually you would obtain this from the environment
variable <CODE>TERM</CODE> using <CODE>getenv ("TERM")</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the GNU version of termcap, you can alternatively ask
<CODE>tgetent</CODE> to allocate enough space.  Pass a null pointer for
<VAR>buffer</VAR>, and <CODE>tgetent</CODE> itself allocates the storage using
<CODE>malloc</CODE>.  There is no way to get the address that was allocated,
and you shouldn't try to free the storage.
</P>
<P>
With the Unix version of termcap, you must allocate space for the
description yourself and pass the address of the space as the argument
<VAR>buffer</VAR>.  There is no way you can tell how much space is needed, so
the convention is to allocate a buffer 2048 characters long and assume that
is enough.  (Formerly the convention was to allocate 1024 characters and
assume that was enough.  But one day, for one kind of terminal, that was
not enough.)

</P>
<P>
No matter how the space to store the description has been obtained,
termcap records its address internally for use when you later interrogate
the description with <CODE>tgetnum</CODE>, <CODE>tgetstr</CODE> or <CODE>tgetflag</CODE>.  If
the buffer was allocated by termcap, it will be freed by termcap too if you
call <CODE>tgetent</CODE> again.  If the buffer was provided by you, you must
make sure that its contents remain unchanged for as long as you still plan
to interrogate the description.
</P>
<P>
The return value of <CODE>tgetent</CODE> is -1 if there is some difficulty
accessing the data base of terminal types, 0 if the data base is accessible
but the specified type is not defined in it, and some other value
otherwise.

</P>
<P>
Here is how you might use the function <CODE>tgetent</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
#ifdef unix
static char term_buffer[2048];
#else
#define term_buffer 0
#endif

init_terminal_data ()
{
  char *termtype = getenv ("TERM");
  int success;

  if (termtype == 0)
    fatal ("Specify a terminal type with `setenv TERM &#60;yourtype&#62;'.\n");

  success = tgetent (term_buffer, termtype);
  if (success &#60; 0)
    fatal ("Could not access the termcap data base.\n");
  if (success == 0)
    fatal ("Terminal type `%s' is not defined.\n", termtype);
}
</PRE>

<P>
Here we assume the function <CODE>fatal</CODE> prints an error message and exits.

</P>
<P>
If the environment variable <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> is defined, its value is used to
override the terminal type data base.  The function <CODE>tgetent</CODE> checks
the value of <CODE>TERMCAP</CODE> automatically.  If the value starts with
<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> then it is taken as a file name to use as the data base file,
instead of <TT>`/etc/termcap'</TT> which is the standard data base.  If the
value does not start with <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> then it is itself used as the terminal
description, provided that the terminal type <VAR>termtype</VAR> is among the
types it claims to apply to.  See section <A HREF="termcap_17.html#SEC17">The Format of the Data Base</A>, for information on the
format of a terminal description.
