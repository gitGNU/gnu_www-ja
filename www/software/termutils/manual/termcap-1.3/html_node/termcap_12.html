Some terminal control strings require numeric <EM>parameters</EM>.  For
example, when you move the cursor, you need to say what horizontal and
vertical positions to move it to.  The value of the terminal's <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP>
capability, which says how to move the cursor, cannot simply be a string of
characters; it must say how to express the cursor position numbers and
where to put them within the command.

</P>
<P>
The specifications of termcap include conventions as to which string-valued
capabilities require parameters, how many parameters, and what the
parameters mean; for example, it defines the <SAMP>`cm'</SAMP> string to take
two parameters, the vertical and horizontal positions, with 0,0 being the
upper left corner.  These conventions are described where the individual
commands are documented.

</P>
<P>
Termcap also defines a language used within the capability definition for
specifying how and where to encode the parameters for output.  This language
uses character sequences starting with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>.  (This is the same idea as
<CODE>printf</CODE>, but the details are different.)  The language for parameter
encoding is described in this section.

</P>
<P>
A program that is doing display output calls the functions <CODE>tparam</CODE> or
<CODE>tgoto</CODE> to encode parameters according to the specifications.  These
functions produce a string containing the actual commands to be output (as
well a padding spec which must be processed with <CODE>tputs</CODE>;
see section <A HREF="termcap_7.html#SEC7">Padding</A>).
