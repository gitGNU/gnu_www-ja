<p>SXML is looking for a maintainer.  If you're interested, please take
a look at this <a href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general
information about GNU packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then
email maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and
particular interest in this package.  Thanks.</p>

<P>
SXML is a tool to define and implement at same time a markup language.
Given a document containing user defined tags and their definition a
new document is produced. The new document is generated replacing
the tags with their definition (it is possible to associate functions
to tags). SXML supports the XML 1.0 syntax excluded entity support and
documents' DTDs.

<P>
SXML can be used in several ways.
With SXML it is possible to use XML <em>now</em> to define Web sites
that are accessible by all browsers: the output will be standard HTML.
At our department we mantain a lot of web sites using this tool.
Another way to use SXML is as a module in a generation system: the system
generates the SXML document that will be transformed in the target language.
You can also write a document in your markup language and then compile it
to different output languages. The capability of executing guile code,
perl functions and shell commands in tags' definition make it possible
to automate several tasks.
