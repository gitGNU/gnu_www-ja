your hacking pleasure.)

<P>
CVS is a version control system, and important component of
Source Configuration Management (SCM).  
Using it, you can record the history of sources files, and documents.  
It fills a similar role to the free software 
<A HREF="/software/rcs/rcs.html">RCS</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~jmacd/prcs.html">PRCS</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/aegis.html">Aegis</A>
packages.

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS Information
Page</A> contains detailed, and current information on CVS.

<P>
The online manual is also available at 
<A HREF="/software/cvs/manual/">www.gnu.org/software/cvs/manual/</A>

CVS is a production quality system in wide use around the world, including
many free software projects.<P>

While CVS stores individual file history in the same format as RCS, it
offers the following significant advantages over RCS:

<UL>

<LI> 

It can run scripts which you can supply to log CVS operations or enforce 
site-specific policies. 

<LI> 

<STRONG>Client/server CVS</STRONG> enables developers scattered by geography or slow
modems to function as a single team.  The version history is stored on
a single central server and the client machines have a copy of all the
files that the developers are working on.  Therefore, the network
between the client and the server must be up to perform CVS operations
(such as checkins or updates) but need not be up to edit or manipulate the
current versions of the files.  Clients can perform all the same
operations which
are available locally.

<LI>

In cases where several developers or teams want to each maintain
their own version of the files, because of geography and/or policy,
CVS's <STRONG>vendor branches</STRONG> can import a version from another team
(even if they don't use CVS), and then CVS can merge the changes from
the vendor branch with the latest files if that is what is desired.

<LI>

<STRONG>Unreserved checkouts</STRONG>, allowing more than one developer to work on
the same files at the same time.

<LI>

CVS provides a flexible <STRONG>modules database</STRONG> that provides a symbolic
mapping of names to components of a larger software distribution.  It
applies names to collections of directories and files.  A single
command can manipulate the entire collection.

<LI> 
CVS servers run on most Unix variants, and clients for Windows and VMS
are also available.  CVS will also operate in non-client/server mode on
Windows 95/NT.
