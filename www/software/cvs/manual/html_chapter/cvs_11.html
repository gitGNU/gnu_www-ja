</P>
<P>
To add a new file to a directory, follow these steps.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You must have a working copy of the directory.
See section <A HREF="cvs_4.html#SEC11">Getting the source</A>.

<LI>

Create the new file inside your working copy of the directory.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs add <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to tell CVS that you
want to version control the file.  If the file contains
binary data, specify <SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs_18.html#SEC83">Handling binary files</A>).

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`cvs commit <VAR>filename</VAR>'</SAMP> to actually check
in the file into the repository.  Other developers
cannot see the file until you perform this step.
</UL>

<P>
You can also use the <CODE>add</CODE> command to add a new
directory.

</P>
<P>
Unlike most other commands, the <CODE>add</CODE> command is
not recursive.  You cannot even type <SAMP>`cvs add
foo/bar'</SAMP>!  Instead, you have to

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd foo
$ cvs add bar
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cvs add</B> <I>[<CODE>-k</CODE> kflag] [<CODE>-m</CODE> message] files ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX245"></A>

</P>
<P>
Schedule <VAR>files</VAR> to be added to the repository.
The files or directories specified with <CODE>add</CODE> must
already exist in the current directory.  To add a whole
new directory hierarchy to the source repository (for
example, files received from a third-party vendor), use
the <CODE>import</CODE> command instead.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC112">import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches</A>.

</P>
<P>
The added files are not placed in the source repository
until you use <CODE>commit</CODE> to make the change
permanent.  Doing an <CODE>add</CODE> on a file that was
removed with the <CODE>remove</CODE> command will undo the
effect of the <CODE>remove</CODE>, unless a <CODE>commit</CODE>
command intervened.  See section <A HREF="cvs_12.html#SEC62">Removing files from a module</A>, for an
example.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option specifies the default way that
this file will be checked out; for more information see
section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC81">Substitution modes</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option specifies a description for the
file.  This description appears in the history log (if
it is enabled, see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC149">The history file</A>).  It will also be
saved in the version history inside the repository when
the file is committed.  The <CODE>log</CODE> command displays
this description.  The description can be changed using
<SAMP>`admin -t'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC91">admin--Administration front end for rcs</A>.  If you omit the
<SAMP>`-m <VAR>description</VAR>'</SAMP> flag, an empty string will
be used.  You will not be prompted for a description.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
For example, the following commands add the file
<TT>`backend.c'</TT> to the repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs add backend.c
$ cvs commit -m "Early version. Not yet compilable." backend.c
</PRE>

<P>
When you add a file it is added only on the branch
which you are working on (see section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC50">Branches</A>).  You can
later merge the additions to another branch if you want
(see section <A HREF="cvs_9.html#SEC59">Merging can add or remove files</A>).
