CVS stores all files in a centralized
<EM>repository</EM> (see section <A HREF="cvs_5.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>).

</P>
<P>
The repository contains directories and files, in an
arbitrary tree.  The <EM>modules</EM> feature can be used
to group together a set of directories or files into a
single entity (see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>).  A typical usage is to
define one module per project.

Each version of a file has a unique <EM>revision
number</EM>.  Revision numbers look like <SAMP>`1.1'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`1.2'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`1.3.2.2'</SAMP> or even <SAMP>`1.3.2.2.4.5'</SAMP>.
A revision number always has an even number of
period-separated decimal integers.  By default revision
1.1 is the first revision of a file.  Each successive
revision is given a new number by increasing the
rightmost number by one.  The following figure displays
a few revisions, with newer revisions to the right.

<P>
CVS is not limited to linear development.  The
<EM>revision tree</EM> can be split into <EM>branches</EM>,
where each branch is a self-maintained line of
development.  Changes made on one branch can easily be
moved back to the main trunk.  

</P>
<P>
Each branch has a <EM>branch number</EM>, consisting of an
odd number of period-separated decimal integers.  The
branch number is created by appending an integer to the
revision number where the corresponding branch forked
off.  Having branch numbers allows more than one branch
to be forked off from a certain revision.

</P>
<P>
All revisions on a branch have revision numbers formed
by appending an ordinal number to the branch number.
The following figure illustrates branching with an
example.

<P>
The exact details of how the branch number is
constructed is not something you normally need to be
concerned about, but here is how it works: When
CVS creates a branch number it picks the first
unused even integer, starting with 2.  So when you want
to create a branch from revision 6.4 it will be
numbered 6.4.2.  All branch numbers ending in a zero
(such as 6.4.0) are used internally by CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs_23.html#SEC153">Magic branch numbers</A>).  The branch 1.1.1 has a
special meaning.  See section <A HREF="cvs_13.html#SEC63">Tracking third-party sources</A>.

A file can have several versions, as described above.
Likewise, a software product can have several versions.
A software product is often given a version number such
as <SAMP>`4.1.1'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Versions in the first sense are called <EM>revisions</EM>
in this document, and versions in the second sense are
called <EM>releases</EM>.  To avoid confusion, the word
<EM>version</EM> is almost never used in this document.
