This appendix describes how to invoke CVS, and
describes in detail those subcommands of CVS which
are not fully described elsewhere.  To look up a
particular subcommand, see section <A HREF="cvs_25.html#SEC155">Index</A>.

cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cvs</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the CVS program.

<DT><CODE>cvs_options</CODE>
<DD>
Some options that affect all sub-commands of CVS.  These are
described below.

<DT><CODE>cvs_command</CODE>
<DD>
One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>: <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> elicits a
list of available commands, and <SAMP>`cvs -v'</SAMP> displays version
information on CVS itself.

<DT><CODE>command_options</CODE>
<DD>
Options that are specific for the command.

<DT><CODE>command_args</CODE>
<DD>
Arguments to the commands.
</DL>

<P>
There is unfortunately some confusion between
<CODE>cvs_options</CODE> and <CODE>command_options</CODE>.
<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, when given as a <CODE>cvs_option</CODE>, only
affects some of the commands.  When it is given as a
<CODE>command_option</CODE> is has a different meaning, and
is accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC88" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC88">Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are some <CODE>command_options</CODE> that are used so
often that you might have set up an alias or some other
means to make sure you always specify that option.  One
example (the one that drove the implementation of the
.cvsrc support, actually) is that many people find the
default output of the <SAMP>`diff'</SAMP> command to be very
hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs
are much easier to understand.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file is a way that you can add
default options to <CODE>cvs_commands</CODE> within cvs,
instead of relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

</P>
<P>
The format of the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file is simple.  The
file is searched for a line that begins with the same
name as the <CODE>cvs_command</CODE> being executed.  If a
match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and
added to the command arguments <EM>before</EM> any
options from the command line.

</P>
<P>
If a command has two names (e.g., <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>co</CODE>), the official name, not necessarily the one
used on the command line, will be used to match against
the file.  So if this is the contents of the user's
<TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
log -N
diff -u
update -P
co -P
</PRE>

<P>
the command <SAMP>`cvs checkout foo'</SAMP> would have the
<SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> option added to the arguments, as well as
<SAMP>`cvs co foo'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
With the example file above, the output from <SAMP>`cvs
diff foobar'</SAMP> will be in unidiff format.  <SAMP>`cvs diff
-c foobar'</SAMP> will provide context diffs, as usual.
Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because <CODE>diff</CODE> doesn't have an option
to specify use of the "old" format, so you would need
<SAMP>`cvs -f diff foobar'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
In place of the command name you can use <CODE>cvs</CODE> to
specify global options (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC89">Global options</A>).  For
example the following line in <TT>`.cvsrc'</TT>

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -z6

The available <SAMP>`cvs_options'</SAMP> (that are given to the
left of <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>) are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>bindir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX306"></A>
 
Use <VAR>bindir</VAR> as the directory where RCS programs are
located.  Overrides the setting of the <CODE>$RCSBIN</CODE> environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.

<A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
<DT><CODE>-T <VAR>tempdir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>tempdir</VAR> as the directory where temporary files are
located.  Overrides the setting of the <CODE>$TMPDIR</CODE> environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.

<A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>cvs_root_directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>cvs_root_directory</VAR> as the root directory
pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting of
the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable.  See section <A HREF="cvs_5.html#SEC15">The Repository</A>.

<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>editor</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>editor</VAR> to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
setting of the <CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> and <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> environment variables.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Do not read the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> file.  This
option is most often used because of the
non-orthogonality of the CVS option set.  For
example, the <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> option <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> (turn off
display of tag names) does not have a corresponding
option to turn the display on.  So if you have
<SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> in the <TT>`~/.cvsrc'</TT> entry for <SAMP>`log'</SAMP>,
you may need to use <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> to show the tag names.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
Display usage information about the specified <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>
(but do not actually execute the command).  If you don't specify
a command name, <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> displays a summary of all the
commands available.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Do not log the cvs_command in the command history (but execute it
anyway).  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC110">history--Show status of files and users</A>, for information on command history.

<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the
<SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.

<DT><CODE>-Q</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
generate output for serious problems.

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
suppressed.

<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD>
Make new working files files read-only.  Same effect
as if the <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is set
(see section <A HREF="cvs_22.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>).  The default is to
make working files writable, unless watches are on
(see section <A HREF="cvs_7.html#SEC43">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>).

<DT><CODE>-s <VAR>variable</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set a user variable (see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC150">Expansions in administrative files</A>).

<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>
<DD>
Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of
CVS activity.  Particularly useful with <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> to explore the
potential impact of an unfamiliar command.

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD>
Display version and copyright information for CVS.

<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>
Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the
setting of the <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable.
Files are created read-write by default, unless <CODE>$CVSREAD</CODE> is
set or <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is given.

<DT><CODE>-x</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt all communication between the client and the
server.  Only has an effect on the CVS client.  As
of this writing, this is only implemented when using a
Kerberos connection (see section <A HREF="cvs_5.html#SEC30">Direct connection with kerberos</A>).
Encryption support is not available by default; it must
be enabled using a special configure option,
<TT>`--enable-encryption'</TT>, when you build CVS.

<DT><CODE>-z <VAR>gzip-level</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the compression level.  Only has an effect on the
CVS client.

<H2><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC90">Common command options</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<A NAME="IDX319"></A>

</P>
<P>
This section describes the <SAMP>`command_options'</SAMP> that
are available across several CVS commands.  These
options are always given to the right of
<SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>. Not all
commands support all of these options; each option is
only supported for commands where it makes sense.
However, when a command has one of these options you
can almost always count on the same behavior of the
option as in other commands.  (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have
different behavior from one CVS command to the other).

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`history'</SAMP> command is an exception; it supports
many options that conflict even with these standard options.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date_spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX321"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX322"></A>
 
Use the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date_spec</VAR>.
<VAR>date_spec</VAR> is a single argument, a date description
specifying a date in the past.

The specification is <EM>sticky</EM> when you use it to make a
private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working
file using <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>, CVS records the date you specified, so that
further updates in the same directory will use the same date
(for more information on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>).

<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
A wide variety of date formats are supported by
CVS.  The <VAR>date_spec</VAR> is interpreted as being
in the local timezone, unless a specific timezone is
specified.  Examples of valid date specifications
include:


<PRE>
                    1 month ago
                    2 hours ago
                    400000 seconds ago
                    last year
                    last Monday
                    yesterday
                    a fortnight ago
                    3/31/92 10:00:07 PST
                    January 23, 1987 10:05pm
                    22:00 GMT
</PRE>

<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>,
<CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.
(The <CODE>history</CODE> command uses this option in a
slightly different way; see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC111">history options</A>).  Note
that when specifying a date like <SAMP>`3/31/92'</SAMP> it is
<CODE><VAR>month</VAR>/<VAR>day</VAR>/<VAR>year</VAR></CODE>.  So
<SAMP>`1/4/96'</SAMP> is January 4, not March 1.

Remember to quote the argument to the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag so that your shell doesn't interpret spaces as
argument separators.  A command using the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag can look like this:


<PRE>
$ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
When you specify a particular date or tag to CVS commands, they
normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option
if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
will be used). 

<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> is available with these commands: <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG>  The <CODE>commit</CODE> command also has a
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, but it has a different behavior for
that command.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC100">commit options</A>.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
Help; describe the options available for this command.  This is
the only option supported for all CVS commands.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Alter the default RCS processing of keywords.
See section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>, for the meaning of
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  Your <VAR>kflag</VAR> specification is
<EM>sticky</EM> when you use it to create a private copy
of a source file; that is, when you use this option
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> commands,
CVS associates your selected <VAR>kflag</VAR> with the
file, and continues to use it with future update
commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.

The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option is available with the <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory, rather than
recursing through subdirectories.  

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same
as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -l'</SAMP> option, which you can specify to the
left of a cvs command!

Available with the following commands: <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>log</CODE>,
<CODE>remove</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>,
<CODE>status</CODE>, <CODE>tag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
<A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>message</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>message</VAR> as log information, instead of
invoking an editor.

Available with the following commands: <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE> and <CODE>import</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any checkout/commit/tag program.  (A program can be
specified to run on each of these activities, in the modules
database (see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>); this option bypasses it). 

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -n'</SAMP>
option, which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

Available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
and <CODE>rtag</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>
Prune (remove) directories that are empty after being updated, on
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, or <CODE>update</CODE>.  Normally, an empty directory
(one that is void of revision-controlled files) is left alone.
Specifying <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> will cause these directories to be silently
removed from your checked-out sources.  This does not remove the
directory from the repository, only from your checked out copy.
Note that this option is implied by the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
options of <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>export</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output,
rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-W</CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can
use this option repeatedly.  The spec can be a file
name pattern of the same type that you can specify in
the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT> file.
Avaliable with the following commands: <CODE>import</CODE>,
and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use the revision specified by the <VAR>tag</VAR> argument instead of the
default <EM>head</EM> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined
with the <CODE>tag</CODE> or <CODE>rtag</CODE> command, two special tags are
always available: <SAMP>`HEAD'</SAMP> refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and <SAMP>`BASE'</SAMP> refers to the
revision you last checked out into the current working directory.

The tag specification is sticky when you use this
with <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> to make your own
copy of a file: CVS remembers the tag and continues to use it on
future update commands, until you specify otherwise (for more information
on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>).  The
tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag.
See section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC51">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>.

Specifying the <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> global option along with the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> command option is often useful, to suppress
the warning messages when the RCS history file
does not contain the specified tag.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall `cvs -r' option,
which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>,
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

Requires: repository, working directory.

Synonym: rcs
</UL>

<P>
This is the CVS interface to assorted administrative RCS
facilities, documented in rcs(1).  <CODE>admin</CODE> simply passes
all its options and arguments to the <CODE>rcs</CODE> command; it does
no filtering or other processing.  This command <EM>does</EM> work
recursively, however, so extreme care should be used.

</P>
<P>
If there is a group whose name matches a compiled in
value which defaults to <CODE>cvsadmin</CODE>, only members
of that group can use <CODE>cvs admin</CODE>.  To disallow
<CODE>cvs admin</CODE> for all users, create a group with no
users in it.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC92">admin options</A></H3>

<P>
Not all valid <CODE>rcs</CODE> options are useful together
with CVS.  Some even makes it impossible to use
CVS until you undo the effect!

</P>
<P>
This description of the available options is based on
the <SAMP>`rcs(1)'</SAMP> man page, but modified to suit
readers that are more interrested in CVS than
RCS.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>oldfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
access list of <VAR>oldfile</VAR> to the access list of the
RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-a<VAR>logins</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
login names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> to the access list of the RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-b[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
When used with bare RCS, this
option sets the default branch to <VAR>rev</VAR>; in
CVS sticky tags (see section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>) are a better
way to decide which branch you want to work on.  With
CVS, this option can be used to control behavior
with respect to the vendor branch.

<DT><CODE>-c<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Sets the comment leader to
<VAR>string</VAR>.  The comment leader is printed before
every log message line generated by the keyword
<CODE>$</CODE>Log$ (see section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>).
This is useful for programming languages without
multi-line comments.  RCS initially guesses the
value of the comment leader from the file name
extension when the file is first committed.

<DT><CODE>-e[<VAR>logins</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Erase the login
names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> from the access list of the RCS file.  If
<VAR>logins</VAR> is omitted, erase the entire access list.

<DT><CODE>-I</CODE>
<DD>
Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a
terminal.

<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS.  When using bare RCS, this
is used to create and initialize a new RCS file,
without depositing a revision.

<DT><CODE>-k<VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the default keyword
substitution to <VAR>subst</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>.  Giving an explicit <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option to
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>, <CODE>cvs export</CODE>, or <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> overrides this default.

<DT><CODE>-l[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the revision with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch
is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If
<VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, lock the latest revision on the
default branch.

This can be used in conjunction with the
<TT>`rcslock.pl'</TT> script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT>
directory of the CVS source distribution to
provide reserved checkouts (where only one user can be
editing a given file at a time).  See the comments in
that file for details (and see the <TT>`README'</TT> file
in that directory for disclaimers about the unsupported
nature of contrib).  According to comments in that
file, locking must set to strict (which is the default).

<DT><CODE>-L</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the
owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option above.

<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>rev</VAR>:<VAR>msg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Replace the log message of revision <VAR>rev</VAR> with
<VAR>msg</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-N<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Act like <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, except override any previous
assignment of <VAR>name</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-n<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Associate the symbolic name <VAR>name</VAR> with the branch
or revision <VAR>rev</VAR>.  It is normally better to use
<SAMP>`cvs tag'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs rtag'</SAMP> instead.  Delete the
symbolic name if both <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> and <VAR>rev</VAR> are
omitted; otherwise, print an error message if
<VAR>name</VAR> is already associated with another number.
If <VAR>rev</VAR> is symbolic, it is expanded before
association.  A <VAR>rev</VAR> consisting of a branch number
followed by a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> stands for the current latest
revision in the branch.  A <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> with an empty
<VAR>rev</VAR> stands for the current latest revision on the
default branch, normally the trunk.  For example,
<SAMP>`rcs -n<VAR>name</VAR>: RCS/*'</SAMP> associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the
current latest revision of all the named RCS files;
this contrasts with <SAMP>`rcs -n<VAR>name</VAR>:$ RCS/*'</SAMP> which
associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the revision numbers
extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding

<A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o<VAR>range</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Potentially useful, but dangerous, with CVS (see below).
Deletes (<EM>outdates</EM>) the revisions given by
<VAR>range</VAR>.  A range consisting of a single revision
number means that revision.  A range consisting of a
branch number means the latest revision on that branch.
A range of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>rev1</VAR>:<VAR>rev2</VAR>'</SAMP> means
revisions <VAR>rev1</VAR> to <VAR>rev2</VAR> on the same branch,
<SAMP>`:<VAR>rev</VAR>'</SAMP> means from the beginning of the
branch containing <VAR>rev</VAR> up to and including
<VAR>rev</VAR>, and <SAMP>`<VAR>rev</VAR>:'</SAMP> means from revision
<VAR>rev</VAR> to the end of the branch containing
<VAR>rev</VAR>.  None of the outdated revisions may have
branches or locks.

Due to the way CVS handles branches <VAR>rev</VAR>
cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.
See section <A HREF="cvs_23.html#SEC153">Magic branch numbers</A>, for an explanation.

Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For
this reason, this option is not a good way to take back
a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
change instead (see section <A HREF="cvs_9.html#SEC58">Merging differences between any two revisions</A>).

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

<DT><CODE>-s<VAR>state</VAR>[:<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the state attribute of the
revision <VAR>rev</VAR> to <VAR>state</VAR>.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is a
branch number, assume the latest revision on that
branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, assume the latest
revision on the default branch.  Any identifier is
acceptable for <VAR>state</VAR>.  A useful set of states is
<SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> (for experimental), <SAMP>`Stab'</SAMP> (for
stable), and <SAMP>`Rel'</SAMP> (for released).  By default,
the state of a new revision is set to <SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> when
it is created.  The state is visible in the output from
<VAR>cvs log</VAR> (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>), and in the
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Log$ and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>State$ keywords
(see section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>).  Note that CVS
uses the <CODE>dead</CODE> state for its own purposes; to
take a file to or from the <CODE>dead</CODE> state use
commands like <CODE>cvs remove</CODE> and <CODE>cvs add</CODE>, not
<CODE>cvs admin -s</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-t[<VAR>file</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Write descriptive text from the
contents of the named <VAR>file</VAR> into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.  The <VAR>file</VAR> pathname
may not begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  If <VAR>file</VAR> is omitted,
obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> by itself.
Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.  The descriptive text can be seen in the
output from <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>).

<DT><CODE>-t-<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Similar to <SAMP>`-t<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>. Write descriptive text
from the <VAR>string</VAR> into the RCS file, deleting
the existing text.

<DT><CODE>-U</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means
that the owner of a file need not lock a revision for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option
above.

<DT><CODE>-u[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
See the option <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> above, for a discussion of
using this option with CVS.  Unlock the revision
with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch is given, unlock
the latest revision on that branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is
omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock it.
Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock.
This causes a mail message to be sent to the original
locker.  The message contains a commentary solicited
from the breaker.  The commentary is terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <CODE>.</CODE> by itself.

<DT><CODE>-V<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Emulate RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>. Use -V<VAR>n</VAR> to make
an RCS file acceptable to RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>
by discarding information that would confuse version
<VAR>n</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-x<VAR>suffixes</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS. Use <VAR>suffixes</VAR> to
characterize RCS files.

<H4><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC94">Outdating is dangerous</A></H4>

<P>
First, an example of how <EM>not</EM> to use the
<CODE>admin</CODE> command.  It is included to stress the
fact that this command can be quite dangerous unless
you know <EM>exactly</EM> what you are doing.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option can be used to <EM>outdate</EM> old revisions
from the history file.  If you are short on disc this option
might help you.  But think twice before using it--there is no
way short of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!

</P>
<P>
The next line is an example of a command that you would
<EM>not</EM> like to execute.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -o:R_1_02 .
</PRE>

<P>
The above command will delete all revisions up to, and
including, the revision that corresponds to the tag
R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not
changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have
<EM>the same</EM> numerical revision number assigned to
the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only will it be
impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to
be restored from the tapes!

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...
<LI>

Requires: repository.
<LI>

Changes: working directory.
<LI>

Synonyms: co, get
</UL>

<P>
Make a working directory containing copies of the
source files specified by <VAR>modules</VAR>.  You must execute
<CODE>checkout</CODE> before using most of the other CVS
commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>modules</VAR> part of the command are either
symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic
names are defined in the <SAMP>`modules'</SAMP> file.
See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>.

</P>
<P>
Depending on the modules you specify, <CODE>checkout</CODE> may
recursively create directories and populate them with
the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these
source files at any time (regardless of whether other
software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by
others to the source repository; or commit your work as
a permanent change to the source repository.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>checkout</CODE> is used to create
directories.  The top-level directory created is always
added to the directory where <CODE>checkout</CODE> is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified
module.  In the case of a module alias, the created
sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
<CODE>checkout</CODE> will show the relative path leading to
each file as it is extracted into your private work
area (unless you specify the <SAMP>`-Q'</SAMP> global option).

</P>
<P>
The files created by <CODE>checkout</CODE> are created
read-write, unless the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option to CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC89">Global options</A>) is specified, the
<CODE>CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is specified
(see section <A HREF="cvs_22.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>), or a watch is in
effect for that file (see section <A HREF="cvs_7.html#SEC43">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>).

</P>
<P>
Running <CODE>checkout</CODE> on a directory that was already
built by a prior <CODE>checkout</CODE> is also permitted, and
has the same effect as specifying the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option
to the <CODE>update</CODE> command, that is, any new
directories that have been created in the repository
will appear in your work area.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>

This option is sticky, and implies <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>.  See
section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful with the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r
<VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP> flags.  If no matching revision is found,
retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring
the file).

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Process RCS keywords according to <VAR>kflag</VAR>.  See
co(1).  This option is sticky; future updates of
this file in this working directory will use the same
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  The <CODE>status</CODE> command can be viewed
to see the sticky options.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC128">status--Display status information on checked out files</A>.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any checkout program (as specified
with the <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option in the modules file;

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>
Prune empty directories.

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>

Use revision <VAR>tag</VAR>.  This option is sticky, and implies <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to those, you can use these special command
options with <CODE>checkout</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A</CODE>
<DD>
Reset any sticky tags, dates, or <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> options.
See section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output,
instead of creating or modifying any files or
directories in your working directory.

<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Create a directory called <VAR>dir</VAR> for the working
files, instead of using the module name.  Unless you
also use <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>, the paths created under <VAR>dir</VAR>
will be as short as possible.

<DT><CODE>-j <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With two <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option to
the revision specified with the second <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> option,
into the working directory.

With one <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option.

In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<SAMP>`-j<VAR>Symbolic_Tag</VAR>:<VAR>Date_Specifier</VAR>'</SAMP>.

See section <A HREF="cvs_9.html#SEC55">Merging</A>.

<DT><CODE>-N</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful together with <SAMP>`-d <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>.  With this
option, CVS will not shorten module paths in your
working directory.  (Normally, CVS shortens paths as
much as possible when you specify an explicit target
directory).

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, but include the status of all modules,
and sort it by the status string.  See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>, for
info about the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option that is used inside the
modules file to set the module status.

Use <CODE>commit</CODE> when you want to incorporate changes
from your working source files into the source

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of
the files in your working current directory are
examined.  <CODE>commit</CODE> is careful to change in the
repository only those files that you have really
changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the
<SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option), files in subdirectories are also
examined and committed if they have changed; you can
use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to limit <CODE>commit</CODE> to the
current directory only.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>commit</CODE> verifies that the selected files are up
to date with the current revisions in the source
repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with <CODE>update</CODE> (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>).
<CODE>commit</CODE> does not call the <CODE>update</CODE> command
for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the

</P>
<P>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to
enter a log message that will be written to one or more
logging programs (see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>, and see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC144">Loginfo</A>)
and placed in the RCS history file inside the
repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
<CODE>log</CODE> command; See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>.  You can specify the
log message on the command line with the <SAMP>`-m
<VAR>message</VAR>'</SAMP> option, and thus avoid the editor invocation,
or use the <SAMP>`-f <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> option to specify

<H4><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC102">New major release number</A></H4>

<P>
When you make a major release of your product, you
might want the revision numbers to track your major
release number.  You should normally not care about
the revision numbers, but this is a thing that many
people want to do, and it can be done without doing any
harm.

</P>
<P>
To bring all your files up to the RCS revision 3.0
(including those that haven't changed), you might do:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -r 3.0
</PRE>

<P>
Note that it is generally a bad idea to try to make the
RCS revision number equal to the current release number
of your product.  You should think of the revision
number as an internal number that the CVS package
maintains, and that you generally never need to care
much about.  Using the <CODE>tag</CODE> and <CODE>rtag</CODE>
commands you can give symbolic names to the releases
instead.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC130">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A> and See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC126">rtag--Add a symbolic tag to a module</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the number you specify with <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> must be
larger than any existing revision number.  That is, if
revision 3.0 exists, you cannot <SAMP>`cvs commit
-r 1.3'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC103">Committing to a branch</A></H4>

<P>
You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an
even number of dots) with the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option.  To
create a branch revision, use the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option
of the <CODE>rtag</CODE> or <CODE>tag</CODE> commands (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC130">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A>
or see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC126">rtag--Add a symbolic tag to a module</A>).  Then, either <CODE>checkout</CODE> or
<CODE>update</CODE> can be used to base your sources on the
newly created branch.  From that point on, all
<CODE>commit</CODE> changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision,
thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the
1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
$ cd product_module
[[ hack away ]]
$ cvs commit
</PRE>

<P>
This works automatically since the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option is
sticky.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC104">Creating the branch after editing</A></H4>

<P>
Say you have been working on some extremely
experimental software, based on whatever revision you
happened to checkout last week.  If others in your
group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could
commit your change to a new branch.  Others can then
checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full
benefit of CVS conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:

</P>

<PRE>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
$ cvs update -r EXPR1
$ cvs commit
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>update</CODE> command will make the <SAMP>`-r
EXPR1'</SAMP> option sticky on all files.  Note that your
changes to the files will never be removed by the
<CODE>update</CODE> command.  The <CODE>commit</CODE> will
automatically commit to the correct branch, because the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is sticky.  You could also do like this:

</P>

<PRE>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
$ cvs commit -r EXPR1
</PRE>

<P>
but then, only those files that were changed by you
will have the <SAMP>`-r EXPR1'</SAMP> sticky flag.  If you hack
away, and commit without specifying the <SAMP>`-r EXPR1'</SAMP>
flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

</P>
<P>
To work with you on the experimental change, others
would simply do

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Compare with revision <VAR>tag</VAR>.  Zero, one or two
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> options can be present.  With no <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>
option, the working file will be compared with the
revision it was based on.  With one <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>, that
revision will be compared to your current working file.
With two <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> options those two revisions will be
compared (and your working file will not affect the
outcome in any way).

One or both <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> options can be replaced by a
<SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> option, described above.

Synopsis: export [-flNn] [-r rev|-D date] [-k subst] [-d dir] module...
<LI>

Requires: repository.
<LI>

Changes: current directory.
</UL>

<P>
This command is a variant of <CODE>checkout</CODE>; use it
when you want a copy of the source for module without
the CVS administrative directories.  For example, you
might use <CODE>export</CODE> to prepare source for shipment
off-site.  This command requires that you specify a
date or tag (with <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>), so that you
can count on reproducing the source you ship to others.

</P>
<P>
One often would like to use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP> with <CODE>cvs
export</CODE>.  This causes any RCS keywords to be
expanded such that an import done at some other site
will not lose the keyword revision information.  But be
aware that doesn't handle an export containing binary
files correctly.  Also be aware that after having used
<SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>, one can no longer use the <CODE>ident</CODE>
command (which is part of the RCS suite--see
ident(1)) which looks for RCS keyword strings.  If
you want to be able to use <CODE>ident</CODE> you must not
use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>.

</P>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>

<P>
Several options (shown above as <SAMP>`-report'</SAMP>)  control  what
kind of report is generated:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time
the repository was modified).

<DT><CODE>-e</CODE>
<DD>
Everything (all record types); equivalent to specifying
<SAMP>`-xMACFROGWUT'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully
use <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> more than once on the command line.)

<DT><CODE>-o</CODE>
<DD>
Report on checked-out modules.

<DT><CODE>-T</CODE>
<DD>
Report on all tags.

<DT><CODE>-x <VAR>type</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Extract a particular set of record types <VAR>type</VAR> from the CVS
history.  The types are indicated by single letters,
which you may specify in combination.  

Certain commands have a single record type: 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>F</CODE>
<DD>
release
<DT><CODE>O</CODE>

checkout
<DT><CODE>T</CODE>

One of four record types may result from an update:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>C</CODE>
<DD>
A merge was necessary but collisions were
detected (requiring manual merging).  
<DT><CODE>G</CODE>
<DD>
A merge was necessary and it succeeded.
<DT><CODE>U</CODE>
<DD>
A working file was copied from the repository.
<DT><CODE>W</CODE>
<DD>
The working copy of a file was deleted during
update (because it was gone from the repository).
</DL>

One of three record types results from commit:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>A</CODE>
<DD>
A file was added for the first time.
<DT><CODE>M</CODE>
<DD>
A file was modified.
<DT><CODE>R</CODE>
<DD>
A file was removed.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The options shown as <SAMP>`-flags'</SAMP> constrain or expand
the report without requiring option arguments:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>
Show data for all users (the default is to show data
only for the user executing <CODE>history</CODE>).

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Show last modification only.

<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>
Show only the records for modifications done from the
same working directory where <CODE>history</CODE> is
executing.
</DL>

<P>
The options shown as <SAMP>`-options <VAR>args</VAR>'</SAMP> constrain the report
based on an argument:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>str</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data back to a record containing  the  string
<VAR>str</VAR>  in  either the module name, the file name, or
the repository path.

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data since <VAR>date</VAR>.  This is slightly different
from the normal use of <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP>, which
selects the newest revision older than <VAR>date</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-p <VAR>repository</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data for a particular source repository  (you
can specify several <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> options on the same command
line).

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>rev</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records referring to revisions since the revision
or tag named <VAR>rev</VAR> appears in individual RCS
files.  Each RCS file is searched for the revision or
tag.

<DT><CODE>-t <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records since tag <VAR>tag</VAR> was last added to the the
history file.  This differs from the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> flag
above in that it reads only the history file, not the
RCS files, and is much faster.

<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records for user <VAR>name</VAR>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC112" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC112">import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX346"></A>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...
<LI>

Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
</UL>

<P>
Use <CODE>import</CODE> to incorporate an entire source
distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source
vendor) into your source repository directory.  You can
use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module
from the outside source.  See section <A HREF="cvs_13.html#SEC63">Tracking third-party sources</A>, for
a discussion on this subject.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>repository</VAR> argument gives a directory name
(or a path to a directory) under the CVS root directory
for repositories; if the directory did not exist,
import creates it.

</P>
<P>
When you use import for updates to source that has been
modified in your source repository (since a prior
import), it will notify you of any files that conflict
in the two branches of development; use <SAMP>`checkout
-j'</SAMP> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.

</P>
<P>
If CVS decides a file should be ignored
(see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>), it does not import it and prints
<SAMP>`I '</SAMP> followed by the filename (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC114">import output</A>, for a
complete description of the output).

</P>
<P>
If the file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers'</TT> exists,
any file whose names match the specifications in that
file will be treated as packages and the appropriate
filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported, See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

</P>
<P>
The outside source is saved in a first-level RCS
branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
branch; for example, files from the first imported
collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision
1.1.1.2, and so on.

</P>
<P>
At least three arguments are required.
<VAR>repository</VAR> is needed to identify the collection
of source.  <VAR>vendortag</VAR> is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at
least one <VAR>releasetag</VAR> to identify the files at
the leaves created each time you execute <CODE>import</CODE>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC113" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC113">import options</A></H3>

</DL>

<P>
There are three additional special options.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>branch</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a first-level branch other than 1.1.1.  Unless
the <SAMP>`-b <VAR>branch</VAR>'</SAMP> flag is given, revisions will
<EM>always</EM> be made to the branch 1.1.1--even if a
<VAR>vendortag</VAR> that matches another branch is given!
What happens in that case, is that the tag will be
reset to 1.1.1.  Warning: This behavior might change
in the future.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Indicate the RCS keyword expansion mode desired.  This
setting will apply to all files created during the
import, but not to any files that previously existed in
the repository.  See section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC81">Substitution modes</A> for a
list of valid <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> settings.

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be ignored during
import.  You can use this option repeatedly.  To avoid
ignoring any files at all (even those ignored by
default), specify `-I !'.

<VAR>name</VAR> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <TT>`.cvsignore'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>.

<DT><CODE>-W <VAR>spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered during
import.  You can use this option repeatedly.

<VAR>spec</VAR> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT>
file. See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>U <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally
modified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).

<DT><CODE>N <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.

<DT><CODE>C <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file already exists in the repository but has been locally modified;
you will have to merge the changes.

<DT><CODE>I <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is being ignored (see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>).

<DT><CODE>L <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is a symbolic link; at the moment (and for the forseeable
future), symbolic links are ignored.

Print only the name of the RCS history file.

<DT><CODE>-r<VAR>revisions</VAR></CODE>

Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The
summary includes information about files that were
changed or added between the releases.  It is sent to
the standard output device.  This is useful for finding
out, for example, which files have changed between two
dates or revisions.

A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard
output device.  This is most useful for seeing what the
last change to a file was.

<DT><CODE>-u</CODE>

Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.
This option is not available if your diff does not
support the unidiff format.  Remember that old versions
of the <CODE>patch</CODE> program can't handle the unidiff
format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net
you should probably not use <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP>.

Suppose you receive mail from <TT>foo@bar.com</TT> asking for an
update from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You
have no such patches on hand, but with CVS that can
easily be fixed with a command such as this:

<P>
This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
<SAMP>`cvs checkout'</SAMP>.  Since CVS doesn't lock files, it
isn't strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have
forgotten, and you leave no trace in the CVS history
file (see section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC149">The history file</A>) that you've abandoned your
checkout.

</P>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`cvs release'</SAMP> to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a CVS working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

</P>

If all these conditions are true, <SAMP>`cvs release'</SAMP>

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG>  The <CODE>release</CODE> command deletes
all directories and files recursively.  This

Use <CODE>tag</CODE> instead (see section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC130">tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files</A>), to base the

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>

Tag the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
Only useful with the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r <VAR>tag</VAR>'</SAMP>
flags.  If no matching revision is found, use the most
recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).

<DT><CODE>-F</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite an existing tag of the same name on a
different revision.  This option is new in CVS
1.4.  The old behavior is matched by <SAMP>`cvs tag -F'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>

Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>

<P>
In addition to the above common options, these options
are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>

Use the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> option to have <CODE>rtag</CODE> look in the
<TT>`Attic'</TT> (see section <A HREF="cvs_12.html#SEC62">Removing files from a module</A>) for removed files
that contain the specified tag.  The tag is removed from
these files, which makes it convenient to re-use a

removed from the up-coming distribution).

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD>
Make the tag a branch tag.  See section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC50">Branches</A>.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete the tag instead of creating it.

In general, tags (often the symbolic names of software
distributions) should not be removed, but the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP>
option is available as a means to remove completely
obsolete symbolic names if necessary (as might be the
case for an Alpha release, or if you mistagged a

</UL>

<P>
Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest
repository versions to your working sources.  The tags
are applied immediately to the repository, as with
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, but the versions are supplied implicitly by the
CVS records of your working files' history rather than
applied explicitly.

</P>
<P>
One use for tags is to record a snapshot of the
current sources when the software freeze date of a
project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze
date, only those changed sources that are to be part of
the release need be re-tagged.

</P>
<P>
The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which
revisions of which files were used in creating a
software distribution.  The <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands allow you to extract an exact
copy of a tagged release at any time in the future,
regardless of whether files have been changed, added,
or removed since the release was tagged.

</P>
<P>
This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag,
or to create a branch.  See the options section below.

Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

<P>
Two special options are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD>
The -b option makes the tag a branch tag
(see section <A HREF="cvs_8.html#SEC50">Branches</A>), allowing concurrent, isolated
development.  This is most useful for creating a patch
to a previously released software distribution.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
The -c option checks that all files which are to be tagged are
unmodified.  This can be used to make sure that you can reconstruct the
current file contents.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete a tag.

If you use <SAMP>`cvs tag -d symbolic_tag'</SAMP>, the symbolic
tag you specify is deleted instead of being added.
Warning: Be very certain of your ground before you
delete a tag; doing this permanently discards some
historical information, which may later turn out to
be valuable.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Create any directories that exist in the repository if
they're missing from the working directory.  Normally,
<CODE>update</CODE> acts only on directories and files that
were already enrolled in your working directory.  

This is useful for updating directories that were
created in the repository since the initial checkout;
but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you
deliberately avoided certain directories in the
repository when you created your working directory
(either through use of a module name or by listing
explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the
command line), then updating with <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> will create
those directories, which may not be what you want.

<DT><CODE>-I <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Ignore files whose names match <VAR>name</VAR> (in your
working directory) during the update.  You can specify
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> more than once on the command line to specify
several files to ignore.  Use <SAMP>`-I !'</SAMP> to avoid
ignoring any files at all.  See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>, for other
ways to make CVS ignore some files.

<DT><CODE>-W<VAR>spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered during
update.  You can use this option repeatedly.

<VAR>spec</VAR> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT>
file. See section <A HREF="cvs_21.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

<DT><CODE>-j<VAR>revision</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
With two <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option to
the revision specified with the second <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> option,
into the working directory.

With one <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option.

In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<SAMP>`-j<VAR>Symbolic_Tag</VAR>:<VAR>Date_Specifier</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>U <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file was brought up to date with respect to the
repository.  This is done for any file that exists in
the repository but not in your source, and for files
that you haven't changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.

<DT><CODE>A <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, and will be added to the source repository
when you run <CODE>commit</CODE> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<DT><CODE>R <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, and will be removed from the source repository
when you run <CODE>commit</CODE> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<DT><CODE>M <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

<SAMP>`M'</SAMP> can indicate one of two states for a file
you're working on: either there were no modifications
to the same file in the repository, so that your file
remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications
in the repository as well as in your copy, but they
were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
working directory.

CVS will print some messages if it merges your work,
and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked
before you ran <CODE>update</CODE>) will be made.  The exact
name of that file is printed while <CODE>update</CODE> runs.

<DT><CODE>C <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX356"></A>
<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to <VAR>file</VAR> with changes from the source
repository.  <VAR>file</VAR> (the copy in your working
directory) is now the output of the rcsmerge(1) command
on the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file
is also in your working directory, with the name
<TT>`.#<VAR>file</VAR>.<VAR>revision</VAR>'</TT> where <VAR>revision</VAR>
is the RCS revision that your modified file started
from.  Resolve the conflict as described in
section <A HREF="cvs_7.html#SEC40">Conflicts example</A>
(Note that some systems automatically purge
files that begin with <TT>`.#'</TT> if they have not been
accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
it.)  Under VMS, the file name starts with
<TT>`__'</TT> rather than <TT>`.#'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>? <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<VAR>file</VAR> is in your working directory, but does not
