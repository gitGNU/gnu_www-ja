<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>

</P>
<P>
Up to this point, one of the weakest parts of CVS
has been the documentation.  CVS is a complex
program.  Previous versions of the manual were written
in the manual page format, which is not really well
suited for such a complex program.

</P>
<P>
When writing this manual, I had several goals in mind:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

No knowledge of RCS should be necessary.

<LI>

No previous knowledge of revision control software
should be necessary.  All terms, such as <EM>revision
numbers</EM>, <EM>revision trees</EM> and <EM>merging</EM> are
explained as they are introduced.

<LI>

The manual should concentrate on the things CVS users
want to do, instead of what the CVS commands can do.
The first part of this manual leads you through things
you might want to do while doing development, and
introduces the relevant CVS commands as they are
needed.

<LI>

Information should be easy to find.  In the reference
manual in the appendices almost all information about
every CVS command is gathered together.  There is also
an extensive index, and a lot of cross references.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC2">Checklist for the impatient reader</A></H2>

<P>
CVS is a complex system.  You will need to read
the manual to be able to use all of its capabilities.
There are dangers that can easily be avoided if you
know about them, and this manual tries to warn you
about them.  This checklist is intended to help you
avoid the dangers without reading the entire manual.
If you intend to read the entire manual you can skip
this table.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Binary files
<DD>
CVS can handle binary files, but
you must have RCS release 5.5 or later and
a release of GNU diff that supports the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP>
flag (release 1.15 and later are OK).  You must also
configure both RCS and CVS to handle binary
files when you install them.

Keword substitution can be a source of trouble with
binary files. See section <A HREF="cvs_17.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>, for
solutions.

<DT>The <CODE>admin</CODE> command
<DD>
Careless use of the <CODE>admin</CODE> command can cause
CVS to cease working.  See section <A HREF="cvs_20.html#SEC91">admin--Administration front end for rcs</A>, before trying
to use it.

Roland Pesch, Cygnus Support &#60;<TT>pesch@cygnus.com</TT>&#62;
wrote the manual pages which were distributed with
CVS 1.3.  Appendix A and B contain much text that
was extracted from them.  He also read an early draft
of this manual and contributed many ideas and
corrections.

</P>
<P>
The mailing-list <CODE>info-cvs</CODE> is sometimes
informative. I have included information from postings
made by the following persons:
David G. Grubbs &#60;<TT>dgg@think.com</TT>&#62;.

</P>
<P>
Some text has been extracted from the man pages for
RCS.

</P>
<P>
The CVS FAQ by David G. Grubbs has provided
useful material.  The FAQ is no longer maintained,
however, and this manual about the closest thing there
is to a successor (with respect to documenting how to
use CVS, at least).

</P>
<P>
In addition, the following persons have helped by
telling me about mistakes I've made:
Roxanne Brunskill &#60;<TT>rbrunski@datap.ca</TT>&#62;,
Kathy Dyer &#60;<TT>dyer@phoenix.ocf.llnl.gov</TT>&#62;,
Karl Pingle &#60;<TT>pingle@acuson.com</TT>&#62;,
Thomas A Peterson &#60;<TT>tap@src.honeywell.com</TT>&#62;,

<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC4">BUGS</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
This manual is known to have room for improvement.
Here is a list of known deficiencies:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In the examples, the output from CVS is sometimes
displayed, sometimes not.

<LI>

The input that you are supposed to type in the examples
should have a different font than the output from the
computer.

<LI>

This manual should be clearer about what file
permissions you should set up in the repository, and
about setuid/setgid.

<LI>

Some of the chapters are not yet complete.  They are
noted by comments in the <TT>`cvs.texinfo'</TT> file.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
This list is not complete.  If you notice any error,
omission, or something that is unclear, please send
mail to <TT>bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu</TT>.
</UL>

<P>
I hope that you will find this manual useful, despite
the above-mentioned shortcomings.
