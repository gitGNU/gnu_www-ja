<H2><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC69">Moving the history file</A></H2>

<P>
This method is more dangerous, since it involves moving
files inside the repository.  Read this entire section
before trying it out!

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ mv <VAR>old</VAR>,v <VAR>new</VAR>,v
</PRE>

<P>
Advantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The log of changes is maintained intact.

<LI>

The revision numbers are not affected.
</UL>

<P>
Disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Old releases of the module cannot easily be fetched from the
repository.  (The file will show up as <VAR>new</VAR> even
in revisions from the time before it was renamed).

<LI>

There is no log information of when the file was renamed.

<LI>

Nasty things might happen if someone accesses the history file
while you are moving it.  Make sure no one else runs any of the CVS
commands while you move it.
