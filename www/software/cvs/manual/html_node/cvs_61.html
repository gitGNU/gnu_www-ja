If you modify a program to better fit your site, you
probably want to include your modifications when the next
release of the program arrives.  CVS can help you with
this task.

In the terminology used in CVS, the supplier of the
program is called a <EM>vendor</EM>.  The unmodified
distribution from the vendor is checked in on its own
branch, the <EM>vendor branch</EM>.  CVS reserves branch
1.1.1 for this use.

</P>
<P>
When you modify the source and commit it, your revision
will end up on the main trunk.  When a new release is
made by the vendor, you commit it on the vendor branch
and copy the modifications onto the main trunk.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>import</CODE> command to create and update
the vendor branch.  After a successful <CODE>import</CODE>
the vendor branch is made the `head' revision, so
anyone that checks out a copy of the file gets that
revision.  When a local modification is committed it is
placed on the main trunk, and made the `head'
revision.
