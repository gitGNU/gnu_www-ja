When you want to update or merge a file, use the <CODE>update</CODE>
command.  For files that are not up to date this is roughly equivalent
to a <CODE>checkout</CODE> command: the newest revision of the file is
extracted from the repository and put in your working copy of the
module.

</P>
<P>
Your modifications to a file are never lost when you
use <CODE>update</CODE>.  If no newer revision exists,
running <CODE>update</CODE> has no effect.  If you have
edited the file, and a newer revision is available,
CVS will merge all changes into your working copy.

</P>
<P>
For instance, imagine that you checked out revision 1.4 and started
editing it.  In the meantime someone else committed revision 1.5, and
shortly after that revision 1.6.  If you run <CODE>update</CODE> on the file
now, CVS will incorporate all changes between revision 1.4 and 1.6 into
your file.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
If any of the changes between 1.4 and 1.6 were made too
close to any of the changes you have made, an
<EM>overlap</EM> occurs.  In such cases a warning is
printed, and the resulting file includes both
versions of the lines that overlap, delimited by
special markers.
See section <A HREF="cvs_125.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>, for a complete description of the
<CODE>update</CODE> command.
