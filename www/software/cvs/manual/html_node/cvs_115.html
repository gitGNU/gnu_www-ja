Requires: Working directory.

Changes: Working directory, history log.

<P>
This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
<SAMP>`cvs checkout'</SAMP>.  Since CVS doesn't lock files, it
isn't strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have
forgotten, and you leave no trace in the CVS history
file (see section <A HREF="cvs_142.html#SEC149">The history file</A>) that you've abandoned your
checkout.

</P>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`cvs release'</SAMP> to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a CVS working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

</P>
<P>
If all these conditions are true, <SAMP>`cvs release'</SAMP>
leaves a record of its execution (attesting to your
intentionally abandoning your checkout) in the CVS
history log.
