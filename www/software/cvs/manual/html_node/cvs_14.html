The CVS <EM>repository</EM> stores a complete copy of
all the files and directories which are under version
control.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you never access any of the files in the
repository directly.  Instead, you use CVS
commands to get your own copy of the files, and then
work on that copy.  When you've finished a set of
changes, you check (or <EM>commit</EM>) them back into the
repository.  The repository then contains the changes
which you have made, as well as recording exactly what
you changed, when you changed it, and other such
information.

CVS can access a repository by a variety of
means.  It might be on the local computer, or it might
be on a computer across the room or across the world.
To distinguish various ways to access a repository, the
repository name can start with an <EM>access method</EM>.
For example, the access method <CODE>:local:</CODE> means to
access a repository directory, so the repository
<CODE>:local:/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE> means that the
repository is in <TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT> on the
computer running CVS.  For information on other
access methods, see section <A HREF="cvs_22.html#SEC24">Remote repositories</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the access method is omitted, then if the repository
does not contain <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>, then <CODE>:local:</CODE> is
assumed.  If it does contain <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> than either
<CODE>:ext:</CODE> or <CODE>:server:</CODE> is assumed.  For
example, if you have a local repository in
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT>, you can use
<CODE>/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE> instead of
<CODE>:local:/usr/local/cvsroot</CODE>.  But if (under
Windows NT, for example) your local repository is
<TT>`c:\src\cvsroot'</TT>, then you must specify the access
method, as in <CODE>:local:c:\src\cvsroot</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The repository is split in two parts.  <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> contains
administrative files for CVS.  The other directories contain the actual
user-defined modules.
