<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC2">Checklist for the impatient reader</A></H2>

<P>
CVS is a complex system.  You will need to read
the manual to be able to use all of its capabilities.
There are dangers that can easily be avoided if you
know about them, and this manual tries to warn you
about them.  This checklist is intended to help you
avoid the dangers without reading the entire manual.
If you intend to read the entire manual you can skip
this table.

<DT>Binary files
<DD>
CVS can handle binary files, but
you must have RCS release 5.5 or later and
a release of GNU diff that supports the <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP>
flag (release 1.15 and later are OK).  You must also
configure both RCS and CVS to handle binary
files when you install them.

Keword substitution can be a source of trouble with
binary files. See section <A HREF="cvs_75.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>, for
solutions.

<DT>The <CODE>admin</CODE> command
<DD>
Careless use of the <CODE>admin</CODE> command can cause
CVS to cease working.  See section <A HREF="cvs_89.html#SEC91">admin--Administration front end for rcs</A>, before trying
to use it.
