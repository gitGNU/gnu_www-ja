<P>

This manual is known to have room for improvement.
Here is a list of known deficiencies:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In the examples, the output from CVS is sometimes
displayed, sometimes not.

<LI>

The input that you are supposed to type in the examples
should have a different font than the output from the
computer.

<LI>

This manual should be clearer about what file
permissions you should set up in the repository, and
about setuid/setgid.

<LI>

Some of the chapters are not yet complete.  They are
noted by comments in the <TT>`cvs.texinfo'</TT> file.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
This list is not complete.  If you notice any error,
omission, or something that is unclear, please send
mail to <TT>bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu</TT>.
</UL>

<P>
I hope that you will find this manual useful, despite
the above-mentioned shortcomings.
