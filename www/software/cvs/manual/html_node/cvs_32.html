<P>
If you have a project which you are maintaining with
another version control system, such as RCS, you
may wish to put the files from that project into
CVS, and preserve the revision history of the
files.

<DT>From RCS
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
 
If you have been using RCS, find the RCS
files--usually a file named <TT>`foo.c'</TT> will have its
RCS file in <TT>`RCS/foo.c,v'</TT> (but it could be
other places; consult the RCS documentation for
details).  Then create the appropriate directories in
CVS if they do not already exist.  Then copy the
files into the appropriate directories in the CVS
repository (the name in the repository must be the name
of the source file with <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP> added; the files go
directly in the appopriate directory of the repository,
not in an <TT>`RCS'</TT> subdirectory).  This is one of the
few times when it is a good idea to access the CVS
repository directly, rather than using CVS
commands.  Then you are ready to check out a new
working directory.

The RCS file should not be locked when you move it
into CVS; if it is, CVS will have trouble
letting you operate on it.

<DT>From another version control system
<DD>
Many version control systems have the ability to export
RCS files in the standard format.  If yours does,
export the RCS files and then follow the above
instructions.

<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<DT>From SCCS
<DD>
There is a script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT> directory of
the CVS source distribution called <TT>`sccs2rcs'</TT>
which converts SCCS files to RCS files.
Note: you must run it on a machine which has both
SCCS and RCS installed, and like everything
else in contrib it is unsupported (your mileage may
vary).
