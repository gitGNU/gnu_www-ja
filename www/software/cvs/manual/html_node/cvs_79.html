<P>
Each file has a stored default substitution mode, and
each working directory copy of a file also has a
substitution mode.  The former is set by the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>
option to <CODE>cvs add</CODE> and <CODE>cvs admin</CODE>; the
latter is set by the -k or -A options to <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> or <CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  <CODE>cvs diff</CODE> also
has a <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option.  For some examples,
See section <A HREF="cvs_81.html#SEC83">Handling binary files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The modes available are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`-kkv'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate keyword strings using the default form, e.g.
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $ for the <CODE>Revision</CODE>
keyword.

<DT><SAMP>`-kkvl'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-kkv'</SAMP>, except that a locker's name is always
inserted if the given revision is currently locked.
This option is normally not useful when CVS is used.

<DT><SAMP>`-kk'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit
their values.  For example, for the <CODE>Revision</CODE>
keyword, generate the string <CODE>$</CODE>Revision$
instead of <CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $.  This option
is useful to ignore differences due to keyword
substitution when comparing different revisions of a
file.

<DT><SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate the old keyword string, present in the working
file just before it was checked in.  For example, for
the <CODE>Revision</CODE> keyword, generate the string
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 1.1 $ instead of
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $ if that is how the
string appeared when the file was checked in.

<DT><SAMP>`-kb'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>, but also inhibit conversion of line
endings between the canonical form in which they are
stored in the repository (linefeed only), and the form
appropriate to the operating system in use on the
client.  For systems, like unix, which use linefeed
only to terminate lines, this is the same as
<SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>.  For more information on binary files, see
section <A HREF="cvs_81.html#SEC83">Handling binary files</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.  For
example, for the <CODE>Revision</CODE> keyword, generate the string
<CODE>5.7</CODE> instead of <CODE>$</CODE>Revision: 5.7 $.
This can help generate files in programming languages
where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters like
<CODE>$</CODE>Revision: $ from a string.  However,
further keyword substitution cannot be performed once
the keyword names are removed, so this option should be
used with care.

One often would like to use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP> with <CODE>cvs
export</CODE>---see section <A HREF="cvs_101.html#SEC108">export--Export sources from CVS, similar to checkout</A>.  But be aware that doesn't
handle an export containing binary files correctly.
