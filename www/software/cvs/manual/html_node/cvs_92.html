Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...
<LI>

Requires: repository.
<LI>

Changes: working directory.
<LI>

Synonyms: co, get
</UL>

<P>
Make a working directory containing copies of the
source files specified by <VAR>modules</VAR>.  You must execute
<CODE>checkout</CODE> before using most of the other CVS
commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>modules</VAR> part of the command are either
symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic
names are defined in the <SAMP>`modules'</SAMP> file.
See section <A HREF="cvs_130.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>.

</P>
<P>
Depending on the modules you specify, <CODE>checkout</CODE> may
recursively create directories and populate them with
the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these
source files at any time (regardless of whether other
software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by
others to the source repository; or commit your work as
a permanent change to the source repository.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>checkout</CODE> is used to create
directories.  The top-level directory created is always
added to the directory where <CODE>checkout</CODE> is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified
module.  In the case of a module alias, the created
sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
<CODE>checkout</CODE> will show the relative path leading to
each file as it is extracted into your private work
area (unless you specify the <SAMP>`-Q'</SAMP> global option).

</P>
<P>
The files created by <CODE>checkout</CODE> are created
read-write, unless the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option to CVS
(see section <A HREF="cvs_87.html#SEC89">Global options</A>) is specified, the
<CODE>CVSREAD</CODE> environment variable is specified
(see section <A HREF="cvs_144.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>), or a watch is in
effect for that file (see section <A HREF="cvs_41.html#SEC43">Mechanisms to track who is editing files</A>).

</P>
<P>
Running <CODE>checkout</CODE> on a directory that was already
built by a prior <CODE>checkout</CODE> is also permitted, and
has the same effect as specifying the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option
to the <CODE>update</CODE> command, that is, any new
directories that have been created in the repository
will appear in your work area.  See section <A HREF="cvs_125.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>.

</P>
<P>
For the output produced by the <CODE>checkout</CODE> command
see section <A HREF="cvs_127.html#SEC134">update output</A>.
