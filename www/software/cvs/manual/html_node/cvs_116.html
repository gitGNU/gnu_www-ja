<P>
The <CODE>release</CODE> command supports one command option:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete your working copy of the file if the release
succeeds.  If this flag is not given your files will
remain in your working directory.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG>  The <CODE>release</CODE> command deletes
all directories and files recursively.  This
has the very serious side-effect that any directory
that you have created inside your checked-out sources,
and not added to the repository (using the <CODE>add</CODE>
command; see section <A HREF="cvs_59.html#SEC61">Adding files to a directory</A>) will be silently deleted--even
if it is non-empty!
