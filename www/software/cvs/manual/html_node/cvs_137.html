<P>
The <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file is used to control where
<SAMP>`cvs commit'</SAMP> log information is sent.  The first
entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>.  If a match is found, then
the remainder of the line is a filter program that
should expect log information on its standard input.

</P>
<P>
The filter program may use one and only one % modifier
(a la printf).  If <SAMP>`%s'</SAMP> is specified in the filter
program, a brief title is included (enclosed in single
quotes) showing the modified file names.

</P>
<P>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first
matching regular expression or <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The first matching regular expression is used.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="cvs_132.html#SEC139">The commit support files</A>, for a description of the syntax of
the <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file.  

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
<TT>`loginfo'</TT> will be run on the <EM>remote</EM>
(i.e., server) side, not the client side (see section <A HREF="cvs_22.html#SEC24">Remote repositories</A>).
