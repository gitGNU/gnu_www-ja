In some situations it is a good idea to have more than
one repository, for instance if you have two
development groups that work on separate projects
without sharing any code.  All you have to do to have
several repositories is to specify the appropriate
repository, using the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment
variable, the <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option to CVS, or (once
you have checked out a working directory) by simply
allowing CVS to use the repository that was used
to check out the working directory
(see section <A HREF="cvs_15.html#SEC16">Telling CVS where your repository is</A>).

The big advantage of having multiple repositories is
that they can reside on different servers.  The big
disadvantage is that you cannot have a single CVS
command recurse into directories which comes from
different repositories.  Generally speaking, if you are
thinking of setting up several repositories on the same
machine, you might want to consider using several
directories within the same repository.

None of the examples in this manual show multiple
repositories.
