<P>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
Since a file which is being watched is checked out
read-only, you cannot simply edit it.  To make it
read-write, and inform others that you are planning to
edit it, use the <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command.  Some systems
call this a <EM>checkout</EM>, but CVS uses that term
for obtaining a copy of the sources (see section <A HREF="cvs_10.html#SEC11">Getting the source</A>), an operation which those systems call a
<EM>get</EM> or a <EM>fetch</EM>.

<DD><A NAME="IDX183"></A>

</P>
<P>
Prepare to edit the working files <VAR>files</VAR>.  CVS makes the
<VAR>files</VAR> read-write, and notifies users who have requested
<CODE>edit</CODE> notification for any of <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>cvs edit</CODE> command accepts the same <VAR>options</VAR> as the
<CODE>cvs watch add</CODE> command, and establishes a temporary watch for the
user on <VAR>files</VAR>; CVS will remove the watch when <VAR>files</VAR> are
<CODE>unedit</CODE>ed or <CODE>commit</CODE>ted.  If the user does not wish to
receive notifications, she should specify <CODE>-a none</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>files</VAR> and <CODE>-l</CODE> option are processed as for the <CODE>cvs
watch</CODE> commands.

</P>
</DL>

<P>
Normally when you are done with a set of changes, you
use the <CODE>cvs commit</CODE> command, which checks in your
changes and returns the watched files to their usual
read-only state.  But if you instead decide to abandon
your changes, or not to make any changes, you can use
the <CODE>cvs unedit</CODE> command.

<DD><A NAME="IDX187"></A>

</P>
<P>
Abandon work on the working files <VAR>files</VAR>, and revert them to the
repository versions on which they are based.  CVS makes those
<VAR>files</VAR> read-only for which users have requested notification using
<CODE>cvs watch on</CODE>.  CVS notifies users who have requested <CODE>unedit</CODE>
notification for any of <VAR>files</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>files</VAR> and <CODE>-l</CODE> option are processed as for the
<CODE>cvs watch</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
If watches are not in use, the <CODE>unedit</CODE> command
probably does not work, and the way to revert to the
repository version is to remove the file and then use
<CODE>cvs update</CODE> to get a new copy.  The meaning is
not precisely the same; removing and updating may also
bring in some changes which have been made in the
repository since the last time you updated.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
When using client/server CVS, you can use the
<CODE>cvs edit</CODE> and <CODE>cvs unedit</CODE> commands even if
CVS is unable to succesfully communicate with the
server; the notifications will be sent upon the next
successful CVS command.
