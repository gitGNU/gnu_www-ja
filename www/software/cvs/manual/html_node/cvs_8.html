A file can have several versions, as described above.
Likewise, a software product can have several versions.
A software product is often given a version number such
as <SAMP>`4.1.1'</SAMP>.

<P>
Versions in the first sense are called <EM>revisions</EM>
in this document, and versions in the second sense are
called <EM>releases</EM>.  To avoid confusion, the word
<EM>version</EM> is almost never used in this document.
