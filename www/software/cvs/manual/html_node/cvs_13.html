You do not remember modifying <TT>`driver.c'</TT>, so you want to see what
has happened to that file.

<PRE>
$ cd tc
$ cvs diff driver.c

<P>
This command runs <CODE>diff</CODE> to compare the version of <TT>`driver.c'</TT>
that you checked out with your working copy.  When you see the output
you remember that you added a command line option that enabled the
optimization pass.  You check it in, and release the module.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs commit -m "Added an optimization pass" driver.c
Checking in driver.c;
