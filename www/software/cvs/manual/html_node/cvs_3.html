Roland Pesch, Cygnus Support &#60;<TT>pesch@cygnus.com</TT>&#62;
wrote the manual pages which were distributed with
CVS 1.3.  Appendix A and B contain much text that
was extracted from them.  He also read an early draft
of this manual and contributed many ideas and
corrections.

</P>
<P>
The mailing-list <CODE>info-cvs</CODE> is sometimes
informative. I have included information from postings
made by the following persons:
David G. Grubbs &#60;<TT>dgg@think.com</TT>&#62;.

</P>
<P>
Some text has been extracted from the man pages for
RCS.

</P>
<P>
The CVS FAQ by David G. Grubbs has provided
useful material.  The FAQ is no longer maintained,
however, and this manual about the closest thing there
is to a successor (with respect to documenting how to
use CVS, at least).

</P>
<P>
In addition, the following persons have helped by
telling me about mistakes I've made:
Roxanne Brunskill &#60;<TT>rbrunski@datap.ca</TT>&#62;,
Kathy Dyer &#60;<TT>dyer@phoenix.ocf.llnl.gov</TT>&#62;,
Karl Pingle &#60;<TT>pingle@acuson.com</TT>&#62;,
