<H3><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC92">admin options</A></H3>

<P>
Not all valid <CODE>rcs</CODE> options are useful together
with CVS.  Some even makes it impossible to use
CVS until you undo the effect!

</P>
<P>
This description of the available options is based on
the <SAMP>`rcs(1)'</SAMP> man page, but modified to suit
readers that are more interrested in CVS than
RCS.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>oldfile</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
access list of <VAR>oldfile</VAR> to the access list of the
RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-a<VAR>logins</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Append the
login names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> to the access list of the RCS file.

<DT><CODE>-b[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
When used with bare RCS, this
option sets the default branch to <VAR>rev</VAR>; in
CVS sticky tags (see section <A HREF="cvs_52.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>) are a better
way to decide which branch you want to work on.  With
CVS, this option can be used to control behavior
with respect to the vendor branch.

<DT><CODE>-c<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Sets the comment leader to
<VAR>string</VAR>.  The comment leader is printed before
every log message line generated by the keyword
<CODE>$</CODE>Log$ (see section <A HREF="cvs_75.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>).
This is useful for programming languages without
multi-line comments.  RCS initially guesses the
value of the comment leader from the file name
extension when the file is first committed.

<DT><CODE>-e[<VAR>logins</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Might not work together with CVS.  Erase the login
names appearing in the comma-separated list
<VAR>logins</VAR> from the access list of the RCS file.  If
<VAR>logins</VAR> is omitted, erase the entire access list.

<DT><CODE>-I</CODE>
<DD>
Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a
terminal.

<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS.  When using bare RCS, this
is used to create and initialize a new RCS file,
without depositing a revision.

<DT><CODE>-k<VAR>subst</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the default keyword
substitution to <VAR>subst</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="cvs_75.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>.  Giving an explicit <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option to
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>, <CODE>cvs export</CODE>, or <CODE>cvs
checkout</CODE> overrides this default.

<DT><CODE>-l[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the revision with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch
is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If
<VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, lock the latest revision on the
default branch.

This can be used in conjunction with the
<TT>`rcslock.pl'</TT> script in the <TT>`contrib'</TT>
directory of the CVS source distribution to
provide reserved checkouts (where only one user can be
editing a given file at a time).  See the comments in
that file for details (and see the <TT>`README'</TT> file
in that directory for disclaimers about the unsupported
nature of contrib).  According to comments in that
file, locking must set to strict (which is the default).

<DT><CODE>-L</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the
owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option above.

<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<A NAME="IDX332"></A>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>rev</VAR>:<VAR>msg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Replace the log message of revision <VAR>rev</VAR> with
<VAR>msg</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-N<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Act like <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, except override any previous
assignment of <VAR>name</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-n<VAR>name</VAR>[:[<VAR>rev</VAR>]]</CODE>
<DD>
Associate the symbolic name <VAR>name</VAR> with the branch
or revision <VAR>rev</VAR>.  It is normally better to use
<SAMP>`cvs tag'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cvs rtag'</SAMP> instead.  Delete the
symbolic name if both <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> and <VAR>rev</VAR> are
omitted; otherwise, print an error message if
<VAR>name</VAR> is already associated with another number.
If <VAR>rev</VAR> is symbolic, it is expanded before
association.  A <VAR>rev</VAR> consisting of a branch number
followed by a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> stands for the current latest
revision in the branch.  A <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> with an empty
<VAR>rev</VAR> stands for the current latest revision on the
default branch, normally the trunk.  For example,
<SAMP>`rcs -n<VAR>name</VAR>: RCS/*'</SAMP> associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the
current latest revision of all the named RCS files;
this contrasts with <SAMP>`rcs -n<VAR>name</VAR>:$ RCS/*'</SAMP> which
associates <VAR>name</VAR> with the revision numbers
extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding
working files.

<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o<VAR>range</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Potentially useful, but dangerous, with CVS (see below).
Deletes (<EM>outdates</EM>) the revisions given by
<VAR>range</VAR>.  A range consisting of a single revision
number means that revision.  A range consisting of a
branch number means the latest revision on that branch.
A range of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>rev1</VAR>:<VAR>rev2</VAR>'</SAMP> means
revisions <VAR>rev1</VAR> to <VAR>rev2</VAR> on the same branch,
<SAMP>`:<VAR>rev</VAR>'</SAMP> means from the beginning of the
branch containing <VAR>rev</VAR> up to and including
<VAR>rev</VAR>, and <SAMP>`<VAR>rev</VAR>:'</SAMP> means from revision
<VAR>rev</VAR> to the end of the branch containing
<VAR>rev</VAR>.  None of the outdated revisions may have
branches or locks.

Due to the way CVS handles branches <VAR>rev</VAR>
cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.
See section <A HREF="cvs_146.html#SEC153">Magic branch numbers</A>, for an explanation.

Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For
this reason, this option is not a good way to take back
a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
change instead (see section <A HREF="cvs_56.html#SEC58">Merging differences between any two revisions</A>).

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

<DT><CODE>-s<VAR>state</VAR>[:<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Set the state attribute of the
revision <VAR>rev</VAR> to <VAR>state</VAR>.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is a
branch number, assume the latest revision on that
branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is omitted, assume the latest
revision on the default branch.  Any identifier is
acceptable for <VAR>state</VAR>.  A useful set of states is
<SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> (for experimental), <SAMP>`Stab'</SAMP> (for
stable), and <SAMP>`Rel'</SAMP> (for released).  By default,
the state of a new revision is set to <SAMP>`Exp'</SAMP> when
it is created.  The state is visible in the output from
<VAR>cvs log</VAR> (see section <A HREF="cvs_109.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>), and in the
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Log$ and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>State$ keywords
(see section <A HREF="cvs_75.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>).  Note that CVS
uses the <CODE>dead</CODE> state for its own purposes; to
take a file to or from the <CODE>dead</CODE> state use
commands like <CODE>cvs remove</CODE> and <CODE>cvs add</CODE>, not
<CODE>cvs admin -s</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-t[<VAR>file</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Useful with CVS.  Write descriptive text from the
contents of the named <VAR>file</VAR> into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.  The <VAR>file</VAR> pathname
may not begin with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  If <VAR>file</VAR> is omitted,
obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> by itself.
Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.  The descriptive text can be seen in the
output from <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="cvs_109.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>).

<DT><CODE>-t-<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Similar to <SAMP>`-t<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>. Write descriptive text
from the <VAR>string</VAR> into the RCS file, deleting
the existing text.

<DT><CODE>-U</CODE>
<DD>
Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means
that the owner of a file need not lock a revision for
checkin.  For use with CVS, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option
above.

<DT><CODE>-u[<VAR>rev</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
See the option <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> above, for a discussion of
using this option with CVS.  Unlock the revision
with number <VAR>rev</VAR>.  If a branch is given, unlock
the latest revision on that branch.  If <VAR>rev</VAR> is
omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock it.
Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock.
This causes a mail message to be sent to the original
locker.  The message contains a commentary solicited
from the breaker.  The commentary is terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <CODE>.</CODE> by itself.

<DT><CODE>-V<VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Emulate RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>. Use -V<VAR>n</VAR> to make
an RCS file acceptable to RCS version <VAR>n</VAR>
by discarding information that would confuse version
<VAR>n</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-x<VAR>suffixes</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Useless with CVS. Use <VAR>suffixes</VAR> to
characterize RCS files.
