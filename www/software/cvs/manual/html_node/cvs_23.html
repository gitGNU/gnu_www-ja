CVS uses the <TT>`rsh'</TT> protocol to perform these
operations, so the remote user host needs to have a
<TT>`.rhosts'</TT> file which grants access to the local
user.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you are the user <TT>`mozart'</TT> on
the local machine <TT>`anklet.grunge.com'</TT>, and the
server machine is <TT>`chainsaw.brickyard.com'</TT>.  On
chainsaw, put the following line into the file
<TT>`.rhosts'</TT> in <TT>`bach'</TT>'s home directory:

</P>

<PRE>
anklet.grunge.com  mozart
</PRE>

<P>
Then test that <CODE>rsh</CODE> is working with

</P>

<PRE>
rsh -l bach chainsaw.brickyard.com 'echo $PATH'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
Next you have to make sure that <CODE>rsh</CODE> will be able
to find the server.  Make sure that the path which
<CODE>rsh</CODE> printed in the above example includes the
directory containing a program named <CODE>cvs</CODE> which
is the server.  You need to set the path in
<TT>`.bashrc'</TT>, <TT>`.cshrc'</TT>, etc., not <TT>`.login'</TT>
or <TT>`.profile'</TT>.  Alternately, you can set the
environment variable <CODE>CVS_SERVER</CODE> on the client
machine to the filename of the server you want to use,
for example <TT>`/usr/local/bin/cvs-1.6'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
There is no need to edit <CODE>inetd.conf</CODE> or start a
CVS server daemon.

There are two access methods that you use in CVSROOT
for rsh.  <CODE>:server:</CODE> specifies an internal rsh
client, which is supported only by some CVS ports.
<CODE>:ext:</CODE> specifies an external rsh program.  By
default this is <CODE>rsh</CODE> but you may set the
<CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> environment variable to invoke another
program which can access the remote server (for
example, <CODE>remsh</CODE> on HP-UX 9 because <CODE>rsh</CODE> is
something different).  It must be a program which can
transmit data to and from the server without modifying
it; for example the Windows NT <CODE>rsh</CODE> is not
suitable since it by default translates between CRLF
and LF.  The OS/2 CVS port has a hack to pass <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP>
to <CODE>rsh</CODE> to get around this, but since this could
potentially cause programs for programs other than the
standard <CODE>rsh</CODE>, it may change in the future.  If
you set <CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> to <CODE>SSH</CODE> or some other rsh
replacement, the instructions in the rest of this
section concerning <TT>`.rhosts'</TT> and so on are likely
to be incorrect; consult the documentation for your rsh
replacement.

</P>
<P>
Continuing our example, supposing you want to access
the module <TT>`foo'</TT> in the repository
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot/'</TT>, on machine
<TT>`chainsaw.brickyard.com'</TT>, you are ready to go:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs -d :ext:bach@chainsaw.brickyard.com:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout foo
</PRE>

<P>
(The <TT>`bach@'</TT> can be omitted if the username is
the same on both the local and remote hosts.)
