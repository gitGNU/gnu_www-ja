Synopsis: export [-flNn] [-r rev|-D date] [-k subst] [-d dir] module...
<LI>

Requires: repository.
<LI>

Changes: current directory.
</UL>

<P>
This command is a variant of <CODE>checkout</CODE>; use it
when you want a copy of the source for module without
the CVS administrative directories.  For example, you
might use <CODE>export</CODE> to prepare source for shipment
off-site.  This command requires that you specify a
date or tag (with <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>), so that you
can count on reproducing the source you ship to others.

</P>
<P>
One often would like to use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP> with <CODE>cvs
export</CODE>.  This causes any RCS keywords to be
expanded such that an import done at some other site
will not lose the keyword revision information.  But be
aware that doesn't handle an export containing binary
files correctly.  Also be aware that after having used
<SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>, one can no longer use the <CODE>ident</CODE>
command (which is part of the RCS suite--see
ident(1)) which looks for RCS keyword strings.  If
you want to be able to use <CODE>ident</CODE> you must not
use <SAMP>`-kv'</SAMP>.
