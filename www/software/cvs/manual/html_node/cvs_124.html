<H3><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC131">tag options</A></H3>

<P>
These standard options are supported by <CODE>tag</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="cvs_88.html#SEC90">Common command options</A>, for a complete description of
them):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-F</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite an existing tag of the same name on a
different revision.  This option is new in CVS
1.4.  The old behavior is matched by <SAMP>`cvs tag -F'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.
</DL>

<P>
Two special options are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b</CODE>
<DD>
The -b option makes the tag a branch tag
(see section <A HREF="cvs_48.html#SEC50">Branches</A>), allowing concurrent, isolated
development.  This is most useful for creating a patch
to a previously released software distribution.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
The -c option checks that all files which are to be tagged are
unmodified.  This can be used to make sure that you can reconstruct the
current file contents.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
Delete a tag.

If you use <SAMP>`cvs tag -d symbolic_tag'</SAMP>, the symbolic
tag you specify is deleted instead of being added.
Warning: Be very certain of your ground before you
delete a tag; doing this permanently discards some
historical information, which may later turn out to
be valuable.
