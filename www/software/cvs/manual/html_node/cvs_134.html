<P>
The <TT>`commitinfo'</TT> file defines programs to execute
whenever <SAMP>`cvs commit'</SAMP> is about to execute.  These
programs are used for pre-commit checking to verify
that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for
instance, to verify that the changed files conform to
to your site's standards for coding practice.

</P>
<P>
As mentioned earlier, each line in the
<TT>`commitinfo'</TT> file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template can include
a program name and any number of arguments you wish to
supply to it.  The full path to the current source
repository is appended to the template, followed by the
file names of any files involved in the commit (added,
removed, and modified files).

</P>
<P>
The first line with a regular expression matching the
relative path to the module will be used.  If the
command returns a non-zero exit status the commit will
be aborted.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX382"></A>
All occurances of the name <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP> appearing as a
regular expression are used in addition to the first
matching regular expression or the name <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
<TT>`commitinfo'</TT> will be run on the <EM>remote</EM>
(i.e., server) side, not the client side (see section <A HREF="cvs_22.html#SEC24">Remote repositories</A>).
