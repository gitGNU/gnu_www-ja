<H2><A NAME="SEC137" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC137">The modules file</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
<A NAME="IDX363"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file records your definitions of
names for collections of source code.  CVS will
use these definitions if you use CVS to update the
modules file (use normal commands like <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, etc).

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file may contain blank lines and
comments (lines beginning with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>) as well as
module definitions.  Long lines can be continued on the
next line by specifying a backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>) as the
last character on the line.

</P>
<P>
A module definition is a single line of the
<TT>`modules'</TT> file, in either of two formats.  In both
cases, <VAR>mname</VAR> represents the symbolic module name,
and the remainder of the line is its definition.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>mname</VAR> -a <VAR>aliases</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
This represents the simplest way of defining a module
<VAR>mname</VAR>.  The <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> flags the definition as a
simple alias: CVS will treat any use of <VAR>mname</VAR> (as
a command argument) as if the list of names
<VAR>aliases</VAR> had been specified instead.
<VAR>aliases</VAR> may contain either other module names or
paths.  When you use paths in aliases, <CODE>checkout</CODE>
creates all intermediate directories in the working
directory, just as if the path had been specified
explicitly in the CVS arguments.

<DT><CODE><VAR>mname</VAR> [ options ] <VAR>dir</VAR> [ <VAR>files</VAR>... ] [ &#38;<VAR>module</VAR>... ]</CODE>
<DD>
In the simplest case, this form of module definition
reduces to <SAMP>`<VAR>mname</VAR> <VAR>dir</VAR>'</SAMP>.  This defines
all the files in directory <VAR>dir</VAR> as module mname.
<VAR>dir</VAR> is a relative path (from <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>) to a
directory of source in the source repository.  In this
case, on checkout, a single directory called
<VAR>mname</VAR> is created as a working directory; no
intermediate directory levels are used by default, even
if <VAR>dir</VAR> was a path involving several directory
levels.

By explicitly specifying files in the module definition
after <VAR>dir</VAR>, you can select particular files from
directory <VAR>dir</VAR>.  The sample definition for
<SAMP>`modules'</SAMP> is an example of a module defined with a
single file from a particular directory.  Here is
another example:


<PRE>
m4test  unsupported/gnu/m4 foreach.m4 forloop.m4
</PRE>

With this definition, executing <SAMP>`cvs checkout
m4test'</SAMP> will create a single working directory
<TT>`m4test'</TT> containing the two files listed, which
both come from a common directory several levels deep
in the CVS source repository.

A module definition can refer to other modules by
including <SAMP>`&#38;<VAR>module</VAR>'</SAMP> in its definition.
<CODE>checkout</CODE> creates a subdirectory for each such
module, in your working directory.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Name the working directory something other than the
module name.

<A NAME="IDX364"></A>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are exported.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs with a single
argument, the module name.

<A NAME="IDX365"></A>
<DT><CODE>-i <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are committed.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs with a single
argument, the full pathname of the affected directory
in a source repository.  The <TT>`commitinfo'</TT>,
<TT>`loginfo'</TT>, and <TT>`editinfo'</TT> files provide other
ways to call a program on commit.

<A NAME="IDX366"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are checked out.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs with a single
argument, the module name.

<A NAME="IDX367"></A>
<A NAME="IDX368"></A>
<DT><CODE>-s <VAR>status</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is
printed with <SAMP>`cvs checkout -s'</SAMP> the modules are
sorted according to primarily module status, and
secondarily according to the module name.  This option
has no other meaning.  You can use this option for
several things besides status: for instance, list the
person that is responsible for this module.

<A NAME="IDX369"></A>
<DT><CODE>-t <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever files in a
module are tagged with <CODE>rtag</CODE>.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs
with two arguments: the module name and the symbolic
tag specified to <CODE>rtag</CODE>.  There is no way to
specify a program to run when <CODE>tag</CODE> is executed.

<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>prog</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify a program <VAR>prog</VAR> to run whenever <SAMP>`cvs
update'</SAMP> is executed from the top-level directory of the
checked-out module.  <VAR>prog</VAR> runs with a single
argument, the full path to the source repository for
this module.
