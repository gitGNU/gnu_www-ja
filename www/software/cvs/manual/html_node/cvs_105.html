Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...
<LI>

Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
</UL>

<P>
Use <CODE>import</CODE> to incorporate an entire source
distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source
vendor) into your source repository directory.  You can
use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module
from the outside source.  See section <A HREF="cvs_61.html#SEC63">Tracking third-party sources</A>, for
a discussion on this subject.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>repository</VAR> argument gives a directory name
(or a path to a directory) under the CVS root directory
for repositories; if the directory did not exist,
import creates it.

</P>
<P>
When you use import for updates to source that has been
modified in your source repository (since a prior
import), it will notify you of any files that conflict
in the two branches of development; use <SAMP>`checkout
-j'</SAMP> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.

</P>
<P>
If CVS decides a file should be ignored
(see section <A HREF="cvs_141.html#SEC148">Ignoring files via cvsignore</A>), it does not import it and prints
<SAMP>`I '</SAMP> followed by the filename (see section <A HREF="cvs_107.html#SEC114">import output</A>, for a
complete description of the output).

</P>
<P>
If the file <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers'</TT> exists,
any file whose names match the specifications in that
file will be treated as packages and the appropriate
filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported, See section <A HREF="cvs_131.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.

</P>
<P>
The outside source is saved in a first-level RCS
branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
branch; for example, files from the first imported
collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision
1.1.1.2, and so on.

</P>
<P>
At least three arguments are required.
<VAR>repository</VAR> is needed to identify the collection
of source.  <VAR>vendortag</VAR> is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at
least one <VAR>releasetag</VAR> to identify the files at
the leaves created each time you execute <CODE>import</CODE>.
