<P>
Keyword substitution has its disadvantages.  Sometimes
you might want the literal text string
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Author$ to appear inside a file without
RCS interpreting it as a keyword and expanding it
into something like <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Author: ceder $.  

</P>
<P>
There is unfortunately no way to selectively turn off
keyword substitution.  You can use <SAMP>`-ko'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="cvs_79.html#SEC81">Substitution modes</A>) to turn off keyword
substitution entirely.

</P>
<P>
In many cases you can avoid using RCS keywords in
the source, even though they appear in the final
product.  For example, the source for this manual
contains <SAMP>`$@asis{}Author$'</SAMP> whenever the text
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>Author$ should appear.  In <CODE>nroff</CODE>
and <CODE>troff</CODE> you can embed the null-character
<CODE>\&#38;</CODE> inside the keyword for a similar effect.
