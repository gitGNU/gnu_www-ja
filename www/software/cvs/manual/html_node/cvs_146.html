<H2><A NAME="SEC153" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC153">Magic branch numbers</A></H2>

<P>
Externally, branch numbers consist of an odd number of
dot-separated decimal integers.  See section <A HREF="cvs_7.html#SEC8">Revision numbers</A>.  That is not the whole truth, however.  For
efficiency reasons CVS sometimes inserts an extra 0
in the second rightmost position (1.2.3 becomes
1.2.0.3, 8.9.10.11.12 becomes 8.9.10.11.0.12 and so
on).

</P>
<P>
CVS does a pretty good job at hiding these so
called magic branches, but in a few places the hiding
is incomplete:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The magic branch number appears in the output from
<CODE>cvs log</CODE>.

<LI>

You cannot specify a symbolic branch name to <CODE>cvs
admin</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>admin</CODE> command to reassign a
symbolic name to a branch the way RCS expects it
to be.  If <CODE>R4patches</CODE> is assigned to the branch
1.4.2 (magic branch number 1.4.0.2) in file
<TT>`numbers.c'</TT> you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -NR4patches:1.4.2 numbers.c
</PRE>

<P>
It only works if at least one revision is already
committed on the branch.  Be very careful so that you
do not assign the tag to the wrong number.  (There is
no way to see how the tag was assigned yesterday).
