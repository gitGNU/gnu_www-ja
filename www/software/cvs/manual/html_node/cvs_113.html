<H3><A NAME="SEC120" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC120">rdiff options</A></H3>

<P>
These standard options are supported by <CODE>rdiff</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="cvs_88.html#SEC90">Common command options</A>, for a complete description of
them):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most
recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; don't descend subdirectories.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use revision <VAR>tag</VAR>.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to the above, these options are available:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE>
<DD>
Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The
summary includes information about files that were
changed or added between the releases.  It is sent to
the standard output device.  This is useful for finding
out, for example, which files have changed between two
dates or revisions.

<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>
<DD>
A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard
output device.  This is most useful for seeing what the
last change to a file was.

<DT><CODE>-u</CODE>
<DD>
Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.
This option is not available if your diff does not
support the unidiff format.  Remember that old versions
of the <CODE>patch</CODE> program can't handle the unidiff
format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net
you should probably not use <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-V <VAR>vn</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Expand RCS keywords according to the rules current in
RCS version <VAR>vn</VAR> (the expansion format changed with
RCS version 5).
