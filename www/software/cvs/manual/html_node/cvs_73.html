<P>
You can customize CVS to log various kinds of
actions, in whatever manner you choose.  These
mechanisms operate by executing a script at various
times.  The script might append a message to a file
listing the information and the programmer who created
it, or send mail to a group of developers, or, perhaps,
post a message to a particular newsgroup.  To log
commits, use the <TT>`loginfo'</TT> file (see section <A HREF="cvs_137.html#SEC144">Loginfo</A>).
To log commits, checkouts, exports, and tags,
respectively, you can also use the <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> options in the
modules file.  For a more flexible way of giving
notifications to various users, which requires less in
the way of keeping centralized scripts up to date, use
the <CODE>cvs watch add</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="cvs_43.html#SEC45">Telling CVS to notify you</A>); this command is useful even if you are not
using <CODE>cvs watch on</CODE>.

The <TT>`taginfo'</TT> file defines programs to execute
when someone executes a <CODE>tag</CODE> or <CODE>rtag</CODE>
command.  The <TT>`taginfo'</TT> file has the standard form
for administrative files (see section <A HREF="cvs_129.html#SEC136">Reference manual for the Administrative files</A>), where each line is a regular expression
followed by a command to execute.  The arguments passed
to the command are, in order, the <VAR>tagname</VAR>,
<VAR>operation</VAR> (<CODE>add</CODE> for <CODE>tag</CODE>,
<CODE>mov</CODE> for <CODE>tag -F</CODE>, and <CODE>del</CODE> for
<CODE>tag -d</CODE>), <VAR>repository</VAR>, and any remaining are
pairs of <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>revision</VAR>.  A non-zero
exit of the filter program will cause the tag to be
aborted.
