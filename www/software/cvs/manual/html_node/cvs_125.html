<P>
After you've run checkout to create your private copy
of source from the common repository, other developers
will continue changing the central source.  From time
to time, when it is convenient in your development
process, you can use the <CODE>update</CODE> command from
within your working directory to reconcile your work
with any revisions applied to the source repository
since your last checkout or update.
