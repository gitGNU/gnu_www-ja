Version 1.3.1 Synopsis: commit [-lnRf] [-m 'log_message' |
-F file] [-r revision] [files...]
<LI>

Requires: working directory, repository.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
<LI>

Synonym: ci

<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> The <SAMP>`-f <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> option will
probably be renamed to <SAMP>`-F <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>
will be given a new behavior in future releases of CVS.

</P>
<P>
Use <CODE>commit</CODE> when you want to incorporate changes
from your working source files into the source
repository.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of
the files in your working current directory are
examined.  <CODE>commit</CODE> is careful to change in the
repository only those files that you have really
changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the
<SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option), files in subdirectories are also
examined and committed if they have changed; you can
use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to limit <CODE>commit</CODE> to the
current directory only.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>commit</CODE> verifies that the selected files are up
to date with the current revisions in the source
repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with <CODE>update</CODE> (see section <A HREF="cvs_125.html#SEC132">update--Bring work tree in sync with repository</A>).
<CODE>commit</CODE> does not call the <CODE>update</CODE> command
for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the
time is right.

</P>
<P>
When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to
enter a log message that will be written to one or more
logging programs (see section <A HREF="cvs_130.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>, and see section <A HREF="cvs_137.html#SEC144">Loginfo</A>)
and placed in the RCS history file inside the
repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
<CODE>log</CODE> command; See section <A HREF="cvs_109.html#SEC116">log--Print out log information for files</A>.  You can specify the
log message on the command line with the <SAMP>`-m
<VAR>message</VAR>'</SAMP> option, and thus avoid the editor invocation,
or use the <SAMP>`-f <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> option to specify
that the argument file contains the log message.
