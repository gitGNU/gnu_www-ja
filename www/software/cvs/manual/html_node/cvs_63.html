<H2><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC65">Updating a module with the import command</A></H2>

<P>
When a new release of the source arrives, you import it into the
repository with the same <CODE>import</CODE> command that you used to set up
the repository in the first place.  The only difference is that you
specify a different release tag this time.

</P>

<PRE>
$ tar xfz wdiff-0.05.tar.gz
$ cd wdiff-0.05
$ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.05" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_05
</PRE>

<P>
For files that have not been modified locally, the newly created
revision becomes the head revision.  If you have made local
changes, <CODE>import</CODE> will warn you that you must merge the changes
into the main trunk, and tell you to use <SAMP>`checkout -j'</SAMP> to do so.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -jFSF_DIST:yesterday -jFSF_DIST wdiff
</PRE>

<P>
The above command will check out the latest revision of
<SAMP>`wdiff'</SAMP>, merging the changes made on the vendor branch <SAMP>`FSF_DIST'</SAMP>
since yesterday into the working copy.  If any conflicts arise during
the merge they should be resolved in the normal way (see section <A HREF="cvs_38.html#SEC40">Conflicts example</A>).  Then, the modified files may be committed.

</P>
<P>
Using a date, as suggested above, assumes that you do
not import more than one release of a product per
day. If you do, you can always use something like this
instead:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout -jWDIFF_0_04 -jWDIFF_0_05 wdiff
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the two above commands are equivalent.
