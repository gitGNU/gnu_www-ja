If you want to make sure that all log messages look the
same way, you can use the <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file to
specify a program that is used to edit the log message.
This program could be a custom-made editor that always
enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a
simple shell script that calls an editor, and checks
that the entered message contains the required fields.

</P>
<P>
If no matching line is found in the <TT>`editinfo'</TT>
file, the editor specified in the environment variable
<CODE>$CVSEDITOR</CODE> is used instead.  If that variable is
not set, then the environment variable <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE>
is used instead.  If that variable is not
set a precompiled default, normally <CODE>vi</CODE>, will be
used.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file is often most useful together
with the <TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can be used to
specify a log message template.

</P>
<P>
Each line in the <TT>`editinfo'</TT> file consists of a
regular expression and a command-line template.  The
template must include a program name, and can include
any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

</P>
<P>
One thing that should be noted is that the <SAMP>`ALL'</SAMP>
keyword is not supported.  If more than one matching
line is found, the first one is used.  This can be
useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <SAMP>`DEFAULT'</SAMP>
line is used, if it is specified.

</P>
<P>
If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status,
the commit is aborted.

</P>
<P>
Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository,
or when the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> options to <CODE>cvs
commit</CODE> are used, <TT>`editinfo'</TT> will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this.
