<H4><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC94">Outdating is dangerous</A></H4>

<P>
First, an example of how <EM>not</EM> to use the
<CODE>admin</CODE> command.  It is included to stress the
fact that this command can be quite dangerous unless
you know <EM>exactly</EM> what you are doing.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option can be used to <EM>outdate</EM> old revisions
from the history file.  If you are short on disc this option
might help you.  But think twice before using it--there is no
way short of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!

</P>
<P>
The next line is an example of a command that you would
<EM>not</EM> like to execute.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -o:R_1_02 .
</PRE>

<P>
The above command will delete all revisions up to, and
including, the revision that corresponds to the tag
R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not
changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have
<EM>the same</EM> numerical revision number assigned to
the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only will it be
impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to
be restored from the tapes!

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC95">Comment leaders</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX337"></A>
<A NAME="IDX338"></A>
<A NAME="IDX339"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>$</CODE>Log$ keyword and you do
not agree with the guess for comment leader that
CVS has done, you can enforce your will with
<CODE>cvs admin -c</CODE>.  This might be suitable for
<CODE>nroff</CODE> source:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs admin -c'.\" ' *.man
$ rm *.man
$ cvs update
</PRE>

<P>
The two last steps are to make sure that you get the
versions with correct comment leaders in your working
files.
