When more than one person works on a software project
things often get complicated.  Often, two people try to
edit the same file simultaneously.  One solution, known
as <EM>file locking</EM> or <EM>reserved checkouts</EM>, is
to allow only one person to edit each file at a time.
This is the only solution with some version control
systems, including RCS and SCCS.  CVS
doesn't have a very nice implementation of reserved
checkouts (yet) but there are ways to get it working
(for example, see the <CODE>cvs admin -l</CODE> command in
section <A HREF="cvs_90.html#SEC92">admin options</A>).  It also may be possible to use
the watches features described below, together with
suitable procedures (not enforced by software), to
avoid having two people edit at the same time.

</P>
<P>
The default model with CVS is known as
<EM>unreserved checkouts</EM>.  In this model, developers
can edit their own <EM>working copy</EM> of a file
simultaneously.  The first person that commits his
changes has no automatic way of knowing that another
has started to edit it.  Others will get an error
message when they try to commit the file.  They must
then use CVS commands to bring their working copy
up to date with the repository revision.  This process
is almost automatic.

</P>
<P>
CVS also supports mechanisms which facilitate
various kinds of communcation, without actually
enforcing rules like reserved checkouts do.

</P>
<P>
The rest of this chapter describes how these various
models work, and some of the issues involved in
choosing between them.
