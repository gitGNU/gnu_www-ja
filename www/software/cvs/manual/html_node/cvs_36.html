Based on what operations you have performed on a
checked out file, and what operations others have
performed to that file in the repository, one can
classify a file in a number of states.  The states, as
reported by the <CODE>status</CODE> command, are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Up-to-date
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
 
The file is identical with the latest revision in the
repository for the branch in use.

<DT>Locally Modified
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
You have edited the file, and not yet committed your changes.

<DT>Locally Added
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
You have added the file with <CODE>add</CODE>, and not yet
committed your changes.

<DT>Locally Removed
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
You have removed the file with <CODE>remove</CODE>, and not yet
committed your changes.

<DT>Needs Checkout
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
repository.  The name is slightly misleading; you will
ordinarily use <CODE>update</CODE> rather than
<CODE>checkout</CODE> to get that newer revision.

<DT>Needs Patch
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send
a patch rather than the entire file.  Sending a patch or
sending an entire file accomplishes the same thing.

<DT>Needs Merge
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the repository, and you
have also made modifications to the file.

<DT>Unresolved Conflict
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous
<CODE>update</CODE> command gave a conflict.  You need to
resolve the conflict as described in section <A HREF="cvs_38.html#SEC40">Conflicts example</A>.

<DT>Unknown
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
CVS doesn't know anything about this file.  For
example, you have created a new file and have not run
<CODE>add</CODE>.

</DL>

<P>
To help clarify the file status, <CODE>status</CODE> also
reports the <CODE>Working revision</CODE> which is the
revision that the file in the working directory derives
from, and the <CODE>Repository revision</CODE> which is the
latest revision in the repository for the branch in
use.

</P>
<P>
For information on the options to <CODE>status</CODE>, see
section <A HREF="cvs_121.html#SEC128">status--Display status information on checked out files</A>.  For information on its <CODE>Sticky tag</CODE>
and <CODE>Sticky date</CODE> output, see section <A HREF="cvs_52.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>.
For information on its <CODE>Sticky options</CODE> output,
see the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option in section <A HREF="cvs_126.html#SEC133">update options</A>.
