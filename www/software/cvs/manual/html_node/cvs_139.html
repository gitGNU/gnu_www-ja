It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which
contains files which correspond to the latest version
in the repository.  For example, other developers might
want to refer to the latest sources without having to
check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site
with CVS and want every checkin to cause the files
used by the web server to be updated.

</P>
<P>
The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke
<CODE>cvs update</CODE>.  Doing so in the naive way will
cause a problem with locks, so the <CODE>cvs update</CODE>
must be run in the background.
Here is an example (this should all be on one line):

</P>

<PRE>
^cyclic-pages		(date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;
 cvs -q update -d) &#38;) &#62;&#62; $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2&#62;&#38;1
</PRE>

<P>
This will cause checkins to repository directories
starting with <CODE>cyclic-pages</CODE> to update the checked
out tree in <TT>`/u/www/local-docs'</TT>.
