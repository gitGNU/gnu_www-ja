<H3><A NAME="SEC111" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC111">history options</A></H3>

<P>
Several options (shown above as <SAMP>`-report'</SAMP>)  control  what
kind of report is generated:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>
Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time
the repository was modified).

<DT><CODE>-e</CODE>
<DD>
Everything (all record types); equivalent to specifying
<SAMP>`-xMACFROGWUT'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>module</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully
use <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> more than once on the command line.)

<DT><CODE>-o</CODE>
<DD>
Report on checked-out modules.

<DT><CODE>-T</CODE>
<DD>
Report on all tags.

<DT><CODE>-x <VAR>type</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Extract a particular set of record types <VAR>type</VAR> from the CVS
history.  The types are indicated by single letters,
which you may specify in combination.  

Certain commands have a single record type: 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>F</CODE>
<DD>
release
<DT><CODE>O</CODE>
<DD>
checkout
<DT><CODE>T</CODE>
<DD>
rtag
</DL>

One of four record types may result from an update:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>C</CODE>
<DD>
A merge was necessary but collisions were
detected (requiring manual merging).  
<DT><CODE>G</CODE>
<DD>
A merge was necessary and it succeeded.
<DT><CODE>U</CODE>
<DD>
A working file was copied from the repository.
<DT><CODE>W</CODE>
<DD>
The working copy of a file was deleted during
update (because it was gone from the repository).
</DL>

One of three record types results from commit:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>A</CODE>
<DD>
A file was added for the first time.
<DT><CODE>M</CODE>
<DD>
A file was modified.
<DT><CODE>R</CODE>
<DD>
A file was removed.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The options shown as <SAMP>`-flags'</SAMP> constrain or expand
the report without requiring option arguments:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>
Show data for all users (the default is to show data
only for the user executing <CODE>history</CODE>).

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Show last modification only.

<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>
Show only the records for modifications done from the
same working directory where <CODE>history</CODE> is
executing.
</DL>

<P>
The options shown as <SAMP>`-options <VAR>args</VAR>'</SAMP> constrain the report
based on an argument:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>str</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data back to a record containing  the  string
<VAR>str</VAR>  in  either the module name, the file name, or
the repository path.

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data since <VAR>date</VAR>.  This is slightly different
from the normal use of <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP>, which
selects the newest revision older than <VAR>date</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-p <VAR>repository</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show data for a particular source repository  (you
can specify several <SAMP>`-p'</SAMP> options on the same command
line).

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>rev</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records referring to revisions since the revision
or tag named <VAR>rev</VAR> appears in individual RCS
files.  Each RCS file is searched for the revision or
tag.

<DT><CODE>-t <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records since tag <VAR>tag</VAR> was last added to the the
history file.  This differs from the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> flag
above in that it reads only the history file, not the
RCS files, and is much faster.

<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Show records for user <VAR>name</VAR>.
</DL>
