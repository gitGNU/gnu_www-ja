Because renaming files and moving them between
directories is somewhat inconvenient, the first thing
you do when you start a new project should be to think
through your file organization.  It is not impossible
to rename or move files, but it does increase the
potential for confusion and CVS does have some
quirks particularly in the area of renaming
directories.  See section <A HREF="cvs_65.html#SEC67">Moving and renaming files</A>.

What to do next depends on the situation at hand.
