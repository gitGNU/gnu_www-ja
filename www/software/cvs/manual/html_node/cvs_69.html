If you want to be able to retrieve old versions of the
module, you must move each file in the directory
with the CVS commands.  See section <A HREF="cvs_66.html#SEC68">The Normal way to Rename</A>.  The old, empty
directory will remain inside the repository, but it
will not appear in your workspace when you check out
the module in the future.

</P>
<P>
If you really want to rename or delete a directory, you
can do it like this:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Inform everyone who has a copy of the module that the
directory will be renamed.  They should commit all
their changes, and remove their working copies of the
module, before you take the steps below.

<LI>

Rename the directory inside the repository.


<PRE>
$ cd $CVSROOT/<VAR>module</VAR>
$ mv <VAR>old-dir</VAR> <VAR>new-dir</VAR>
</PRE>

<LI>

Fix the CVS administrative files, if necessary (for
instance if you renamed an entire module).

<LI>

Tell everyone that they can check out the module and continue
working.

</OL>

<P>
If someone had a working copy of the module the CVS commands will
cease to work for him, until he removes the directory
that disappeared inside the repository.

</P>
<P>
It is almost always better to move the files in the
directory instead of moving the directory.  If you move the
directory you are unlikely to be able to retrieve old
releases correctly, since they probably depend on the
name of the directories.
