<P>
The overall structure of the repository is a directory
tree corresponding to the directories in the working
directory.  For example, supposing the repository is in
<TT>`/usr/local/cvsroot'</TT>, here is a possible directory
tree (showing only the directories):

</P>

 +--<TT>local</TT>

 |   +--<TT>cvsroot</TT>
 |   |    | 
 |   |    +--<TT>CVSROOT</TT>

              +--(other Yoyodyne software)
</PRE>

<P>
With the directories are <EM>history files</EM> for each file
under version control.  The name of the history file is
the name of the corresponding file with <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP>
appended to the end.  Here is what the repository for
the <TT>`yoyodyne/tc'</TT> directory might look like:

</P>

<PRE>
  <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>

    |   +--<TT>tc</TT>

The history files contain, among other things, enough
information to recreate any revision of the file, a log
of all commit messages and the user-name of the person
who committed the revision.  The history files are
known as <EM>RCS files</EM>, because the first program to
store files in that format was a version control system
known as RCS.  For a full
description of the file format, see the <CODE>man</CODE> page
<CITE>rcsfile(5)</CITE>, distributed with RCS.  This
file format has become very common--many systems other
than CVS or RCS can at least import history
files in this format.
