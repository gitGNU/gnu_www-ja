The overall format of all CVS commands is:

</P>

<PRE>
cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cvs</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the CVS program.

<DT><CODE>cvs_options</CODE>
<DD>
Some options that affect all sub-commands of CVS.  These are
described below.

<DT><CODE>cvs_command</CODE>
<DD>
One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit <SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>: <SAMP>`cvs -H'</SAMP> elicits a
list of available commands, and <SAMP>`cvs -v'</SAMP> displays version
information on CVS itself.

<DT><CODE>command_options</CODE>
<DD>
Options that are specific for the command.

<DT><CODE>command_args</CODE>
<DD>
Arguments to the commands.
</DL>

<P>
There is unfortunately some confusion between
<CODE>cvs_options</CODE> and <CODE>command_options</CODE>.
<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, when given as a <CODE>cvs_option</CODE>, only
affects some of the commands.  When it is given as a
<CODE>command_option</CODE> is has a different meaning, and
is accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.
