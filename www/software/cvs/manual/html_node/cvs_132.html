The <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> flag in the <TT>`modules'</TT> file can be
used to run a certain program whenever files are
committed (see section <A HREF="cvs_130.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>).  The files described in
this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

<P>
There are three kind of programs that can be run on
commit.  They are specified in files in the repository,
as described below.  The following table summarizes the
file names and the purpose of the corresponding
programs.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`commitinfo'</TT>
<DD>
The program is responsible for checking that the commit
is allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status
the commit will be aborted.

<DT><TT>`editinfo'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is used to edit the log message,
and possibly verify that it contains all required
fields.  This is most useful in combination with the
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> file, which can hold a log message
template (see section <A HREF="cvs_140.html#SEC147">Rcsinfo</A>).

<DT><TT>`loginfo'</TT>
<DD>
The specified program is called when the commit is
complete.  It receives the log message and some
additional information and can store the log message in
a file, or mail it to appropriate persons, or maybe
post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
imagination is the limit!
