<P>
Use the <CODE>import</CODE> command to check in the sources
for the first time.  When you use the <CODE>import</CODE>
command to track third-party sources, the <EM>vendor
tag</EM> and <EM>release tags</EM> are useful.  The
<EM>vendor tag</EM> is a symbolic name for the branch
(which is always 1.1.1, unless you use the <SAMP>`-b
<VAR>branch</VAR>'</SAMP> flag---See section <A HREF="cvs_106.html#SEC113">import options</A>).  The
<EM>release tags</EM> are symbolic names for a particular
release, such as <SAMP>`FSF_0_04'</SAMP>.

Suppose you use <CODE>wdiff</CODE> (a variant of <CODE>diff</CODE>
that ignores changes that only involve whitespace), and
are going to make private modifications that you want
to be able to use even when new releases are made in
the future.  You start by importing the source to your
repository:

</P>

<PRE>
$ tar xfz wdiff-0.04.tar.gz
$ cd wdiff-0.04
$ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.04" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_04
</PRE>

<P>
The vendor tag is named <SAMP>`FSF_DIST'</SAMP> in the above
example, and the only release tag assigned is
<SAMP>`WDIFF_0_04'</SAMP>.
