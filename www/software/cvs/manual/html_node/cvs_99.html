<H3><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="cvs_toc.html#TOC106">diff options</A></H3>

<P>
These standard options are supported by <CODE>diff</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="cvs_88.html#SEC90">Common command options</A>, for a complete description of
them):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date</VAR>.
See <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> for how this affects the comparison.

CVS can be configured to pass the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option
through to <CODE>rcsdiff</CODE> (which in turn passes it on
to <CODE>diff</CODE>.  GNU diff uses <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> as a way to
put <CODE>cpp</CODE>-style <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP> statements around the output
differences.  There is no way short of testing to
figure out how CVS was configured.  In the default
configuration CVS will use the <SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> option.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Process RCS keywords according to <VAR>kflag</VAR>.  See
co(1).

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<DT><CODE>-R</CODE>
<DD>
Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by
default.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Compare with revision <VAR>tag</VAR>.  Zero, one or two
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> options can be present.  With no <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>
option, the working file will be compared with the
revision it was based on.  With one <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>, that
revision will be compared to your current working file.
With two <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> options those two revisions will be
compared (and your working file will not affect the
outcome in any way).

One or both <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> options can be replaced by a
<SAMP>`-D <VAR>date</VAR>'</SAMP> option, described above.
</DL>

<P>
Any other options that are found are passed through to
<CODE>rcsdiff</CODE>, which in turn passes them to
<CODE>diff</CODE>.  The exact meaning of the options depends
on which <CODE>diff</CODE> you are using.  The long options
introduced in GNU diff 2.0 are not yet supported in
CVS.  See the documentation for your <CODE>diff</CODE> to see
which options are supported.
