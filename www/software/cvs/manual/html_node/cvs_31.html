When you begin using CVS, you will probably already have several
projects that can be
put under CVS control.  In these cases the easiest way is to use the
<CODE>import</CODE> command.  An example is probably the easiest way to
explain how to use it.  If the files you want to install in
CVS reside in <TT>`<VAR>wdir</VAR>'</TT>, and you want them to appear in the
repository as <TT>`$CVSROOT/yoyodyne/<VAR>rdir</VAR>'</TT>, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd <VAR>wdir</VAR>
$ cvs import -m "Imported sources" yoyodyne/<VAR>rdir</VAR> yoyo start
</PRE>

<P>
Unless you supply a log message with the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>
flag, CVS starts an editor and prompts for a
message.  The string <SAMP>`yoyo'</SAMP> is a <EM>vendor tag</EM>,
and <SAMP>`start'</SAMP> is a <EM>release tag</EM>.  They may fill
no purpose in this context, but since CVS requires
them they must be present.  See section <A HREF="cvs_61.html#SEC63">Tracking third-party sources</A>, for
more information about them.

</P>
<P>
You can now verify that it worked, and remove your
original source directory.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cd ..
$ mv <VAR>dir</VAR> <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig
$ cvs checkout yoyodyne/<VAR>dir</VAR>       # Explanation below
$ ls -R yoyodyne
$ rm -r <VAR>dir</VAR>.orig
</PRE>

<P>
Erasing the original sources is a good idea, to make sure that you do
not accidentally edit them in <VAR>dir</VAR>, bypassing CVS.
Of course, it would be wise to make sure that you have
a backup of the sources before you remove them.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>checkout</CODE> command can either take a module
name as argument (as it has done in all previous
examples) or a path name relative to <CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>,
as it did in the example above.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to check that the permissions
CVS sets on the directories inside <SAMP>`$CVSROOT'</SAMP>
are reasonable, and that they belong to the proper
groups.  See section <A HREF="cvs_18.html#SEC19">File permissions</A>.

</P>
<P>
If some of the files you want to import are binary, you
may want to use the wrappers features to specify which
files are binary and which are not.  See section <A HREF="cvs_131.html#SEC138">The cvswrappers file</A>.
