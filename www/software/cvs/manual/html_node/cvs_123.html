tag [-lR] [-b] [-c] [-d] symbolic_tag [files...]
<LI>

Requires: working directory, repository.
<LI>

Changes: repository.
<LI>

Synonym: freeze
</UL>

<P>
Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest
repository versions to your working sources.  The tags
are applied immediately to the repository, as with
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, but the versions are supplied implicitly by the
CVS records of your working files' history rather than
applied explicitly.

</P>
<P>
One use for tags is to record a snapshot of the
current sources when the software freeze date of a
project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze
date, only those changed sources that are to be part of
the release need be re-tagged.

</P>
<P>
The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which
revisions of which files were used in creating a
software distribution.  The <CODE>checkout</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands allow you to extract an exact
copy of a tagged release at any time in the future,
regardless of whether files have been changed, added,
or removed since the release was tagged.

</P>
<P>
This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag,
or to create a branch.  See the options section below.

</P>
<P>
If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists,
CVS will complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use
the <SAMP>`-F'</SAMP> option to force the new tag value.
