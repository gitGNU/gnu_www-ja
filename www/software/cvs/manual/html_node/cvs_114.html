<P>
Suppose you receive mail from <TT>foo@bar.com</TT> asking for an
update from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You
have no such patches on hand, but with CVS that can
easily be fixed with a command such as this:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
$$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' foo@bar.com
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch
called <SAMP>`R_1_3fix'</SAMP> for bugfixes.  <SAMP>`R_1_3_1'</SAMP>
corresponds to release 1.3.1, which was made some time
ago.  Now, you want to see how much development has been
done on the branch.  This command can be used:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name
