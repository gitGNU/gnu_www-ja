The following line produces a Unidiff (<SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> flag)
between revision 1.14 and 1.19 of
<TT>`backend.c'</TT>.  Due to the <SAMP>`-kk'</SAMP> flag no
keywords are substituted, so differences that only depend
on keyword substitution are ignored.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c

<P>
Suppose the experimental branch EXPR1 was based on a
set of files tagged RELEASE_1_0.  To see what has

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1
</PRE>

<P>
A command like this can be used to produce a context
diff between two releases:

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 &#62; diffs
</PRE>

<P>
If you are maintaining ChangeLogs, a command like the following
just before you commit your changes may help you write
the ChangeLog entry.  All local modifications that have
not yet been committed will be printed.

</P>

<PRE>
$ cvs diff -u | less
</PRE>
