<P>
The CVS client can also connect to the server
using a password protocol.  This is particularly useful
if using <CODE>rsh</CODE> is not feasible (for example,
the server is behind a firewall), and Kerberos also is
not available.

</P>
<P>
        To use this method, it is necessary to make
some adjustments on both the server and client sides.
