<P>
Up to this point, one of the weakest parts of CVS
has been the documentation.  CVS is a complex
program.  Previous versions of the manual were written
in the manual page format, which is not really well
suited for such a complex program.

</P>
<P>
When writing this manual, I had several goals in mind:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

No knowledge of RCS should be necessary.

<LI>

No previous knowledge of revision control software
should be necessary.  All terms, such as <EM>revision
numbers</EM>, <EM>revision trees</EM> and <EM>merging</EM> are
explained as they are introduced.

<LI>

The manual should concentrate on the things CVS users
want to do, instead of what the CVS commands can do.
The first part of this manual leads you through things
you might want to do while doing development, and
introduces the relevant CVS commands as they are
needed.

<LI>

Information should be easy to find.  In the reference
manual in the appendices almost all information about
every CVS command is gathered together.  There is also
an extensive index, and a lot of cross references.
</UL>
