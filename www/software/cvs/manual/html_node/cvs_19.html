<P>
The directory <TT>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT'</TT> contains some <EM>administrative
files</EM>.  See section <A HREF="cvs_129.html#SEC136">Reference manual for the Administrative files</A>, for a complete description.
You can use CVS without any of these files, but
some commands work better when at least the
<TT>`modules'</TT> file is properly set up.

</P>
<P>
The most important of these files is the <TT>`modules'</TT>
file.  It defines all modules in the repository.  This
is a sample <TT>`modules'</TT> file.

CVSROOT         CVSROOT
modules         CVSROOT modules
cvs             gnu/cvs
rcs             gnu/rcs
diff            gnu/diff
tc              yoyodyne/tc
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>`modules'</TT> file is line oriented.  In its
simplest form each line contains the name of the
module, whitespace, and the directory where the module
resides.  The directory is a path relative to
<CODE>$CVSROOT</CODE>.  The last four lines in the example
above are examples of such lines.

</P>

<P>
The line that defines the module called <SAMP>`modules'</SAMP>
uses features that are not explained here.
See section <A HREF="cvs_130.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>, for a full explanation of all the
available features.

</P>
<P>
You edit the administrative files in the same way that you would edit
any other module.  Use <SAMP>`cvs checkout CVSROOT'</SAMP> to get a working
copy, edit it, and commit your changes in the normal way.

</P>
<P>
It is possible to commit an erroneous administrative
file.  You can often fix the error and check in a new
revision, but sometimes a particularly bad error in the
administrative file makes it impossible to commit new
revisions.
