As long as you edit source files inside your working
copy of a module you can always find out the state of
your files via <SAMP>`cvs status'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`cvs log'</SAMP>.
But as soon as you export the files from your
development environment it becomes harder to identify
which revisions they are.

</P>
<P>
RCS uses a mechanism known as <EM>keyword
substitution</EM> (or <EM>keyword expansion</EM>) to help
identifying the files.  Embedded strings of the form
<CODE>$<VAR>keyword</VAR>$</CODE> and
<CODE>$<VAR>keyword</VAR>:...$</CODE> in a file are replaced
with strings of the form
<CODE>$<VAR>keyword</VAR>:<VAR>value</VAR>$</CODE> whenever you obtain
a new revision of the file.
