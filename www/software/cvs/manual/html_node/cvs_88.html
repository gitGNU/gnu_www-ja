This section describes the <SAMP>`command_options'</SAMP> that
are available across several CVS commands.  These
options are always given to the right of
<SAMP>`cvs_command'</SAMP>. Not all
commands support all of these options; each option is
only supported for commands where it makes sense.
However, when a command has one of these options you
can almost always count on the same behavior of the
option as in other commands.  (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have
different behavior from one CVS command to the other).

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the <SAMP>`history'</SAMP> command is an exception; it supports
many options that conflict even with these standard options.

<DT><CODE>-D <VAR>date_spec</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX321"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX322"></A>
 
Use the most recent revision no later than <VAR>date_spec</VAR>.
<VAR>date_spec</VAR> is a single argument, a date description
specifying a date in the past.

The specification is <EM>sticky</EM> when you use it to make a
private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working
file using <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>, CVS records the date you specified, so that
further updates in the same directory will use the same date
(for more information on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs_52.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>).

<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
A wide variety of date formats are supported by
CVS.  The <VAR>date_spec</VAR> is interpreted as being
in the local timezone, unless a specific timezone is
specified.  Examples of valid date specifications
include:


<PRE>
                    1 month ago
                    2 hours ago
                    400000 seconds ago
                    last year
                    last Monday
                    yesterday
                    a fortnight ago
                    3/31/92 10:00:07 PST
                    January 23, 1987 10:05pm
                    22:00 GMT
</PRE>

<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>,
<CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.
(The <CODE>history</CODE> command uses this option in a
slightly different way; see section <A HREF="cvs_104.html#SEC111">history options</A>).  Note
that when specifying a date like <SAMP>`3/31/92'</SAMP> it is
<CODE><VAR>month</VAR>/<VAR>day</VAR>/<VAR>year</VAR></CODE>.  So
<SAMP>`1/4/96'</SAMP> is January 4, not March 1.

Remember to quote the argument to the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag so that your shell doesn't interpret spaces as
argument separators.  A command using the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
flag can look like this:


<PRE>
$ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
When you specify a particular date or tag to CVS commands, they
normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option
if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
will be used). 

<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> is available with these commands: <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG>  The <CODE>commit</CODE> command also has a
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, but it has a different behavior for
that command.  See section <A HREF="cvs_96.html#SEC100">commit options</A>.

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
Help; describe the options available for this command.  This is
the only option supported for all CVS commands.

<DT><CODE>-k <VAR>kflag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Alter the default RCS processing of keywords.
See section <A HREF="cvs_75.html#SEC77">Keyword substitution</A>, for the meaning of
<VAR>kflag</VAR>.  Your <VAR>kflag</VAR> specification is
<EM>sticky</EM> when you use it to create a private copy
of a source file; that is, when you use this option
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> commands,
CVS associates your selected <VAR>kflag</VAR> with the
file, and continues to use it with future update
commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.

The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option is available with the <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE> and
<CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Local; run only in current working directory, rather than
recursing through subdirectories.  

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same
as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -l'</SAMP> option, which you can specify to the
left of a cvs command!

Available with the following commands: <CODE>checkout</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>log</CODE>,
<CODE>remove</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>, <CODE>rtag</CODE>,
<CODE>status</CODE>, <CODE>tag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
<A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<DT><CODE>-m <VAR>message</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use <VAR>message</VAR> as log information, instead of
invoking an editor.

Available with the following commands: <CODE>add</CODE>,
<CODE>commit</CODE> and <CODE>import</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not run any checkout/commit/tag program.  (A program can be
specified to run on each of these activities, in the modules
database (see section <A HREF="cvs_130.html#SEC137">The modules file</A>); this option bypasses it). 

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall <SAMP>`cvs -n'</SAMP>
option, which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

Available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>,
and <CODE>rtag</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>
Prune (remove) directories that are empty after being updated, on
<CODE>checkout</CODE>, or <CODE>update</CODE>.  Normally, an empty directory
(one that is void of revision-controlled files) is left alone.
Specifying <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP> will cause these directories to be silently
removed from your checked-out sources.  This does not remove the
directory from the repository, only from your checked out copy.
Note that this option is implied by the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
options of <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>export</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output,
rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available
with the <CODE>checkout</CODE> and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.

<DT><CODE>-W</CODE>
<DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can
use this option repeatedly.  The spec can be a file
name pattern of the same type that you can specify in
the <TT>`.cvswrappers'</TT> file.
Avaliable with the following commands: <CODE>import</CODE>,
and <CODE>update</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use the revision specified by the <VAR>tag</VAR> argument instead of the
default <EM>head</EM> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined
with the <CODE>tag</CODE> or <CODE>rtag</CODE> command, two special tags are
always available: <SAMP>`HEAD'</SAMP> refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and <SAMP>`BASE'</SAMP> refers to the
revision you last checked out into the current working directory.

The tag specification is sticky when you use this
with <CODE>checkout</CODE> or <CODE>update</CODE> to make your own
copy of a file: CVS remembers the tag and continues to use it on
future update commands, until you specify otherwise (for more information
on sticky tags/dates, see section <A HREF="cvs_52.html#SEC54">Sticky tags</A>).  The
tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag.
See section <A HREF="cvs_49.html#SEC51">Tags--Symbolic revisions</A>.

Specifying the <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> global option along with the
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> command option is often useful, to suppress
the warning messages when the RCS history file
does not contain the specified tag.

<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> this is not the same as the overall `cvs -r' option,
which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> is available with the <CODE>checkout</CODE>, <CODE>commit</CODE>,
<CODE>diff</CODE>, <CODE>history</CODE>, <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>rdiff</CODE>,
<CODE>rtag</CODE>, and <CODE>update</CODE> commands.
