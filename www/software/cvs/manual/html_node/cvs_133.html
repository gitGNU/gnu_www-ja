The four files <TT>`commitinfo'</TT>, <TT>`loginfo'</TT>,
<TT>`rcsinfo'</TT> and <TT>`editinfo'</TT> all have a common
format.  The purpose of the files are described later
on.  The common syntax is described here.

</P>
<P>
Each line contains the following:

<UL>
<LI>

A regular expression

<LI>

A whitespace separator--one or more spaces and/or tabs.

<LI>

A file name or command-line template.
</UL>

<P>
Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the
character <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are treated as comments.  Long lines
unfortunately can <EM>not</EM> be broken in two parts in
any way.

</P>
<P>
The first regular expression that matches the current
directory name in the repository is used.  The rest of the line
is used as a file name or command-line as appropriate.
