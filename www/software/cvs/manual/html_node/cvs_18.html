All <SAMP>`,v'</SAMP> files are created read-only, and you
should not change the permission of those files.  The
directories inside the repository should be writable by
the persons that have permission to modify the files in
each directory.  This normally means that you must
create a Unix group (see group(5)) consisting of the
persons that are to edit the files in a project, and
set up the repository so that it is that group that
owns the directory.

</P>
<P>
This means that you can only control access to files on
a per-directory basis.

</P>
<P>
Note that users must also have write access to check
out files, because CVS needs to create lock files
(see section <A HREF="cvs_40.html#SEC42">Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS</A>).

</P>
<P>
Also note that users must have write access to the
<TT>`CVSROOT/val-tags'</TT> file.  CVS uses it to keep
track of what tags are valid tag names (it is sometimes
updated when tags are used, as well as when they are
created, though).

CVS tries to set up reasonable file permissions
for new directories that are added inside the tree, but
you must fix the permissions manually when a new
directory should have different permissions than its
parent directory.  If you set the <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE>
environment variable that will control the file
permissions which CVS uses in creating directories
and/or files in the repository.  <CODE>CVSUMASK</CODE> does
not affect the file permissions in the working
directory; such files have the permissions which are
typical for newly created files, except that sometimes
CVS creates them read-only (see the sections on
watches, section <A HREF="cvs_42.html#SEC44">Telling CVS to watch certain files</A>; -r, section <A HREF="cvs_87.html#SEC89">Global options</A>; or CVSREAD, section <A HREF="cvs_144.html#SEC151">All environment variables which affect CVS</A>).

Since CVS was not written to be run setuid, it is
unsafe to try to run it setuid.  You cannot use the
setuid features of RCS together with CVS.
