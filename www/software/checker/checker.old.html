<p>The GNU checker package has been decommissioned, as <a
href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> does a better job and is being
actively maintained.  Old home page preserved below for archaeologists.

<P>
Checker is a tool which finds memory errors at runtime.  Its
primary function is to emit a warning when the program reads an
uninitialized variable or memory area, or when the program accesses an
unallocated memory area.

<p>
The Malloc library of Checker is very robust, though a bit slower
than the usual GNU Malloc.  Checker issues warnings when:
<ul>
<li> <code>free</code> or <code>realloc</code> is called with a
    pointer that has not been obtained from <code>malloc</code>,
    <code>calloc</code>, or <code>realloc</code>.
<li> <code>free</code> or <code>realloc</code> is called with a
    pointer that has been previously freed.
</ul>
    
<p>
Checker's Malloc will refrain from reusing a freed block
immediately; reuse of the block is delayed for some additional number
of calls to free.  This is to catch accesses to the block shortly
after it has been freed.

<p>
Checker implements a garbage detector that can be called either in
your program, by a debugger such as GDB, or on exit from the program.
The garbage detector displays all the memory leaks along with the
functions that called <code>malloc</code>.

<h4>Example</h4>

Here's a bogus file <code>example.c</code>:

<pre>
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

  int
  main ()
  {
    char *zone = malloc (20);
    char *ptr = NULL;
    int i;
    char c;

    c = zone[1];     /* error: read an uninitialized char */
    c = zone[-2];    /* error: read before the zone */
    zone[25] = ' ';  /* error: write after the zone */
    *ptr = 2;	     /* error: use a NULL pointer,
                        must produce a core */
  }
</pre>

To compile this example with Checker, simply use
<code>checkergcc</code> instead of <code>gcc</code>:

<pre>
% checkergcc -o example example.c
</pre>

Next, to run the example:

<pre>
  % ./example
</pre>

Execution produces these warnings:
