<h2>GNU Software in the Year 2000</h2>

<P>
Koos Schut maintains a <A HREF="/software/year2000-list.html">list of
GNU Software packages with information about Year 2000 properties
collected from volunteer users</A>.  That list is offered as a guide
and should not be construed as the record of a formal testing program
or as providing any guarantee of compliance or noncompliance.

<P>
The Free Software Foundation does not provide warranties for its
software.  We can't afford to.  So we can't promise that GNU software
has no Year 2000 bugs, any more than we could promise you the same
thing about another sort of bug.  But we can tell you some reasons why
such bugs are probably very few.

<P>
The main reason is theoretical.  GNU systems, and Unix-like systems
generally, represent a date/time as a 32-bit integer, counting seconds
from the beginning of 1970.  This 32-bit count will overflow in 2038;
but there will be no problem in that year, because by then all systems
will have redefined <code>time_t</code> to be a 64-bit integer.

<P>
We also have some practical evidence that such
problems are not widespread.  Some users running a
<A HREF="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">Linux-based GNU system</A>,
specifically Debian GNU/Linux, used their machines for a while
with the clocks set forward to the year 2000.  They reported no
special problems.
</P>

<P>
You can check that you are using the latest release of any particular
GNU program by checking one of our
<A HREF="/prep/ftp.html">FTP mirror sites</A>.
The <code>ls-lR</code> file in the
root directory of one of our FTP servers could be useful to get a list of all
available versions.
<P>
If you do encounter any problems with GNU software, even if they are
not related to the year 2000, you should send a bug report to the
developers of the program.
