<h2>Maxima</h2>

<p>(Maxima is free software, but it is not a GNU package.  However, the
GNU web site has long had this page about it, so it will remain for
reference.)

<P>
Maxima is a fairly complete computer algebra system written in lisp with
an emphasis on symbolic computation. It is based on DOE-MACSYMA and
licensed under the GPL. Its abilities include symbolic integration, 3D
plotting, and an ODE solver.
