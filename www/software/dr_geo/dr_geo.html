Dr Geo is an interactive geometry software. It allows the construction of 
interactive geometric figures. This means one can draw geometric figure 
based on mathematic property but also can move part of the figure in respect 
with its properties.

<P>
Dr Geo is an educational oriented software. It's an observatory to explore 
geometry situation in an interactive way in opposition to figure drawn on a 
sheet of paper. The user interface has been thing to be simple but efficient 
for young users. In this idea, Dr Geo can also handle different languages. 
It can can be used by mathematic teachers. In a class room to make a show or 
in a computer class room. Also the teacher can share Dr Geo with its students.

<P>
In spirit, Dr Geo want to be a free education tools for school where freedom 
and equality is so important.
