   </A></H4>

<P>
MARST is an Algol-to-C translator. It automatically translates programs
written on the algorithmic language Algol 60 to the C programming
language.

<P>
The MARST package includes three main components:

<UL>
<LI>
the translator, MARST, that translates Algol 60 programs to the C
programming language.
<LI>
the library, ALGLIB, that contains precompiled standard Algol 60
procedures and other necessary library routines. This library is to be
used at linking stage. (In the distribution the name <EM>libalgol.a</EM>
is used for this library.)
<LI>
the converter, MACVT, that allows to convert existing Algol 60 programs
from some other representations to MARST representation.
</UL>

<P>
The input language of the translator is hardware representation of full
(level 0) Algol 60 as described in the following IFIP document:

<P>
Modified Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60, <EM>The Computer
Journal</EM>, Vol. 19, No. 4, Nov. 1976, pp. 364&#151;79. (This document
is an official standard IFIP document. It is <EM>not</EM> a part of the
MARST package.)

<P>
Please note that there are some differences between the Revised Report
and the Modified Report since the latter is a result of application of
the following IFIP document to the Revised Report:

<P>
<EM>R. M. De Morgan, I. D. Hill, and B. A. Wichmann.</EM> A Supplement
to the Algol 60 Revised Report. <EM>The Computer Journal</EM>, Vol. 19,
No. 3, 1976, pp. 276&#151;88. (This document is an official standard
IFIP document. It is <EM>not</EM> a part of the MARST package.)

<P>
The translator and all library routines are written on basic dialect of
the C programming language, which is practically the same as widely
known 1989' ANSI C. The output code produced by the translator also uses
the same dialect.

<P>
Please note that the MARST translator has an inborn defect (not a bug):
it stops on the first error found. This means that to find all errors in
a source Algol program the user should perform several runs of the
translator (surely this defect is not essential if the source program
has no errors). The author plans to remove this defect in the future.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="#TOCdownloading" NAME="downloading">Downloading MARST</A>
   </H4>

<P>
MARST distribution can be found on in the subdirectory
<CODE>/gnu/marst/</CODE> on your favorite <A HREF="/prep/ftp.html">
GNU mirror</A>. For other ways to obtain MARST, please read
<A HREF="/software/software.html#HowToGetSoftware">
How to get GNU Software</A>.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="#TOCdocumentation" NAME="documentation">Documentation</A>
   </H4>
MARST brief guide can be found in its distribution (as plain text file
and as .info file). You may also look at manual pages (through
<EM>man marst</EM> at the shell prompt) on your system.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="#TOClists" NAME="lists">Mailing Lists/Newsgroups</A></H4>
MARST now has two mailing lists:
<A HREF="mailto:help-marst@gnu.org">&lt;help-marst@gnu.org&gt;</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:bug-marst@gnu.org">&lt;bug-marst@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

<P>
The main discussion list is 
<A HREF="mailto:help-marst@gnu.org">&lt;help-marst@gnu.org&gt;</A>,
and is used to discuss all aspects of MARST, including development and
porting.

<P>
Announcements about MARST and most other GNU Software are made on
<A HREF="mailto:info-gnu@gnu.org">&lt;info-gnu@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

<P>
There is also a special list used for reporting bugs,
<A HREF="mailto:bug-marst@gnu.org">&lt;bug-marst@gnu.org&gt;</A>. For
details on submitting a bug report, please see the section
<A HREF="#bug">Report a Bug</A> below.

<P>
To subscribe to any MARST mailing list, please send an empty mail with
a Subject: header line of just "subscribe" to the relevant -request
list. For example, to subscribe yourself to the main list, you would
send mail to <A HREF="mailto:help-marst-request@gnu.org">
&lt;help-marst-request@gnu.org&gt;</A> with no body and a Subject:
header line of just "subscribe".

<P>
Currently, there is no newsgroup dedicated to MARST.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="#TOCenhancement" NAME="enhancement">Request an Enhancement
</A></H4>
If you would like any new feature to be included in future versions of
MARST, please send a request to
<A HREF="mailto:help-marst@gnu.org">&lt;help-marst@gnu.org&gt;</A>.

<P>
Please remember that development of MARST is a volunteer effort, and
you can also contribute to its development. For information about
contributing to the GNU Project, please read <A HREF="/help/help.html">
How to help GNU</A>.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="#TOCbug" NAME="bug">Report a Bug</A></H4>
If you think you have found a bug in MARST, then you should send as
complete a report as possible to
<A HREF="mailto:bug-marst@gnu.org">&lt;bug-marst@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
Ideally, you should include the text you get by running
<EM>config.guess</EM>, the text you see when you run , and
<EM>configure</EM>, and if you can, a patch made with <EM>diff -u5</EM>
which fixes the problem.

<P>
