<h2>GTKeyboard</h2>

   <p>Gtkeyboard has been decommissioned, since no one has come forward to
   revive it, to improve it over the other free software virtual keyboard
   programs that are available. (If you are interested after all, email
   maintainers@gnu.org.)</p>

   <h4>Introduction to GTKeyboard</h4>

   <p>GTKeyboard is an application written in C with the aid of the <a href=
   "http://www.gtk.org">Gimp Toolkit</a>. It is intended to help users with
   physical disabilities to enter text into a simple editor, as well as to help
   them use other X11 applications that require keyboard input. GTKeyboard
   allows the user to press keys on an onscreen keyboard that will either be
   entered into a simple text editor that GTKeyboard provides, or into the
   application of choice that the user specifies by clicking on the window. It
   has also been used by people who have strange keyboard layouts, and by
   people who for one reason or another cannot use a keyboard with the machine
   in question. <a name="features" id="features"></a></p>

   <h4>Features</h4><br />
   Here is a small list of GTKeyboard&#39;s features, as of the current
   release:

   <ul>
      <li>Extensive shortcuts to speed up editing, both regular everyday
      editing shortcuts and HTML/programming shortcuts that enable you to speed
      up entry since you don&#39;t have the speed advantage of a touch
      typist.</li>

      <li>X Capabilies - GTKeyboard allows you to click on other windows and
      redirect the buttons that you press in GTKeyboard into the other
      application. Note, this doesn&#39;t work with some applications, they
      receive the X signal, but don&#39;t forward it to the proper widget.
      While I&#39;m working on that, I&#39;ve found that the best program to
      work with under X is rxvt - you can run emacs or your favorite mail
      program, etc. with rxvt and GTKeyboard.</li>

      <li>Other text editing features - GTKeyboard can pretend to be a regular
      low-level text editor similar to pico or the evil notepad most of us are
      familiar with. Cutting, pasting, copying, clearing all text, moving
      around, and other functions are the same as using a simple text
      editor.</li>

      <li>One of GTKeyboard&#39;s best features: It&#39;s GPL&#39;d.</li>

      <li>Saving, closing, and loading files just as you would with a normal
      text editor</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Downloading GTKeyboard</h4>

   <p>GTKeyboard can be found on <a href=
   "http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gtkeyboard/">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gtkeyboard/</a></p>

   <h4>Documentation</h4>

   <p>Documentation up to this point has been a bit sparse, but it&#39;s coming along, and it does its best to describe the features of GTKeyboard and the different things you can do with it to get the job done. All the documentation that is available with GTKeyboard comes with the distribution, so if you download the full source package, then you will get just about everything there is to get.</p>

   <p>The other source of documentation is me...if you have a question about
   GTKeyboard or if something isn&#39;t covered in the manual, email me and
   I&#39;ll answer it as best I can.</p>

   <p>The manual is also available online <a href=
   "/software/gtkeyboard/MANUAL.html">here</a>.</p>
