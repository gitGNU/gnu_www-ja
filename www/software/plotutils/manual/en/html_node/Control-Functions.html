<h4 class="subsection">9.4.1 Control functions</h4>

<p>The following are the &ldquo;control functions&rdquo; in <code>libplot</code>.  They are
the basic functions that open, initialize, or close an already-created
Plotter.  They are listed in the approximate order in which they would
be called.

   <p>In the current C&nbsp;binding<!-- /@w -->, each of these functions takes a pointer to
a <code>plPlotter</code> as its first argument.  Also in the current C&nbsp;binding<!-- /@w -->, the name of each function begins with "pl_" and ends with&nbsp;"_r"<!-- /@w -->.  ("_r"&nbsp;stands<!-- /@w --> for `revised' or `reentrant'.)  For information
on older C&nbsp;bindings<!-- /@w -->, see <a href="Older-C-APIs.html#Older-C-APIs">Older C APIs</a>.  In&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> C++
binding, these are member functions of the <code>Plotter</code> class and its
subclasses, and the prefix and suffix are not used.

     <dl>
<dt>int <tt>openpl</tt> ();<dd><tt>openpl</tt> opens a Plotter, i.e., begins a page of graphics.  This
resets the Plotter's drawing attributes to their default values.  A&nbsp;negative<!-- /@w --> return value indicates the Plotter could not be opened.

     <p>Currently, an X Plotter pops&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> a new window on an X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w -->
System display for each page of graphics, i.e., with each invocation of
<code>openpl</code>.  Future releases may support window re-use.

     <br><dt>int <tt>bgcolor</tt> (int <var>red</var>, int <var>green</var>, int <var>blue</var>);<dd><tt>bgcolor</tt> sets the background color for the Plotter's graphics
display, using a 48-bit RGB color model.  The arguments <var>red</var>,
<var>green</var> and <var>blue</var> specify the red, green and blue intensities
of the background color.  Each is an integer in the range
<tt>0x0000</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>0xffff</tt>, i.e., 0<small class="dots">...</small>65535.  The choice (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0)<!-- /@w --> signifies black, and the choice (65535, 65535, 65535) signifies
white.

     <p><tt>bgcolor</tt> affects only Plotters that have a notion of background
color, i.e., X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, X Drawable Plotters, PNG Plotters, PNM
Plotters, and GIF Plotters (all of which produce bitmaps), CGM Plotters,
ReGIS Plotters and Metafile Plotters.  Its effect is simple: the next
time the <tt>erase</tt> operation is invoked on such a Plotter, its display
will be filled with the specified color.

     <br><dt>int <tt>bgcolorname</tt> (const char *<var>name</var>);<dd><tt>bgcolorname</tt> sets the background color for the the graphics display
to be <var>name</var>.  Unrecognized colors are interpreted as "white".  For
information on what color names are recognized, see <a href="Color-Names.html#Color-Names">Color Names</a>. 
A&nbsp;24-bit<!-- /@w --> RGB color may also be specified as a six-digit hexadecimal
string, e.g., "#c0c0c0".

     <p><tt>bgcolorname</tt> affects only Plotters that have a notion of background
color, i.e., X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters, PNG Plotters, PNM
Plotters, and GIF Plotters (all of which produce bitmaps), CGM Plotters,
ReGIS Plotters, and Metafile Plotters.  Its effect is simple: the next
time the <tt>erase</tt> operation is invoked on such a Plotter, its display
will be filled with the specified color.

     <p>SVG Plotters and CGM Plotters support "none" as a value for the
background color.  It will turn&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> the background: the drawn
objects will not be backed by anything.  This is useful when the
generated SVG or WebCGM file is to be placed on a Web page.

     <br><dt>int <tt>erase</tt> ();<dd><tt>erase</tt> begins the next frame of a multiframe page, by clearing all
previously plotted objects from the graphics display, and filling it
with the background color (if&nbsp;any)<!-- /@w -->.

     <p>It is frequently useful to invoke <tt>erase</tt> at the beginning of each
page, i.e., immediately after invoking <tt>openpl</tt>.  That is because some
Plotters are persistent, in the sense that objects drawn within an
<code>openpl</code><small class="dots">...</small><code>closepl</code> pair remain on the graphics display
even after a new page is begun by a subsequent invocation of
<code>openpl</code>.  Currently, only X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters and Tektronix
Plotters are persistent.  Future releases may support optional
persistence for X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w --> also.

     <p>On X Plotters and X Drawable Plotters the effects of invoking <tt>erase</tt>
will be altogether different if the Plotter parameter
<code>USE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING</code> is set to "yes".  In&nbsp;this<!-- /@w --> case, objects
will be written to an off-screen buffer rather than to the graphics
display, and invoking <tt>erase</tt> will (1)&nbsp;copy<!-- /@w --> the contents of this
buffer to the display, and (2)&nbsp;erase<!-- /@w --> the buffer by filling it with
the background color.  This `double buffering' feature facilitates
smooth animation.  See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>space</tt> (int <var>x0</var>, int <var>y0</var>, int <var>x1</var>, int <var>y1</var>);<dt>int <tt>fspace</tt> (double <var>x0</var>, double <var>y0</var>, double <var>x1</var>, double <var>y1</var>);<dd><tt>space</tt> and <tt>fspace</tt> take two pairs of arguments, specifying the
positions of the lower left and upper right corners of a rectangular
window in the user coordinate system that will be mapped to the
`viewport': the rectangular portion of the output device that graphics
will be drawn&nbsp;in<!-- /@w -->.  The default window is a square, with opposite
corners (0,0) and&nbsp;(1,1)<!-- /@w -->.

     <p>In mathematical terms, calling <tt>space</tt> or <tt>fspace</tt> sets the affine
transformation from user coordinates to device coordinates.  That is, it
sets the transformation matrix attribute for each object subsequently
drawn on the display.  Either <tt>space</tt> or <tt>fspace</tt> would usually be
invoked at the beginning of each page of graphics, i.e., immediately
after the call to <tt>openpl</tt>.  Additional calls to <tt>space</tt> or
<tt>fspace</tt> are allowed, and there are several &ldquo;mapping functions&rdquo; that
also affect the transformation matrix attribute.  See <a href="Mapping-Functions.html#Mapping-Functions">Mapping Functions</a>.

     <p>Note that the size and location of the viewport depend on the type of
Plotter, and on the Plotter parameters that are specified at Plotter
creation time.  For example, the default viewport used by any
Illustrator, Postscript, Fig, PCL, and HP-GL Plotter is a square whose
size depends on the Plotter's page type.  See <a href="Page-and-Viewport-Sizes.html#Page-and-Viewport-Sizes">Page and Viewport Sizes</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>space2</tt> (int <var>x0</var>, int <var>y0</var>, int <var>x1</var>, int <var>y1</var>, int <var>x2</var>, int <var>y2</var>);<dt>int <tt>fspace2</tt> (double <var>x0</var>, double <var>y0</var>, double <var>x1</var>, double <var>y1</var>, double <var>x2</var>, double <var>y2</var>);<dd><tt>space2</tt> and <tt>fspace2</tt> are extended versions of <tt>space</tt> and
<tt>fspace</tt>.  Their arguments are the three defining vertices of an
parallelogram-shaped window in the user coordinate system.  The
specified vertices are the lower left, the lower right, and the upper
left.  This window will be mapped affinely onto the viewport: the
rectangular portion of the output device that graphics will be drawn&nbsp;in<!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt>int <tt>havecap</tt> (const char *<var>s</var>);<dd><tt>havecap</tt> is not really a control function: it is a query function. 
It&nbsp;tests<!-- /@w --> whether or not a Plotter, which need not be open, has a
specified capability.  The return value is 0,&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->, or&nbsp;2<!-- /@w -->,
signifying no/yes/maybe.  For unrecognized capabilities the return value
is zero.  Recognized capabilities include "WIDE_LINES" (i.e., the
ability to draw lines with a non-default thickness), "DASH_ARRAY" (the
ability to draw in arbitrary dashing styles, as requested by the
<tt>linedash</tt> function), "SETTABLE_BACKGROUND" (the ability to set the
color of the background), and "SOLID_FILL".  The "HERSHEY_FONTS",
"PS_FONTS", "PCL_FONTS", and "STICK_FONTS" capabilities indicate whether
or not fonts of a particular class are supported.  See <a href="Text-Fonts.html#Text-Fonts">Text Fonts</a>.

     <p>All Plotters except Tektronix Plotters have the "SOLID_FILL" capability,
meaning they can fill paths with solid color.  Each such Plotter has at
least one of the "EVEN_ODD_FILL" and "NONZERO_WINDING_NUMBER_FILL"
capabilities.  These indicate the supported rules for determining the
`inside' of a path.

     <p>The `maybe' value is returned for most capabilities by Metafile
Plotters, which do no drawing themselves.  The output of a Metafile
Plotter must be translated to another format, or displayed, by invoking
<code>plot</code>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>flushpl</tt> ();<dd><tt>flushpl</tt> flushes (i.e., pushes onward) all previously plotted objects
to the graphics display.  This is useful only if the affected Plotter is
one that does real-time plotting (X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w -->
Plotters, ReGIS Plotters, Tektronix Plotters, and Metafile Plotters). 
It&nbsp;ensures<!-- /@w --> that all previously plotted objects are visible to the
user.  On&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w --> that do not do real-time plotting, this operation
has no effect.

     <br><dt>int <tt>closepl</tt> ();<dd><tt>closepl</tt> closes a Plotter, i.e., ends a page of graphics.  If a path
is in progress, it is first ended and plotted, as if <tt>endpath</tt> had
been called.  A&nbsp;negative<!-- /@w --> return value indicates the Plotter could
not be closed.

     <p>In the present release of <code>libplot</code>, some Plotters output each page
of graphics immediately after it is plotted, i.e., when <tt>closepl</tt> is
invoked to end the page.  That is the case with PCL and HP-GL Plotters,
in particular.  Plotters that can output only a single page of graphics
(PNG, PNM, GIF, SVG, Illustrator, and Fig Plotters) do so immediately
after the first page is plotted, i.e., when <tt>closepl</tt> is invoked for
the first time.  Postscript and CGM Plotters store all pages of graphics
internally, and do not produce output until they are deleted.
