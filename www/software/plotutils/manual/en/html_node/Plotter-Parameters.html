<h3 class="section">9.5 Plotter parameters</h3>

<p>In designing the <code>libplot</code> library, every effort was made to make
the Plotter interface independent of the type of Plotter.  To&nbsp;the<!-- /@w -->
extent that Plotters display individual (i.e., instance-specific)
behavior, that behavior is captured by a manageable number of
<em>Plotter parameters</em>.  Each parameter has a value that is allowed
to be a generic pointer (a&nbsp;<code>void&nbsp;*</code><!-- /@w -->).  For most parameters, the
value is a string (a&nbsp;<code>char&nbsp;*</code><!-- /@w -->).

   <p>The parameter values of any Plotter are constant over the lifetime of
the Plotter, and are specified when the Plotter is created.  In the C&nbsp;binding<!-- /@w -->, a&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> for any parameter is specified by calling the
<code>pl_setplparam</code> function.  The <code>pl_setplparam</code> function acts
on a <code>plPlotterParams</code> object, which encapsulates Plotter
parameters.  When a Plotter is created by calling <code>pl_newpl_r</code>,
a&nbsp;pointer<!-- /@w --> to a <code>plPlotterParams</code> object is passed as the final
argument.

   <p>If at Plotter creation time a parameter is <em>not</em> specified, its
default value will be used, unless the parameter is string-valued and
there is an environment variable of the same name, in which case the
value of that environment variable will be used.  This rule increases
run-time flexibility: an&nbsp;application<!-- /@w --> programmer may allow
non-critical Plotter parameters to be specified by the user via
environment variables.

   <p>In the C++ binding, the <code>PlotterParams</code> class and
<code>PlotterParams::setplparam</code>, a&nbsp;member<!-- /@w --> function, are the
analogues of the <code>plPlotterParams</code> datatype and the function
<code>pl_setplparam</code>.

   <p>The following are the currently recognized parameters (unrecognized ones
are ignored).  The most important ones are <code>DISPLAY</code>, which affects
X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, <code>BITMAPSIZE</code>, which affects X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, PNG
Plotters, PNM Plotters, and GIF Plotters, <code>PAGESIZE</code>, which affects
Illustrator, Postscript, CGM, Fig, and HP-GL Plotters, and
<code>ROTATION</code>, which affects all Plotters except Metafile Plotters. 
These four parameters are listed first and the others alphabetically. 
Most of the remaining parameters, such as the several whose names begin
with "HPGL", affect only a single type of Plotter.

     <dl>
<dt><tt>DISPLAY</tt><dd>(Default NULL.)  The X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System display on which the graphics
display will be popped&nbsp;up<!-- /@w -->, as an X&nbsp;window<!-- /@w -->.  This is relevant
only to X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt><code>BITMAPSIZE</code><dd>(Default "570x570".)  The size of the graphics display (i.e., the
viewport) in terms of pixels.  This is relevant only to X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->,
PNG Plotters, PNM Plotters, and GIF Plotters.  For X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, the
value of this parameter will automatically, if it is not set, be taken
from the X&nbsp;resource<!-- /@w --> <code>Xplot.geometry</code>.  That is for backward
compatibility.

     <p>X Plotters support precise positioning of the graphics display.  For
example, if <code>BITMAPSIZE</code> is "570x570+0+0" then it will be
positioned in the upper left corner of the X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System display.

     <br><dt><code>PAGESIZE</code><dd>(Default "letter".)  The page type, which determines the size of the
graphics display (i.e., the viewport) used by the Plotter.  This is
relevant only to SVG, Illustrator, Postscript, CGM, Fig, PCL, and HP-GL
Plotters.  "letter" means an 8.5<span class="dmn">in</span> by 11<span class="dmn">in</span> page.  Any ISO
page size in the range "a0"<small class="dots">...</small>"a4" or ANSI page size in the range
"a"<small class="dots">...</small>"e" may be specified ("letter" is an alias for&nbsp;"a"<!-- /@w --> and
"tabloid" is an alias for&nbsp;"b"<!-- /@w -->).  "legal", "ledger", and&nbsp;"b5"<!-- /@w --> are
recognized page sizes also.

     <p>For Illustrator, Postscript, PCL and Fig Plotters, the graphics
display will be, by default, a square region centered on the specified
page.  (For example, it will be a centered 8<span class="dmn">in</span> square if
<code>PAGESIZE</code> is "letter".)  For HP-GL Plotters, it will be a square
region of the same size, but will not by&nbsp;default<!-- /@w --> be centered.  SVG
format and WebCGM format have no notion of the Web page on which the
graphics display will ultimately be positioned.  They do have a notion
of default display size, though this will normally be overridden when
the SVG or WebCGM file is placed on a Web page.  For this default
display size, SVG and CGM Plotters will use the same graphics display
size that is used by other Plotters.

     <p>For the default size (and location) of the graphics display for each
page type, see <a href="Page-and-Viewport-Sizes.html#Page-and-Viewport-Sizes">Page and Viewport Sizes</a>.  You do not need to use
the default size, since either or both of its dimensions can be
specified explicitly.  For example, <code>PAGESIZE</code> could be specified
as "letter,xsize=4in", or "a4,xsize=10cm,ysize=15cm".  The dimensions
are allowed to be negative (a&nbsp;negative<!-- /@w --> dimension results in a
reflection).

     <p>For Plotters other than SVG and CGM Plotters, the position of the
graphics display on the page, relative to its default position, can be
adjusted by specifying an offset vector.  For example, <code>PAGESIZE</code>
could be specified as "letter,yoffset=1.2in", or
"a4,xoffset=&minus;5mm,yoffset=2.0cm".  Inches, centimeters, and
millimeters are the supported units.  The "xoffset" and "yoffset"
options may be used in conjunction with "xsize" and "ysize".

     <p>It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> also possible to position the graphics display precisely, by
specifying the location of its lower left corner relative to the lower
left corner of the page.  For example, <code>PAGESIZE</code> could be
specified as "letter,xorigin=2in,yorigin=3in", or
"a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm".  The "xorigin" and "yorigin" options
may be used in conjunction with "xsize" and "ysize".  SVG and WebCGM
Plotters ignore the "xoffset", "yoffset", "xorigin", and "yorigin"
options, since SVG format and WebCGM format have no notion of the Web
page on which the graphics display will ultimately be positioned.

     <br><dt><code>ROTATION</code><dd>(Default "0.0".)  Relevant to all Plotters other than Metafile
Plotters, which have no output device.  The angle, in degrees, by
which the graphics display (i.e., the viewport) should be rotated,
relative to its default orientation.  The rotation is
counterclockwise.

     <p>A rotated viewport does not change the position of its four corners. 
Rather, the graphics are rotated within&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> viewport is
rectangular rather than square, this `rotation' necessarily includes a
rescaling.

     <p>This parameter is useful for switching between portrait and landscape
orientations.  Internally, it determines the affine transformation from
NDC (normalized device coordinate) space to device space.

     <br><dt><code>BG_COLOR</code><dd>(Default "white".)  The initial background color of the graphics
display, when drawing each page of graphics.  This is relevant to X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, PNG Plotters, PNM Plotters, GIF Plotters, CGM Plotters, ReGIS
Plotters, and Metafile Plotters; also to X&nbsp;Drawable&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w --> (for
the last, the background color shows&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> only if <code>erase</code> is
invoked).  For information on what color names are recognized, see
<a href="Color-Names.html#Color-Names">Color Names</a>.  The background color may be changed at any later
time by invoking the <tt>bgcolor</tt> (or <tt>bgcolorname</tt>) and <tt>erase</tt>
operations.

     <p>SVG Plotters and CGM Plotters support "none" as a value for the
background color.  It will turn&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> the background: the drawn
objects will not be backed by anything.  This is useful when the
generated SVG or WebCGM file is to be placed on a Web page.

     <br><dt><code>CGM_ENCODING</code><dd>(Default "binary".)  Relevant only to CGM Plotters.  "binary" means that
the CGM output should use the binary encoding.  "clear_text" means that
the CGM output should use a human-readable encoding.  The WebCGM profile
requires that the binary encoding be used, but many CGM viewers and
interpreters can also parse the clear text encoding.  The third standard
CGM encoding, "character", is not currently supported.

     <br><dt><code>CGM_MAX_VERSION</code><dd>(Default "4".)  Relevant only to CGM Plotters.  An upper bound on the
version number of CGM format that is produced.  Many older CGM
interpreters and viewers, such as the ones built into Microsoft Office
and other commercial software, only support version&nbsp;1<!-- /@w --> CGM files. 
For fully adequate handling of fonts and line styles, version&nbsp;3<!-- /@w --> is
necessary.  By default, the present release of <code>libplot</code> produces
version&nbsp;3<!-- /@w --> CGM files, i.e., it does not use version&nbsp;4<!-- /@w --> features.

     <br><dt><code>EMULATE_COLOR</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant to all Plotters.  "yes" means that each color
in the output should be replaced by an appropriate shade of gray.  The
well known formula for CIE luminance, namely 0.212671R + 0.715160G
+ 0.072169B, is used.

     <p>This parameter is seldom useful, except when using a PCL Plotter to
prepare output for a monochrome PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> device.  Many monochrome
PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> devices, such as monochrome LaserJets, do a poor job of
emulating color on their own.  They usually map HP-GL/2's seven standard
pen colors, including even yellow, to black.

     <br><dt><code>GIF_ANIMATION</code><dd>(Default "yes".)  Relevant only to GIF Plotters.  "yes" means that the
<code>erase</code> operation will have special semantics: with the exception
of its first invocation, it will act as a separator between successive
images in the written-out pseudo-GIF file.  "no"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> that
<code>erase</code> should act as it does on other Plotters that do not write
graphics in real time, i.e., it&nbsp;should<!-- /@w --> erase the image under
construction by filling it with the background color.  If&nbsp;"no"<!-- /@w --> is
specified, the pseudo-GIF file will contain only a single image.

     <br><dt><code>GIF_DELAY</code><dd>(Default "0".)  Relevant only to GIF Plotters.  The delay, in hundredths
of a second, after each image in a written-out animated pseudo-GIF file. 
The value should be an integer in the range "0"<small class="dots">...</small>"65535".

     <br><dt><code>GIF_ITERATIONS</code><dd>(Default "0".)  Relevant only to GIF Plotters.  The number of times that
an animated pseudo-GIF file should be `looped'.  The value should be an
integer in the range "0"<small class="dots">...</small>"65535".

     <br><dt><code>HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to HP-GL Plotters, and only if the value
of <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w -->.  "no"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> to draw with a fixed
set of pens, specified by setting the <code>HPGL_PENS</code> parameter.  "yes"
means that pen colors will not restricted to the palette specified in
<code>HPGL_PENS</code>: colors will be assigned to &ldquo;logical pens&rdquo; in the
range #1<small class="dots">...</small>#31, as&nbsp;needed<!-- /@w -->.  Other than color LaserJet printers
and DesignJet plotters, not many HP-GL/2 devices allow the assignment of
colors to logical pens.  In particular, HP-GL/2 pen plotters do not. 
So&nbsp;this<!-- /@w --> parameter should be used with caution.

     <br><dt><code>HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE</code><dd>(Default "yes".)  Relevant only to HP-GL Plotters, and only if the value
of <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w -->.  "yes" means that the HP-GL/2 output
device should be switched into opaque mode, rather than transparent
mode.  This allows objects to be filled with opaque white and other
opaque colors.  It&nbsp;also<!-- /@w --> allows the drawing of visible white lines,
which by convention are drawn with pen&nbsp;#0<!-- /@w -->.  Not all HP-GL/2 devices
support opaque mode or the use of pen&nbsp;#0<!-- /@w --> to draw visible white
lines.  In particular, HP-GL/2 pen plotters do&nbsp;not<!-- /@w -->.  Some older
HP-GL/2 devices reportedly malfunction if asked to switch into opaque
mode.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> output of an HP-GL Plotter is to be sent to such a
device, a&nbsp;"no"<!-- /@w --> value is recommended.

     <br><dt><code>HPGL_PENS</code><dd>(Default "1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan" if the
value of <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is "1.5" or&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> and "1=black" if the
value of <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"1"<!-- /@w -->.  Relevant only to HP-GL
Plotters.  The set of available pens; the format should be
self-explanatory.  The color for any pen in the range #1<small class="dots">...</small>#31 may
be specified.  For information on what color names are recognized, see
<a href="Color-Names.html#Color-Names">Color Names</a>.  Pen&nbsp;#1<!-- /@w --> must always be present, though it need
not be black.  Any pen in the range #2<small class="dots">...</small>#31 may be omitted.

     <br><dt><code>HPGL_ROTATE</code><dd>(Default "0".)  Relevant only to HP-GL Plotters.  The angle, in degrees,
by which the graphics display (i.e., the viewport) should be rotated on
the page relative to the default orientation.  Recognized values are
"0", "90", "180", and "270"; "no"&nbsp;and<!-- /@w --> "yes" are equivalent to "0"&nbsp;and&nbsp;"90"<!-- /@w --> respectively.  "180" and "270" are supported only if
<code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w -->.

     <p>The rotation requested by <code>HPGL_ROTATE</code> is different from the sort
requested by the <code>ROTATION</code> parameter.  <code>ROTATION</code> rotates the
graphics display in&nbsp;place<!-- /@w -->, but <code>HPGL_ROTATE</code> both rotates the
graphics display and moves its lower left corner toward another corner
of the page.  Altering the plotting area in such a way is supported by
the HP-GL language.

     <p>The <code>HPGL_ROTATE</code> parameter facilitates switching between portrait
and landscape orientations.  For HP-GL devices that is frequently a
concern, since some HP-GL devices (&ldquo;plotters&rdquo;) draw with a default
landscape orientation, while others (&ldquo;printers&rdquo;) draw with a default
portrait orientation.  There is no programmatic way of determining which
is which.

     <br><dt><code>HPGL_VERSION</code><dd>(Default "2".)  Relevant only to HP-GL Plotters.  "1"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> that the
output should be generic HP-GL, "1.5"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> that the output should
be suitable for the HP7550A graphics plotter and the HP758x, HP7595A and
HP7596A drafting plotters (HP-GL with some HP-GL/2 extensions), and
"2"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> that the output should be modern HP-GL/2.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w -->
version is less than "2" then the only available fonts will be vector
fonts, and all paths will be drawn with a default thickness, so that
invoking <tt>linewidth</tt>, <tt>capmod</tt>, <tt>joinmod</tt>, and <tt>fmiterlimit</tt>
will have no effect.  Also, the `nonzero winding number rule' will not
be supported when filling paths, so invoking <tt>fillmod</tt> will have no
effect.  Additionally, if the version is&nbsp;"1"<!-- /@w --> then the filling of
arbitrary paths will not be supported (circles and rectangles aligned
with the coordinate axes may be filled, however).

     <br><dt><code>INTERLACE</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to PNG and GIF Plotters.  If the value is
"yes", the output file will be interlaced.  That means it will be
displayed in an interlaced (nonlinear) way by many applications.

     <br><dt><code>MAX_LINE_LENGTH</code><dd>(Default "500".)  The maximum number of defining points that a path may
have, before it is flushed to the output device.  If this flushing
occurs, the path will be split into two or more sub-paths, though the
splitting should not be noticeable.  Splitting will not be performed if
the path is to be filled.

     <p>This parameter is relevant to all Plotters except Tektronix and Metafile
Plotters.  The reason for splitting long paths is that some display
devices (e.g., old Postscript printers and HP-GL pen plotters) have
limited buffer sizes.  It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> not relevant to Tektronix or Metafile
Plotters, since they draw paths in real time and have no buffer
limitations.

     <br><dt><code>META_PORTABLE</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to Metafile Plotters.  "yes" means that
the output metafile should use a portable (human-readable) encoding of
graphics, rather than the default (binary) encoding.  See <a href="Metafiles.html#Metafiles">Metafiles</a>.

     <br><dt><code>PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to PCL Plotters.  "no"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> to draw
with a fixed set of pens.  "yes" means that pen colors will not
restricted to this palette: colors will be assigned to &ldquo;logical pens&rdquo;,
as&nbsp;needed<!-- /@w -->.  Other than color LaserJet printers, not many PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w -->
devices allow the assignment of colors to logical pens.  So&nbsp;this<!-- /@w -->
parameter should be used with caution.

     <br><dt><code>PCL_BEZIERS</code><dd>(Default "yes".)  Relevant only to PCL Plotters.  "yes"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> that
when drawing Bezier curves, the special `Bezier instructions' will be
used.  "no"&nbsp;means<!-- /@w --> that these instructions will not be used. 
Instead, each Bezier curve will be approximated and drawn as a polygonal
line.  Other than the LaserJet III, which was Hewlett&ndash;Packard's first
PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> printer, all Hewlett&ndash;Packard's PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> printers support the
Bezier instructions.

     <br><dt><code>PNM_PORTABLE</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to PNM Plotters.  "yes" means that the
output should be in a portable (human-readable) version of PBM/PGM/PPM
format, rather than the default (binary) version.  `Portable' is
something of a misnomer, since binary PBM/PGM/PPM files are also
portable, in the sense that they are machine-independent.

     <br><dt><code>TERM</code><dd>(Default NULL.)  Relevant only to Tektronix Plotters.  If the value is
a string beginning with "xterm", "nxterm", or "kterm", it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> taken
as a sign that the current application is running in an X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w -->
System VT100 terminal emulator: an&nbsp;<code>xterm</code><!-- /@w -->, <code>nxterm</code>, or
<code>kterm</code>.  Before drawing graphics, a Tektronix Plotter will emit an
escape sequence that causes the terminal emulator's auxiliary Tektronix
window, which is normally hidden, to pop&nbsp;up<!-- /@w -->.  After the graphics are
drawn, an escape sequence that returns control to the original VT100
window will be emitted.  The Tektronix window will remain on the screen.

     <p>If the value is a string beginning with "kermit", "ansi.sys", or
"nansi.sys", it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> taken as a sign that the current application is
running in the VT100 terminal emulator provided by the MS-DOS version of
<code>kermit</code>.  Before drawing graphics, a Tektronix Plotter will emit
an escape sequence that switches the terminal emulator to Tektronix
mode.  Also, some of the Tektronix control codes emitted by the Plotter
will be <code>kermit</code>-specific.  There will be a limited amount of color
support, which is not normally the case (the 16 <code>ansi.sys</code> colors
will be supported).  The "dotdotdashed" line style will be supported,
which is also not normally the case.  After drawing graphics, the
Plotter will emit an escape sequence that returns the emulator to VT100
mode.  The key sequence `ALT&nbsp;minus<!-- /@w -->' may be employed manually within
<code>kermit</code> to switch between the two modes.

     <br><dt><code>TRANSPARENT_COLOR</code><dd>(Default "none".)  Relevant only to PNG and GIF Plotters.  If the value
is a recognized color name, that color, if it appears in the output
file, will be treated as transparent by most applications.  For
information on what names are recognized, see <a href="Color-Names.html#Color-Names">Color Names</a>.

     <p>If <code>TRANSPARENT_COLOR</code> is set and an animated pseudo-GIF file is
produced, the `restore to background' disposal method will be used for
each image in the file.  Otherwise, the `unspecified' disposal method
will be used.

     <br><dt><code>USE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to X Plotters and X Drawable Plotters. 
If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> value is "yes", a double buffering scheme will be used when
drawing graphics.  Each frame of graphics, within a
<tt>openpl</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>closepl</tt> pair, will be written to an off-screen
buffer rather than to the Plotter's display.  When <tt>erase</tt> is invoked
to end a frame, or when <tt>closepl</tt> is invoked, the contents of the
off-screen buffer will be copied to the Plotter's display, pixel by
pixel.  If successive frames differ only slightly, this will create the
illusion of smooth animation.

     <p>Some X displays provide special hardware support for double buffering. 
If&nbsp;this<!-- /@w --> support is available, the X&nbsp;Plotter<!-- /@w --> will detect its
presence, and will draw graphics using the appropriate extension to the
X11 protocol (either DBE or MBX).  In this case the animation will be
significantly faster; on high-end graphics hardware, at&nbsp;least<!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt><code>VANISH_ON_DELETE</code><dd>(Default "no".)  Relevant only to X Plotters.  If the value is "yes",
when a Plotter is deleted, the window or windows that it has popped&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> will vanish.  Otherwise, each such window will remain on the screen
until it is removed by the user (by typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; in&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->, or by
clicking with a mouse).

     <br><dt><code>XDRAWABLE_COLORMAP</code><dd>(Default NULL.)  Relevant only to X&nbsp;Drawable&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->.  If the
value is non-NULL, it should be a <code>Colormap *</code>, a&nbsp;pointer<!-- /@w --> to a
colormap from which colors should be allocated.  NULL indicates that the
colormap to be used should be the default colormap of the default screen
of the X&nbsp;display<!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt><code>XDRAWABLE_DISPLAY</code><dd>(Default NULL.)  Relevant only to X Drawable Plotters.  The value
should be a <code>Display *</code>, a&nbsp;pointer<!-- /@w --> to the X&nbsp;display<!-- /@w --> with
which the drawable(s) to be drawn&nbsp;in<!-- /@w --> are associated.

     <br><dt><code>XDRAWABLE_DRAWABLE1</code><dt><code>XDRAWABLE_DRAWABLE2</code><dd>(Default NULL.)  Relevant only to X Drawable Plotters.  If set, the
value of each of these parameters should be a <code>Drawable *</code>, a
pointer to a drawable to be drawn&nbsp;in<!-- /@w -->.  A&nbsp;`drawable'<!-- /@w --> is either a
window or a pixmap.  At the time an X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotter is created,
at&nbsp;least<!-- /@w --> one of the two parameters must be set.

     <p>X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters support simultaneous drawing in two drawables
because it is often useful to be able to draw graphics simultaneously in
both an X&nbsp;window<!-- /@w --> and its background pixmap.  If two drawables are
specified, they must have the same dimensions and depth, and be
associated with the same screen of the X&nbsp;display<!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt><code>XDRAWABLE_VISUAL</code><dd>(Default NULL.)  Relevant only to X&nbsp;Drawable&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->.  If set, the
value should be a <code>Visual *</code>, a&nbsp;pointer<!-- /@w --> to the `visual' with
which the colormap (see above) is associated.  Setting this parameter is
not required, but it is recommended that it be set if
<code>XDRAWABLE_COLORMAP</code> is set.  Under some circumstances, that will
speed&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> color cell allocation.

     <br><dt><code>X_AUTO_FLUSH</code><dd>(Default "yes".)  Relevant only to X Plotters.  If the value is "yes",
an <code>XFlush</code> operation is performed after each drawing operation. 
That ensures that graphics are flushed to the X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System
display, and are visible to the user, immediately after they are drawn. 
However, it slows down rendering considerably.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> value is
"no", drawing is faster, since it does not take place in real time.
