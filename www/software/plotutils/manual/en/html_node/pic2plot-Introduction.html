<h3 class="section">4.1 What <code>pic2plot</code> is used for</h3>

<p>The <code>pic2plot</code> program takes one or more files in the pic language,
and either displays the figures that they contain on an X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w -->
System display, or produces an output file containing the figures.  Many
graphics file formats are supported.

   <p>The pic language is a `little language' that was developed at Bell
Laboratories for creating box-and-arrow diagrams of the kind frequently
found in technical papers and textbooks.  A&nbsp;directory<!-- /@w --> containing
documentation on the pic language is distributed along with the plotting
utilities.  On&nbsp;most<!-- /@w --> systems it is installed as
<samp><span class="file">/usr/share/pic2plot</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/pic2plot</span></samp>.  The
directory includes Brian Kernighan's original technical report on the
language, Eric&nbsp;S.<!-- /@w --> Raymond's tutorial on the GNU implementation, and
some sample pic macros contributed by the late W.&nbsp;Richard<!-- /@w --> Stevens.

   <p>The pic language was originally designed to work with the <code>troff</code>
document formatter.  In that context it is read by a translator called
<code>pic</code>, or its GNU counterpart <code>gpic</code>.  Since extensive
documentation on <code>pic</code> and <code>gpic</code> is available, this section
simply gives an example of an input file, and mentions some extra
features supported by <code>pic2plot</code>.

   <p>A pic file contains one or more figures, each of the box-and-arrow type. 
Each figure is begun by a line reading <tt>.PS</tt>, and ended by a line
reading <tt>.PE</tt>.  Lines that are not contained in a
<tt>.PS</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>.PE</tt> pair are ignored.  Each&nbsp;figure<!-- /@w --> is built from
geometrical objects, such as rectangular boxes, circles, ellipses,
quarter circles (&ldquo;arcs&rdquo;), polygonal lines, and splines.  Arcs,
polygonal lines, and spline may be equipped with arrowheads.  Any object
may be labeled with one or more lines of text.

   <p>Objects are usually positioned not by specifying their positions in
absolute coordinates, but rather by specifying their positions relative
to other, previously drawn objects.  The following figure is an example.

<pre class="example">     .PS
     box "START"; arrow; circle dashed filled; arrow
     circle diam 2 thickness 3 "This is a" "big, thick" "circle" dashed; up
     arrow from top of last circle; ellipse "loopback" dashed
     arrow dotted from left of last ellipse to top of last box
     arc cw radius 1/2 from top of last ellipse; arrow
     box "END"
     .PE
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you put this example in a file and run &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pic2plot -T X</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
file, a window containing the figure will be popped&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> on your X&nbsp;display<!-- /@w -->.  Similarly, if you run &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pic2plot -T ps</span></samp>&rsquo; on the file, a
Postscript file containing the figure will be written to standard
output.  The Postscript file may be edited with the <code>idraw</code> drawing
editor.  Other graphics formats such as PNG format, PNM format,
pseudo-GIF format, SVG format, WebCGM format, or Fig format (which is
editable with the <code>xfig</code> drawing editor) may be obtained similarly. 
You would use the options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T png</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T pnm</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T gif</span></samp>&rsquo;,
<code>samp -T svg</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T cgm</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T fig</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.

   <p>The above example illustrates some of the features of the pic language. 
By default, successive objects are drawn so as to touch each other.  The
drawing proceeds in a certain direction, which at startup is
left-to-right.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">up</span></samp>&rsquo; command changes this direction to
bottom-to-top, so that the next object (the arrow extending from the top
of the big circle) will point upward rather than to the right.

   <p>Objects have sizes and other attributes, which may be set globally, or
specified on a per-object basis.  For example, the diameter of a circle
may be specified, or the radius of an arc.  An&nbsp;arc<!-- /@w --> may be oriented
clockwise rather than counterclockwise by specifying the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cw</span></samp>&rsquo;
attribute.  The line style of most objects may be altered by specifying
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dashed</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dotted</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute.  Also, any object may be
labeled, by specifying one or more text strings as attributes.  A&nbsp;text<!-- /@w --> string may contain escape sequences that shift the font, append
subscripts or superscripts, or include non-ASCII characters and
mathematical symbols.  See <a href="Text-String-Format.html#Text-String-Format">Text String Format</a>.

   <p>Most sizes and positions are expressed in terms of `virtual inches'. 
The use of virtual inches is peculiar to <code>pic2plot</code>.  The graphics
display used by <code>pic2plot</code>, i.e., its drawing region, is defined to
be a square, 8&nbsp;virtual<!-- /@w --> inches wide and 8&nbsp;virtual<!-- /@w --> inches high. 
If the page size for the output file is the "letter" size, which is the
default for Postscript output, virtual inches will the same as real
inches.  But a different page size may be specified; for example, by
using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--page-size a4</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  If&nbsp;so<!-- /@w -->, a virtual inch will
simply equal one-eighth of the width of the graphics display.  On&nbsp;A4<!-- /@w -->
paper, the graphics display is a square of size 19.81cm.

   <p>By default, each figure is centered in the graphics display.  You may
turn off centering, so that you can use absolute coordinates, by using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  For example, a figure consisting only of the
object &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">arrow from (8,8) to (4,4)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be positioned in the
absence of centering so that the head of the arrow is at the center of
the display.  Its tail will be at the upper right corner.

   <p>The thickness of lines is not specified in terms of virtual inches.  For
compatibility with <code>gpic</code>, it is specified in terms of virtual
points.  The example above, which specifies the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thickness</span></samp>&rsquo;
attribute of one of the objects, illustrates this.  There are 72&nbsp;virtual<!-- /@w --> points per virtual inch.

   <p>If there is more than one figure to be displayed, they will appear in
different X&nbsp;windows<!-- /@w -->, or on successive pages of the output file. 
Some output formats (such&nbsp;as<!-- /@w --> PNG, PNM, pseudo-GIF, SVG, Illustrator,
and Fig) support only a single page of graphics.  If&nbsp;any<!-- /@w --> of those
output formats is chosen, only the first figure will appear in the
output file.  Currently, <code>pic2plot</code> cannot produce animated
pseudo-GIFs.

   <p>The preceding survey does not do justice to the pic language, which is
actually a full-featured programming language, with support for
variables, looping constructs, etc.  Its advanced features make the
drawing of large, repetitive diagrams quite easy.
