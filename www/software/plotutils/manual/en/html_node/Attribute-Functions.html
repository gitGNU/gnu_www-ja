<h4 class="subsection">9.4.3 Attribute-setting functions</h4>

<p>The following are the &ldquo;attribute functions&rdquo; in <code>libplot</code>.  When
invoked on a Plotter, these functions set its drawing attributes, or
save them or restore them.  Path-related attributes include graphics
cursor position, pen color, fill color, fill rule, line thickness, line
style, cap style, join style, miter limit, and transformation matrix. 
Text-related attributes include pen color, font name, font size, text
angle, and transformation matrix.

   <p>Setting any path-related drawing attribute automatically terminates and
draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as&nbsp;if<!-- /@w --> the
<code>endpath</code> operation had been invoked.  The `orientation' attribute
(clockwise/counterclockwise), which affects circles, ellipses, and
boxes, is an exception to this.  The exception allows a compound path to
include circles, ellipses, and boxes with different orientations.

   <p>In the current C&nbsp;binding<!-- /@w -->, each of these functions takes a pointer to
a <code>plPlotter</code> as its first argument.  Also in the current C&nbsp;binding<!-- /@w -->, the name of each function begins with "pl_" and ends with&nbsp;"_r"<!-- /@w -->.  ("_r"&nbsp;stands<!-- /@w --> for `revised' or `reentrant'.)  For information
on older C&nbsp;bindings<!-- /@w -->, see <a href="Older-C-APIs.html#Older-C-APIs">Older C APIs</a>.  In&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> C++
binding, these are member functions of the <code>Plotter</code> class and its
subclasses, and the prefix and suffix are not used.

     <dl>
<dt>int <tt>capmod</tt> (const char *<var>s</var>);<dd><tt>capmod</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the cap mode (i.e.,
cap style) for all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display. 
Recognized styles are "butt" (the default), "round", and "projecting". 
The three styles are visibly distinct only if the line thickness is
fairly large.  Butt caps do&nbsp;not<!-- /@w --> extend beyond the end of the path. 
The other two kinds do, however.  Round caps are filled semicircles, and
projecting caps are filled rectangular regions that extend a distance
equal to half the line width beyond the end of the path.

     <p>PNG, PNM, GIF, PCL, and HP-GL Plotters support a fourth cap mode,
"triangular".  (For all but PCL and HP-GL Plotters, the support is
currently only partial.)  Plotters other than these treat "triangular"
as equivalent to "round".

     <p>This function has no effect on ReGIS or Tektronix Plotters.  Also, it
has no effect on HP-GL Plotters if the parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is
set to a value less than&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default), or on CGM Plotters if
the parameter <code>CGM_MAX_VERSION</code> is set to a value less than&nbsp;"3"<!-- /@w -->.  See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>color</tt> (int <var>red</var>, int <var>green</var>, int <var>blue</var>);<dd><tt>color</tt> is a convenience function.  Calling <tt>color</tt> is equivalent to
calling both <tt>pencolor</tt> and <tt>fillcolor</tt>, to set both the the pen
color and fill color of all objects subsequently drawn on the graphics
display.  Note that the physical fill color depends also on the fill
level, which is specified by calling <tt>filltype</tt>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>colorname</tt> (const char *<var>name</var>);<dd><tt>colorname</tt> is a convenience function.  Calling <tt>colorname</tt> is
equivalent to calling both <tt>pencolorname</tt> and <tt>fillcolorname</tt>, to
set both the the pen color and fill color of all objects subsequently
drawn on the graphics display.  Note that the physical fill color
depends also on the fill level, which is specified by calling
<tt>filltype</tt>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>fillcolor</tt> (int <var>red</var>, int <var>green</var>, int <var>blue</var>);<dd><tt>fillcolor</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the fill color for
all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display, using a 48-bit RGB
color model.  The arguments <var>red</var>, <var>green</var> and <var>blue</var>
specify the red, green and blue intensities of the fill color.  Each is
an integer in the range <tt>0x0000</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>0xffff</tt>, i.e.,
0<small class="dots">...</small>65535.  The choice (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0)<!-- /@w --> signifies black, and the choice
(65535, 65535, 65535) signifies white.  Note that the physical fill
color depends also on the fill level, which is specified by calling
<tt>filltype</tt>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>fillcolorname</tt> (const char *<var>name</var>);<dd><tt>fillcolorname</tt> sets the fill color of all paths subsequently drawn on
the graphics display to be <var>name</var>.  Unrecognized colors are
interpreted as "black".  For information on what color names are
recognized, see <a href="Color-Names.html#Color-Names">Color Names</a>.  A&nbsp;24-bit<!-- /@w --> RGB color may also be
specified as a six-digit hexadecimal string, e.g., "#c0c0c0".

     <p>Note that the physical fill color depends also on the fill level, which
is specified by calling <tt>filltype</tt>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>fillmod</tt> (const char *<var>s</var>);<dd><tt>fillmod</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the fill mode, i.e.,
fill rule, for all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display. 
The fill rule affects only compound paths and self-intersecting simple
paths: it determines which points are `inside'.  Two rules are
supported: "even-odd" (the default for all Plotters), and
"nonzero-winding".  For the distinction, see the <cite>Postscript
Language Reference Manual</cite>.  "alternate" is an alias for "even-odd" and
"winding" is an alias for "nonzero-winding".

     <p>CGM, Fig, and ReGIS Plotters do not support the "nonzero-winding" rule,
because the CGM, Fig, and ReGIS vector graphics formats do not
support&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.  Also, HP-GL Plotters do not support "nonzero-winding"
if <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is set to a value less than "2" (the default). 
See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <p>The LaserJet III, which was Hewlett&ndash;Packard's first PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> printer,
did not support the nonzero-winding fill rule.  However, all later
PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> printers from Hewlett&ndash;Packard support&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.

     <br><dt>int <tt>filltype</tt> (int <var>level</var>);<dd><tt>filltype</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the fill level for
all subsequently drawn paths.  A&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> of&nbsp;0<!-- /@w --> for <var>level</var>
specifies no filling.  This is the default.  A&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> of&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->
specifies 100% filling: the fill color will be the color previously
specified by calling <tt>fillcolor</tt> or <tt>fillcolorname</tt>.

     <p>As a convenience to the user, <var>level</var> may be set to any value in the
range <tt>0x0000</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>0xffff</tt>, i.e., 0<small class="dots">...</small>65535.  Any nonzero
value will produce filling.  If <var>level</var>=<tt>0xffff</tt>, the fill color
will be white.  Values in the range <tt>0x0001</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>0xffff</tt> are
interpreted as specifying a desaturation, or gray level.  For&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->, <tt>0x8000</tt> specifies 50% filling (the fill color will be
half-way between the color specified by calling <tt>fillcolor</tt> or
<tt>fillcolorname</tt>, and white).

     <p>To draw the region bounded by a path in an edgeless way, you would call
<tt>filltype</tt> to turn&nbsp;on<!-- /@w --> the filling of the interior, and <tt>pentype</tt>
to turn&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> the drawing of the boundary.

     <p>Tektronix Plotters do not support filling, and HP-GL Plotters support
filling of arbitrary paths only if the parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is
equal to "1.5" or&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default).  (If the version is&nbsp;"1"<!-- /@w -->
then only circles and rectangles aligned with the coordinate axes may be
filled.)  <em>Opaque</em> filling, including white filling, is supported
only if the parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> and the parameter
<code>HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE</code> is "yes" (the default).  See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>fmiterlimit</tt> (double <var>limit</var>);<dd><tt>fmiterlimit</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the miter limit for
all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display.  The miter limit
controls the treatment of corners, if the join mode is set to "miter"
(the default).  At&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> join point of a path, the `miter length' is
defined to be the distance between the inner corner and the outer
corner.  The miter limit is the maximum value that will be tolerated for
the miter length divided by the line thickness.  If this value is
exceeded, the miter will be cut&nbsp;off<!-- /@w -->: the "bevel" join mode will be
used instead.

     <p>Examples of typical values for <var>limit</var> are 10.43 (the default, which
cuts off miters if the join angle is less than 11 degrees), 2.0 (the
same, for 60 degrees), and 1.414 (the same, for 90 degrees).  In&nbsp;general<!-- /@w -->, the miter limit is the cosecant of one-half the minimum angle
for mitered joins.  The minimum meaningful value for <var>limit</var> is&nbsp;1.0<!-- /@w -->, which converts all mitered joins to beveled joins, irrespective of
join angle.  Specifying a value less than 1.0 resets the limit to the
default.

     <p>This function has no effect on X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters or X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, since the X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System miter limit, which is also
10.43, cannot be altered.  It also has no effect on Tektronix, ReGIS, or
Fig Plotters, or on HP-GL Plotters if the parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code>
is set to a value less than&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default).  See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.  The miter limit used by HP-GL or PCL Plotters is always
rounded to the closest integer, downward.

     <br><dt>int <tt>fontname</tt> (const char *<var>font_name</var>);<dt>double <tt>ffontname</tt> (const char *<var>font_name</var>);<dd><tt>fontname</tt> and <tt>ffontname</tt> take a single case-insensitive string
argument, <var>font_name</var>, specifying the name of the font to be used
for all text strings subsequently drawn on the graphics display.  (The
font for plotting strings is fully specified by calling <tt>fontname</tt>,
<tt>fontsize</tt>, and <tt>textangle</tt>.)  The size of the font in user
coordinates is returned.

     <p>The default font name depends on the type of Plotter.  It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w -->
"Helvetica" for all Plotters except for PCL Plotters, for which it is
"Univers", and PNG, PNM, GIF, HP-GL, ReGIS, Tektronix and Metafile
Plotters, for which it is "HersheySerif".  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> argument
<var>font_name</var> is NULL or the empty string, or the font is not
available, the default font name will be used.  Which fonts are
available also depends on the type of Plotter; for a list of all
available fonts, see <a href="Text-Fonts.html#Text-Fonts">Text Fonts</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>fontsize</tt> (int <var>size</var>);<dt>double <tt>ffontsize</tt> (double <var>size</var>);<dd><tt>fontsize</tt> and <tt>ffontsize</tt> take a single argument, interpreted as
the size, in the user coordinate system, of the font to be used for all
text strings subsequently drawn on the graphics display.  (The font for
plotting strings is fully specified by calling <tt>fontname</tt>,
<tt>fontsize</tt>, and <tt>textangle</tt>.)  The size of the font in user
coordinates is returned.

     <p>A&nbsp;negative<!-- /@w --> value for <var>size</var> sets the size to the default, which
depends on the type of Plotter.  Typically, the default font size is
1/50 times the size (i.e., minimum dimension) of the display.  The
interpretation of zero font size is also Plotter-dependent (most
Plotters do not draw text strings if the font size is zero).

     <br><dt>int <tt>joinmod</tt> (const char *<var>s</var>);<dd><tt>joinmod</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the join mode (i.e.,
join style) for all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display. 
Recognized styles are "miter" (the default), "round", and "bevel".  The
three styles are visibly distinct only if the line thickness is fairly
large.  Mitered joins are sharp, rounded joins are round, and beveled
joins are squared&nbsp;off<!-- /@w -->.  However, unusually sharp joins are never
mitered: instead, they are beveled.  The angle at which beveling
replaces mitering may be specified by calling <tt>fmiterlimit</tt>.

     <p>PNG, PNM, GIF, PCL, and HP-GL Plotters support a fourth join mode,
"triangular".  Other Plotters treat "triangular" as equivalent to
"round".

     <p>This function has no effect on ReGIS or Tektronix Plotters.  Also, it
has no effect on HP-GL Plotters if the parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is
set to a value less than&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default), or on CGM Plotters if
the parameter <code>CGM_MAX_VERSION</code> is set to a value less than&nbsp;"3"<!-- /@w -->.  See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>linedash</tt> (int <var>n</var>, const int *<var>dashes</var>, int <var>offset</var>);<dt>int <tt>flinedash</tt> (int <var>n</var>, const double *<var>dashes</var>, double <var>offset</var>);<dd><tt>linedash</tt> and <tt>flinedash</tt> terminate and draw the path under
construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and set
the line style for all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display. 
They provide much finer control of dash patterns than the <tt>linemod</tt>
function (see below) provides.  <var>dashes</var> should be an array of
length&nbsp;<var>n</var><!-- /@w -->.  Its elements, which should be positive, are
interpreted as distances in the user coordinate system.  Along any path,
circle, or ellipse, the elements
<var>dashes</var>[0]<small class="dots">...</small><var>dashes</var>[<var>n</var>-1] alternately specify the
length of a dash and the length of a gap between dashes.  When the end
of the array is reached, the reading of the array wraps around to the
beginning.  If the array is empty, i.e., <var>n</var> equals zero, there is
no dashing: the drawn line is solid.

     <p>The <var>offset</var> argument specifies the `phase' of the dash pattern
relative to the start of the path.  It is interpreted as the distance
into the dash pattern at which the dashing should begin.  For example,
if <var>offset</var> equals zero then the path will begin with a dash, of
length <var>dashes</var>[0] in user space.  If&nbsp;<var>offset</var><!-- /@w --> equals
<var>dashes</var>[0] then the path will begin with a gap of length
<var>dashes</var>[1], and so&nbsp;forth<!-- /@w -->.  <var>offset</var> is allowed to be
negative.

     <p>Not all Plotters fully support <tt>linedash</tt> and <tt>flinedash</tt>.  PCL and
HP-GL Plotters cannot dash with a nonzero offset, and in the dash
patterns used by X&nbsp;and<!-- /@w --> X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters, each dash or gap has
a maximum length of 255 pixels.  <tt>linedash</tt> and <tt>flinedash</tt> have no
effect at&nbsp;all<!-- /@w --> on Tektronix, ReGIS, and Fig Plotters.  Also, they
have no effect on HP-GL Plotters for which the parameter
<code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is less than&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default), or on CGM
Plotters for which the parameter <code>CGM_MAX_VERSION</code> is less than&nbsp;"3"<!-- /@w -->.  For information on Plotter parameters, see <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <p><strong>Warning</strong>: If the transformation from the user coordinate system
to the device coordinate system is anisotropic, each dash pattern should
ideally be drawn on the graphics display with a length that depends on
its direction.  But currently, only SVG and Postscript Plotters do&nbsp;this<!-- /@w -->.  Other Plotters always draw any specified dash pattern with the
same length, irrespective of its direction.  The length that is used is
the minimum length, in the device coordinate system, that can correspond
to the specified dash pattern length in the user coordinate system.

     <br><dt>int <tt>linemod</tt> (const char *<var>s</var>);<dd><tt>linemod</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the line style for
all paths subsequently drawn on the graphics display.  The supported
line styles are "solid", "dotted", "dotdashed", "shortdashed",
"longdashed", "dotdotdashed", "dotdotdotdashed", and "disconnected". 
The first seven correspond to the following dash patterns:

     <pre class="example">          "solid"             --------------------------------
          "dotted"            -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
          "dotdashed"         ----   -   ----   -   ----   -
          "shortdashed"       ----    ----    ----    ----
          "longdashed"        -------    -------    -------
          "dotdotdashed"      ----   -   -   ----   -   -
          "dotdotdotdashed"   ----   -   -   -   ----   -   -   -
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">In&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> preceding patterns, each hyphen stands for one line
thickness.  This is the case for sufficiently thick lines, at&nbsp;least<!-- /@w -->. 
So&nbsp;for<!-- /@w --> sufficiently thick lines, the distance over which a dash
pattern repeats is scaled proportionately to the line thickness.

     <p>The "disconnected" line style is special.  A "disconnected" path is
rendered as a set of filled circles, each of which has diameter equal to
the nominal line thickness.  One of these circles is centered on each of
the juncture points of the path (i.e., the endpoints of the line
segments or arcs from which it is constructed).  Circles and ellipses
with "disconnected" line style are invisible.  Disconnected paths are
not filled; this includes circles and ellipses.

     <p>All line styles are supported by all Plotters, with the following
exceptions.  HP-GL Plotters do not support the "dotdotdotdashed" style
unless the parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is set to "2" (the default). 
Tektronix Plotters do not support the "dotdotdotdashed" style, and do
not support the "dotdotdashed" style unless the parameter <code>TERM</code> is
set to "kermit".  See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>linewidth</tt> (int <var>size</var>);<dt>int <tt>flinewidth</tt> (double <var>size</var>);<dd><tt>linewidth</tt> and <tt>flinewidth</tt> terminate and draws the path under
construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and set
the thickness, in the user coordinate system, of all paths subsequently
drawn on the graphics display.  A&nbsp;negative<!-- /@w --> value resets the
thickness to the default.  The default thickness depends on the type of
Plotter.  For most Plotters, it is 1/850 times the size of the viewport,
i.e., the drawn-on portion of the display.  (Here `size' means minimum
dimension.)  But for Plotters that produce bitmaps, i.e., X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters, PNG Plotters, PNM Plotters, and GIF
Plotters, it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> zero.

     <p>By convention, a zero-thickness line is the thinnest line that can be
drawn.  However, the drawing editors <code>idraw</code> and <code>xfig</code> treat
zero-thickness lines as invisible.  So&nbsp;when<!-- /@w --> producing editable
graphics with a Postscript or Fig Plotter, using a zero line thickness
may not be desirable.

     <p>Tektronix and ReGIS Plotters do not support drawing with other than a
default thickness, and HP-GL Plotters do not support doing so if the
parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is set to a value less than&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the
default; see <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>).

     <p><strong>Warning</strong>: If the transformation from the user coordinate system
to the device coordinate system is anisotropic, each line segment in a
polygonal path should ideally be drawn on the graphics display with a
thickness that depends on its direction.  But currently, only SVG and
Postscript Plotters do&nbsp;this<!-- /@w -->.  Other Plotters draw all line segments
in a path with the same thickness.  The thickness that is used is the
minimum thickness, in the device coordinate system, that can correspond
to the specified line thickness in the user coordinate system.

     <br><dt>int <tt>move</tt> (int <var>x</var>, int <var>y</var>);<dt>int <tt>fmove</tt> (double <var>x</var>, double <var>y</var>);<dt>int <tt>moverel</tt> (int <var>x</var>, int <var>y</var>);<dt>int <tt>fmoverel</tt> (double <var>x</var>, double <var>y</var>);<dd><tt>move</tt> and <tt>fmove</tt> take two arguments specifying the coordinates
(<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) of a point to which the graphics cursor should be
moved.  The path under construction (if&nbsp;any)<!-- /@w --> is ended and drawn, as
if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and the graphics cursor is moved to
(<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>).  This is equivalent to lifting the pen on a plotter
and moving it to a new position, without drawing any line.  <tt>moverel</tt>
and <tt>fmoverel</tt> are similar to <tt>move</tt> and <tt>fmove</tt>, but use
cursor-relative coordinates.

     <p>When a new page of graphics is begun by invoking <tt>openpl</tt>, the cursor
is initially at the point (0,0) in user space.  Most of the drawing
functions reposition the cursor.  See <a href="Drawing-Functions.html#Drawing-Functions">Drawing Functions</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>orientation</tt> (int <var>direction</var>);<dd><tt>orientation</tt> sets the orientation for all circles, ellipses, and
boxes subsequently drawn on the graphics display.  <var>direction</var> must
be&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->, meaning counterclockwise, or&nbsp;&minus;1<!-- /@w -->, meaning clockwise. 
The default is&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->.

     <p><tt>orientation</tt> will have a visible effect on a circle, ellipse, or box
only if it is dashed, or if it is one of the simple paths in a filled
compound path.  Its effects on filling, when the "nonzero-winding" fill
rule is used, are dramatic, since it is the orientation of each simple
path in a compound path that determines which points are `inside' and
which are `outside'.

     <br><dt>int <tt>pencolor</tt> (int <var>red</var>, int <var>green</var>, int <var>blue</var>);<dd><tt>pencolor</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the pen color for all
objects subsequently drawn on the graphics display, using a 48-bit RGB
color model.  The arguments <var>red</var>, <var>green</var> and <var>blue</var>
specify the red, green and blue intensities of the pen color.  Each is
an integer in the range <tt>0x0000</tt><small class="dots">...</small><tt>0xffff</tt>, i.e.,
0<small class="dots">...</small>65535.  The choice (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0)<!-- /@w --> signifies black, and the choice
(65535, 65535, 65535) signifies white.

     <p>HP-GL Plotters support drawing with a white pen only if the value of the
parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default), and the value of
the parameter <code>HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE</code> is "yes" (the default). 
See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.

     <br><dt>int <tt>pencolorname</tt> (const char *<var>name</var>);<dd><tt>pencolorname</tt> sets the pen color of all objects subsequently drawn on
the graphics display to be <var>name</var>.  Unrecognized colors are
interpreted as "black".  For information on what color names are
recognized, see <a href="Color-Names.html#Color-Names">Color Names</a>.  A&nbsp;24-bit<!-- /@w --> RGB color may also be
specified as a six-digit hexadecimal string, e.g., "#c0c0c0".

     <p>HP-GL Plotters support drawing with a white pen only if the value of the
parameter <code>HPGL_VERSION</code> is&nbsp;"2"<!-- /@w --> (the default) and the value of

     <br><dt>int <tt>pentype</tt> (int <var>level</var>);<dd><tt>pentype</tt> terminates and draws the path under construction (if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->), as if <tt>endpath</tt> had been called, and sets the pen level for all
subsequently drawn paths.  A&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> of&nbsp;1<!-- /@w --> for <var>level</var>
specifies that an outline of each of these objects should be drawn, in
the color previously specified by calling <tt>pencolor</tt> or
<tt>pencolorname</tt>.  This is the default.  A&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> of&nbsp;0<!-- /@w --> specifies
that outlines should not be drawn.

     <p>To draw the region bounded by a path in an edgeless way, you would call
<tt>pentype</tt> to turn&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> the drawing of the boundary, and
<tt>filltype</tt> to turn&nbsp;on<!-- /@w --> the filling of the interior.

     <p><tt>pentype</tt> also affects the drawing of marker symbols and points, i.e.,
pixels.  A&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> of&nbsp;0<!-- /@w --> specifies that they should not be drawn.

     <p><strong>Note</strong>: In future releases, <tt>pentype</tt> may also affect the
drawing of text strings (a&nbsp;value<!-- /@w --> of&nbsp;0<!-- /@w --> will specify that they
should not be drawn).  It&nbsp;already<!-- /@w --> affects text strings that are
rendered using Hershey fonts, since they are drawn using polygonal
paths.

     <br><dt>int <tt>restorestate</tt> ();<dd><tt>restorestate</tt> pops the current graphics context off the stack of
drawing states.  The graphics context consists largely of
<code>libplot</code>'s drawing attributes, which are set by the attribute
functions documented in this section.  So popping&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> the graphics
context restores the drawing attributes to values they previously had. 
A&nbsp;path<!-- /@w --> under construction is regarded as part of the graphics
context.  For this reason, calling <tt>restorestate</tt> automatically calls
<tt>endpath</tt> to terminate and draw the path under construction, if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->.  All graphics contexts on the stack are popped&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> when
<code>closepl</code> is called, as&nbsp;if<!-- /@w --> <code>restorestate</code> had been called
repeatedly.

     <br><dt>int <tt>savestate</tt> ();<dd><tt>savestate</tt> pushes the current graphics context onto the stack of
drawing states.  The graphics context consists largely of
<code>libplot</code>'s drawing attributes, which are set by the attribute
functions documented in this section.  A&nbsp;path<!-- /@w --> under construction,
if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->, is regarded as part of the graphics context.  That is
because paths may be drawn incrementally, one line segment or arc at a
time.  The new graphics context created by <tt>savestate</tt> will contain no
path.  When the previous graphics context is returned&nbsp;to<!-- /@w --> by calling
<tt>restorestate</tt>, the path previously under construction may be
continued.

     <br><dt>int <tt>textangle</tt> (int <var>angle</var>);<dt>double <tt>ftextangle</tt> (double <var>angle</var>);<dd><tt>textangle</tt> and <tt>ftextangle</tt> take one argument, which specifies the
angle in degrees counterclockwise from the x (horizontal) axis in
the user coordinate system, for text strings subsequently drawn on the
graphics display.  The default angle is zero.  (The font for plotting
strings is fully specified by calling <tt>fontname</tt>, <tt>fontsize</tt>, and
<tt>textangle</tt>.)  The size of the font for plotting strings, in user
coordinates, is returned.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some X Window System displays do not generate or
display rotated fonts correctly.  In effect, they only support a zero
rotation angle.
