<h3 class="section">7.1 How to use <code>spline</code></h3>

<p>GNU <code>spline</code> is a program for interpolating between the data points
in one or more datasets.  Each dataset would consist of values for an
independent variable and a dependent variable, which may be a vector of
specified fixed length.  When discussing interpolation, we call these
variables `t' and `y', respectively.  To&nbsp;emphasize:<!-- /@w -->
t&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scalar<!-- /@w -->, but in&nbsp;general<!-- /@w --> the dependent variable
y&nbsp;may<!-- /@w --> be a vector.

   <p>The simplest case is when there is a single input file, which is in
ASCII format, and the vector&nbsp;y<!-- /@w --> is one-dimensional.  This is
the default.  For example, the input file could contain the dataset

<pre class="example">     0.0  0.0
     1.0  1.0
     2.0  0.0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which are the coordinates (t,y) of the data points (0,0), (1,1),
and (2,0).  Data points do not need to be on different lines, nor do the
t and&nbsp;y<!-- /@w --> coordinates of a data point need to be on the
same line.  However, there should be no blank lines in the input if it
is to be viewed as forming a single dataset.  Also, by&nbsp;default<!-- /@w --> the
t coordinate should be monotonically increasing, so that
y&nbsp;may<!-- /@w --> be viewed as a function of&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.

   <p>You would construct a spline (the graph of an `interpolating function')
passing through the points in this dataset by doing

<pre class="example">     spline input_file &gt; output_file
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To produce a Postscript plot of the spline with the <code>graph</code>
utility, you would do

<pre class="example">     spline input_file | graph -T ps &gt; output.ps
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To display a spline on an X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System display, you could do

<pre class="example">     echo 0 0 1 1 2 0 | spline | graph -T X
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice that the last example avoids the use of the input file
altogether.  <code>spline</code> will read from standard input if no files are
specified on the command line, or if the special file name&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
is specified.

   <p>What exactly does <code>spline</code> do?  First, it fits a curve (the graph
of an interpolating function) through the points in the dataset.  Then
it splits the interval over which the independent variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->
ranges into 100 sub-intervals, and computes the y&nbsp;values<!-- /@w --> at
each of the 101 subdivision points.  It&nbsp;then<!-- /@w --> outputs each of the
pairs (t, y).  These are the coordinates of 101 points that lie
along a curve that interpolates between the points in the dataset.  If
there is more than one dataset in the input (separated by blank lines),
each dataset is interpolated separately.

   <p>You may use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo; option to replace `100' by any other positive
integer.  You may also use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo; option to specify an
interpolation interval that differs from the default (the interval over
which the independent variable ranges).  For example, the command

<pre class="example">     echo 0 0 1 1 2 0 | spline -n 20 -t 1.0 1.5 &gt; output_file
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will produce a dataset consisting of 21 (rather than 101) data points,
with t&nbsp;values<!-- /@w --> spaced regularly between 1.0 and 1.5 (rather
than between 0.0 and 2.0).  The data points will lie along a curve
passing through (0,0), (1,1), and (2,0).  This curve will be a parabola.

   <p>In general, the interpolating function will be a piecewise cubic spline. 
That is, between each pair of adjacent `knots' (points in the input
dataset), y&nbsp;will<!-- /@w --> be a cubic function of&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.  This
function will differ, depending on which pair of knots y&nbsp;lies<!-- /@w -->
between.  At each knot, both the slope and curvature of the cubic pieces
to either side will match.  In mathematical terms, the interpolating
curve will be twice continuously differentiable.

   <p><code>spline</code> supports `adding tension' to the interpolating curve. 
A&nbsp;nonzero<!-- /@w --> value for the tension can be specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T</span></samp>&rsquo;
option.  For example, a spline under considerable tension can be
computed and displayed by doing

<pre class="example">     echo 0 0 1 0 2 0 | spline -T 10 | graph -T X
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As the tension parameter is increased to positive infinity, the spline
will converge to a polygonal line.  You are meant to think of the spline
as being drawn taut.  Actually, tension may be negative as&nbsp;well<!-- /@w --> as
positive.  A&nbsp;spline<!-- /@w --> with negative tension will tend to bow outward,
in&nbsp;fact<!-- /@w --> to oscillate sinusoidally.  But as the tension decreases to
negative infinity, the spline, though oscillatory, will again converge
to a polygonal line.

   <p>If the tension is positive, its reciprocal will be the maximum range of
the independent variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w --> over which the spline will `like
to curve'.  Increasing the tension far above zero will accordingly force
the spline to consist of short curved sections, centered on the data
points, and sections that are almost straight.  It follows that tension
is a `dimensionful' quantity.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> tension is nonzero, then when
the values of the independent variable are multiplied by some common
positive factor, the tension should be divided by the same factor to
obtain a scaled version of the original spline.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> tension is
zero (the default, or cubic spline case), then the computation of the
spline will be unaffected by linear scaling of the data.

   <p>In mathematical terms, a spline under tension will satisfy the
differential equation
y&rdquo;&rdquo;=sgn(tension)*(tension^2)y&rdquo;
between each successive pair of knots.  If the tension equals zero,
which is the default, the fourth derivative of y with respect
to&nbsp;t<!-- /@w --> will equal zero at every point.  In this case, y
as a function of&nbsp;t<!-- /@w --> will reduce to a cubic polynomial between
each successive pair of knots.  But if the tension is nonzero, y
will not be a polynomial function of&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.  It&nbsp;may<!-- /@w --> be expressed
in&nbsp;terms<!-- /@w --> of exponential functions, however.

   <p>Irrespective of whether or not the spline is under tension, you may
specify the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; option if you wish the spline to be a periodic
function of&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.  This will only work if the y values for
the first and last points in the dataset are equal.  Otherwise, it would
make no sense to compute a periodic interpolation.

   <p>It is sometimes useful to interpolate between data points at the same
time as they are generated by an auxiliary program.  That&nbsp;is<!-- /@w -->, it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> useful for <code>spline</code> to function as a real-time filter. 
<code>spline</code> does not normally act as a filter, since computing an
interpolating curve that is as smooth as possible is a global task.  But
if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; option is specified, <code>spline</code> will indeed function
as a filter.  A&nbsp;different<!-- /@w --> interpolation algorithm (cubic Bessel
interpolation, which is local rather than global) will be used.  If&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is specified, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; may not be specified.  Also, if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; is specified then an interpolation interval (a&nbsp;range<!-- /@w --> of
t&nbsp;values<!-- /@w -->) must be requested explicitly with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo;
option.

   <p>Cubic Bessel interpolation is inherently less smooth than the
construction of a global cubic spline.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; option is
specified, the slope of the spline at each knot will be chosen by
fitting a parabola through that knot, and the two adjacent knots.  The
slopes of the two interpolating segments to either side of each interior
knot will match at that knot, but typically their curvatures will not. 
In mathematical terms, the interpolating curve will be continuously
differentiable, but in general not twice continuously differentiable. 
This loss of differentiability is the price that is paid for functioning
as a real-time filter.
