<h3 class="section">8.3 Additional examples using <code>ode</code></h3>

<p>We explain here how to use some additional features of <code>ode</code>. 
However, the discussion below does not cover all of its capabilities. 
For a complete list of command-line options, see <a href="ode-Invocation.html#ode-Invocation">ode Invocation</a>.

   <p>It is easy to use <code>ode</code> to create plots of great beauty.  An
example would be a plot of a <em>strange attractor</em>, namely the Lorenz
attractor.  Suppose that a file named <samp><span class="file">lorenz</span></samp> contains the
following lines.

<pre class="example">     # The Lorenz model, a system of three coupled ODE's with parameter r.
     x' = -3*(x-y)
     y' = -x*z+r*x-y
     z' = x*y-z
     
     r = 26
     x = 0; y = 1; z = 0
     
     print x, y
     step 0, 200
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then executing the command

<pre class="example">     ode &lt; lorenz | graph -T X -C -x -10 10 -y -10 10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would produce a plot of the Lorenz attractor (strictly speaking, a&nbsp;plot<!-- /@w --> of one of its two-dimensional projections).  You may produce a
Postscript plot of the Lorenz attractor, and print it, by doing
something like

<pre class="example">     ode &lt; lorenz | graph -T ps -x -10 10 -y -10 10 -W 0 | lpr
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W 0</span></samp>&rsquo; (&ldquo;zero width&rdquo;) option requests that <code>graph -T ps</code>
use the thinnest line possible, to improve the visual appearance of the
plot on a printer or other Postscript device.

   <p>Besides plotting a visually striking object in real time, the Lorenz
attractor example shows how statements may be separated by semicolons,
rather than appearing on different lines.  It&nbsp;also<!-- /@w --> shows how to use
symbolic constants.  In&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> description read by <code>ode</code> the
parameter&nbsp;r<!-- /@w --> is a variable like x, y, and&nbsp;z<!-- /@w -->.  But unlike them it is not updated during stepping, since no
formula for its derivative&nbsp;r'<!-- /@w --> is given.

   <p>Our second example deals with the interactive construction of a `phase
portrait': a&nbsp;set<!-- /@w --> of solution curves with different initial
conditions.  Phase portraits are of paramount interest in the
qualitative theory of differential equations, and also possess
&aelig;sthetic appeal.

   <p>Since a description read by <code>ode</code> may contain any number of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; statements, multiple solution curves may be plotted in a
single run.  The most recent &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print</span></samp>&rsquo; statement will be used with
each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; statement.  In&nbsp;practice<!-- /@w -->, a phase portrait would be
drawn from a few well-chosen solution curves.  Choosing a good set of
solution curves may require experimentation, which makes interactivity
and real-time plotting all-important.

   <p>As an example, consider a so-called Lotka&ndash;Volterra predator&ndash;prey
model.  Suppose that in a lake there are two species of fish: A&nbsp;(the&nbsp;prey)<!-- /@w --> who live by eating a plentiful supply of plants, and B (the
predator) who eat&nbsp;A<!-- /@w -->.  Let x(t) be the population of&nbsp;A<!-- /@w -->
and y(t) the population of&nbsp;B<!-- /@w --> at time&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.  A&nbsp;crude<!-- /@w --> model for the interaction of A and&nbsp;B<!-- /@w --> is given by the
equations

<pre class="example">     x' = x(a-by)
     y' = y(cx-d)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where a, b, c, d are positive constants.  To draw a phase
portrait for this system interactively, you could type

<pre class="example">     ode | graph -T X -C -x 0 5 -y 0 5
     x' = (a - b*y) * x
     y' = (c*x - d) * y
     a = 1; b = 1; c = 1; d = 1;
     print x, y
     x = 1; y = 2
     step 0, 10
     x = 1; y = 3
     step 0, 10
     x = 1; y = 4
     step 0, 10
     x = 1; y = 5
     step 0, 10
     .
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Four curves will be drawn in succession, one per &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; line.  They
will be periodic; this periodicity is similar to the fluctuations
between predator and prey populations that occur in real-world
ecosystems.  On&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> color display the curves will appear in different
colors, since by&nbsp;default<!-- /@w -->, <code>graph</code> changes the linemode between
datasets.  That feature may be turned&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> by using <code>graph -T X
-B</code> rather than <code>graph -T&nbsp;X<!-- /@w --></code>.

   <p>It is sometimes useful to use <code>ode</code> and <code>graph</code> to plot
discrete points, which are not joined by line segments to form a curve. 
Our third example illustrates this.  Suppose the file <samp><span class="file">atwoods</span></samp>
contains the lines

<pre class="example">     m = 1
     M = 1.0625
     a = 0.5; adot = 0
     l = 10; ldot = 0
     
     ldot' = ( m * l * adot * adot - M * 9.8 + m * 9.8 * cos(a) ) / (m + M)
     l'    = ldot
     adot' = (-1/l) * (9.8 * sin(a) +  2 * adot * ldot)
     a'    = adot
     
     print l, ldot
     step 0, 400
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first few lines describe the functioning of a so-called swinging
Atwood's machine.  An ordinary Atwood's machine consists of a taut cord
draped over a pulley, with a mass attached to the cord at each end. 
Normally, the heavier mass&nbsp;(M)<!-- /@w --> would win against the lighter
mass&nbsp;(m)<!-- /@w -->, and draw it upward.  A&nbsp;swinging<!-- /@w --> Atwood's
machine allows the lighter mass to swing back and forth as&nbsp;well<!-- /@w --> as
move vertically.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print l, ldot</span></samp>&rsquo; statement requests that the vertical position
and vertical velocity of the lighter mass be printed out at each step. 
If&nbsp;you<!-- /@w --> run the command

<pre class="example">     ode &lt; atwoods | graph -T X -x 9 11 -y -1 1 -m 0 -S 1 -X l -Y ldot
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">you will obtain a real-time plot.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m 0</span></samp>&rsquo; option requests that
successive data points not be joined by line segments, and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-S
1</span></samp>&rsquo; option requests that plotting symbol&nbsp;#1<!-- /@w --> (a&nbsp;dot<!-- /@w -->) be plotted at
the location of each point.  As you will see if you run this command,
the heavy mass does not win against the lighter mass.  Instead the
machine oscillates non-periodically.  Since the motion is non-periodic,
the plot benefits from being drawn as a sequence of unconnected points.

   <p>We conclude by mentioning a few features of <code>ode</code> that may be
useful when things are not going quite right.  One of them is the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">examine</span></samp>&rsquo; statement.  It&nbsp;may<!-- /@w --> be used to discover pertinent
information about any variable in a system.  For details, see <a href="Input-Language.html#Input-Language">Input Language</a>.

   <p>Another useful feature is that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print</span></samp>&rsquo; statement may be used to
print out more than just the value of a variable.  As we have seen, if
the name of the variable is followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;, the derivative of the
variable will be printed instead.  In&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> similar way, following the
variable name with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; prints respectively
the relative single-step error, the absolute single-step error, or the
accumulated error (not currently implemented).  These quantities are
discussed in <a href="Numerical-Error.html#Numerical-Error">Numerical Error</a>.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print</span></samp>&rsquo; statement may be more complicated than was shown in the
preceding examples.  Its general structure is

<pre class="example">     print &lt;pr-list&gt; [every &lt;const&gt;] [from &lt;const&gt;]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The bracket notation &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the enclosed statements
are optional.  Until now we have not mentioned the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">every</span></samp>&rsquo; clause
or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">from</span></samp>&rsquo; clause.  The <tt>&lt;pr-list&gt;</tt> is familiar, however; it
is simply a comma-separated list of variables.  For example, in the
statement

<pre class="example">     print t, y, y' every 5 from 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the <tt>&lt;pr-list&gt;</tt> is <tt>&lt;t, y, y'&gt;</tt>.  The clauses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">every 5</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">from 1</span></samp>&rsquo; specify that printing should take place after every fifth
step, and that the printing should begin when the independent
variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w --> reaches&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->.  An&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">every</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> clause is
useful if you wish to `thin&nbsp;out<!-- /@w -->' the output generated by a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; statement, and a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">from</span></samp>&rsquo; clause is useful if you wish to
view only the final portion of a solution curve.
