<h2 class="appendix">Appendix F History and Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Several of the GNU plotting utilities were inspired by Unix plotting
utilities.  A <code>graph</code> utility and various plot filters were present
in the first releases of Unix from Bell Laboratories, going at&nbsp;least<!-- /@w -->
as far back as the Version&nbsp;4<!-- /@w --> distribution (1973).  The first
supported display device was a Tektronix 611 storage scope.  Most of the
work on tying the plot filters together and breaking out
device-dependent versions of <code>libplot</code> was performed by
<a href="mailto:llc@research.att.com">Lorinda Cherry</a>. 
By&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> time of Version&nbsp;7<!-- /@w --> Unix (1979) and the subsequent Berkeley
releases, the package consisting of <code>graph</code>, <code>plot</code>,
<code>spline</code>, and several device-dependent versions of <code>libplot</code>
was a standard Unix feature.  Supported devices by the early 1980's
included Tektronix storage scopes, early graphics terminals,
200<span class="dmn">dpi</span> electrostatic printer/plotters from Versatec and Varian,
and pen plotters from Hewlett&ndash;Packard.

   <p>In 1989, <a href="mailto:rich@freebsd.org">Rich Murphey</a> wrote the first GNU
versions of <code>graph</code>, <code>plot</code>, and <code>spline</code>, and the
earliest documentation.  Richard Stallman further directed development
of the programs and provided editorial support for the documentation. 
<a href="mailto:interran@uluru.stanford.edu">John Interrante</a>, then of the
InterViews team at Stanford, generously provided the <code>idraw</code>
Postscript prologue now included in <code>libplot</code>, and helpful
comments.  The package as it stood in 1991 was distributed under the
name `GNU graphics'.

   <p>In 1995 <a href="mailto:rsm@math.arizona.edu">Robert S. Maier</a> took over
development of the package, and designed and wrote the current,
maximally device-independent, standalone version of <code>libplot</code>. 
He also rewrote <code>graph</code> from scratch, turning it into a real-time
filter that would use the new library.  He fleshed out <code>spline</code>
too, by adding support for splines in tension, periodicity, and cubic
Bessel interpolation.

   <p><code>libplot</code> now incorporates the X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System code for
filling polygons and drawing wide polygonal lines and arcs.  The code
is used when producing output in bitmap formats (e.g., PNG, PNM, and
pseudo-GIF).  It&nbsp;was<!-- /@w --> written by Brian Kelleher, Joel McCormack,
Todd Newman, Keith Packard, Robert Scheifler and Ken Whaley, who
worked for Digital Equipment Corp., MIT, and/or the X&nbsp;Consortium<!-- /@w -->,
and is copyright &copy; 1985&ndash;89 by the X&nbsp;Consortium<!-- /@w -->. 
Affinely transformed text strings are now generated and displayed by a
technique similar to that used by Alan Richardson in his
<code>xvertext</code> package, for displaying rotated strings.

   <p>The pseudo-GIF support now in <code>libplot</code> uses the `miGIF'
run-length encoding routines developed by
<a href="mailto:mouse@rodents.montreal.qc.ca">der Maus</a> and ivo which are
copyright &copy; 1998 by Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation. 
The copyright notice and permission notice for the miGIF routines are
distributed with the source code distribution of the plotting
utilities.

   <p>Most development work on <code>ode</code> was performed by
<a href="mailto:nbt@reed.edu">Nick Tufillaro</a> in 1978&ndash;1994, on a sequence of
platforms that extended back to a PDP-11 running Version&nbsp;4<!-- /@w --> Unix.  In
1997 Robert Maier modified his 1994 version to agree with GNU
conventions on coding and command-line parsing, extended it to support
the full set of special functions supported by <code>gnuplot</code>, and
extended the exception handling.

   <p>Many other people aided the development of the plotting utilities
package along the way.  The Hershey vector fonts now in <code>libplot</code>
are of&nbsp;course<!-- /@w --> based on the characters digitized in the mid to late
1960's by Allen&nbsp;V.<!-- /@w --> Hershey, who deserves a vote of thanks. 
Additional characters and/or marker symbols were taken from the SLAC
Unified Graphics System developed by Robert&nbsp;C.<!-- /@w --> Beach in the
mid-1970's, and from the fonts designed by
<a href="mailto:wolff@inf.fu-berlin.de">Thomas Wolff</a> for Ghostscript.  The
interpolation algorithms used in <code>spline</code> are based on the
algorithms of <a href="mailto:cline@cs.utexas.edu">Alan&nbsp;K.<!-- /@w --> Cline</a>, as
described in his papers in the Apr. 1974 issue of
<cite>Communications of the ACM</cite>.  The table-driven parser used in
<code>tek2plot</code> was written at Berkeley in the mid-1980's by
<a href="mailto:moy@parc.xerox.com">Edward Moy</a>.  The `sagitta' algorithm used
in an extended form in <code>libplot</code> for drawing circular and
elliptic arcs was developed by Peter Karow of URW and
<a href="mailto:turk@computer.org">Ken Turkowski</a> of Apple. 
<a href="mailto:raymond.toy@ericsson.com">Raymond Toy</a> helped with the tick mark
spacing code in <code>graph</code> and was the first to incorporate GNU
<code>getopt</code>.  Arthur Smith, formerly of LASSP at Cornell, provided
code for his <code>xplot</code> utility.  <a href="mailto:beebe@math.utah.edu">Nelson Beebe</a> exhaustively tested the package installation process.

   <p>Robert Maier wrote the documentation, which now incorporates Nick
Tufillaro's <code>ode</code> manual.  Julie Sussmann checked over the
documentation for style and clarity.
