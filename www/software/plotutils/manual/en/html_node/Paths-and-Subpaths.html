<h4 class="subsection">9.2.5 Simple paths and compound paths</h4>

<p>The most sophisticated sort of graphical object that <code>libplot</code> can
draw is a <em>path</em>.  In this section we explain the fine details of
constructing paths.  The other three sorts of graphical object (text
strings, marker symbols, and points [i.e., pixels]) are discussed
elsewhere.

   <p>As in Postscript, paths may be simple or compound.  A&nbsp;simple<!-- /@w --> path is
a contiguous sequence of line segments, circular arcs, elliptic arcs,
quadratic Bezier curves, and/or cubic Bezier curves.  A&nbsp;simple<!-- /@w --> path
may also be a circle, an ellipse, or a rectangle.  A&nbsp;compound<!-- /@w --> path
consists of one or more simple paths, which must be <em>nested</em>: they
should not intersect each other.  <em>This is more restrictive than in
Postscript.</em>

   <p><code>libplot</code>'s drawing model is significantly different from
Postscript's, and is more user-friendly.  Before drawing a path by
invoking <code>libplot</code> operations, you do not need to call any special
function.  You would specify the attributes of the path before drawing,
however.  Attributes include pen color, line type, line width, cap type,
join type, and miter limit.  If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> path is to be filled, the fill
color and fill rule would be specified too.  All these attributes are
`modal': their values are preserved from path to path.

   <p>In principle, you would end any path you construct, and request that it
be drawn on the graphics display, by invoking the <code>endpath</code>
operation.  But <code>endpath</code> is called automatically when any
path-related attribute is changed, when <code>move</code> is called to change
the graphics cursor position, and before any other object is constructed
and drawn.  It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> also called at the end of each page of graphics,
i.e., when <code>closepl</code> is invoked.  So invoking <code>endpath</code>
explicitly is usually unnecessary.  This is quite different from
Postscript, where an explicit command to stroke or fill a path is
required.

   <p><code>libplot</code> also differs from Postscript in the way it constructs and
draws compound paths.  In <code>libplot</code>, you would end each of the
constituent simple paths of a compound path by invoking the
<code>endsubpath</code> operation.  After all simple paths are drawn, the
compound path as a whole would be drawn by invoking <code>endpath</code>. 
After each of the calls to <code>endsubpath</code>, you are allowed to call
<code>move</code> to reposition the graphics cursor, prior to beginning the
next simple path.  Immediately after an invocation of <code>endsubpath</code>,
a call to <code>move</code> will not automatically invoke <code>endpath</code>.

   <p>The following sample program uses a Postscript Plotter to produce
Postscript output.  It draws a typical compound path, which consists of
17&nbsp;simple<!-- /@w --> paths.  The first simple path is a large box.  This box
contains 7&nbsp;circles<!-- /@w -->, nested within each other, and a separate set of
7&nbsp;circles<!-- /@w --> that are also nested within each other.  Within each of
the two sets of nested circles is a pair of contiguous line segments,
which make up an additional simple path.  The compound path is drawn in
green, and it is filled.  The fill color is light blue.

   <p>As you will see if you run this program, the filling of the compound
path takes place in a visually pleasing way: alternating annular regions
are filled.  That is because <code>libplot</code>'s default fill rule is
"even-odd".  Since a compound path's constituent simple paths must
always be nested, it is easy for <code>libplot</code> to determine which
regions between them are `even' and which are `odd'.  It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> the
latter that are filled.

   <p>The above program includes many invocations of <code>orientation</code>.  The
value of the modal `orientation' attribute (1,&nbsp;meaning<!-- /@w -->
counterclockwise, or&nbsp;&minus;1<!-- /@w -->, meaning clockwise) applies to
subsequently drawn boxes, circles, and ellipses.  If "even-odd" filling
is used, they have no effect.  But&nbsp;if<!-- /@w --> the fill rule for the compound
path is set to "nonzero-winding" by an initial call to <code>fillmod</code>,
these calls to <code>orientation</code> will arrange matters so that
alternating annular regions are filled, just as if "even-odd" filling
were used.

   <p>If the preceding paragraph is mysterious, it would be wise to consult a
good book on Postscript programming, or any other reference on the
subject of `winding numbers'.
