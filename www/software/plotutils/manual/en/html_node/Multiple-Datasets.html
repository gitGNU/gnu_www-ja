<h3 class="section">2.3 Preparing a plot from more than one dataset</h3>

<p>It is frequently the case that several datasets need to be displayed on
the same plot.  If&nbsp;so<!-- /@w -->, you may wish to distinguish the points in
different datasets by joining them by lines of different types, or by
using marker symbols of different types.

   <p>A more complicated example would be the following.  You may have a file
containing a dataset that is the result of experimental observations,
and a file containing closely spaced points that trace out a theoretical
curve.  The second file is a dataset in its own right.  You would
presumably plot it with line segments joining successive data points, so
as to trace out the theoretical curve.  But the first dataset, resulting
from experiment, would be plotted without such line segments.  In&nbsp;fact<!-- /@w -->, a marker symbol would be plotted at each of its points.

   <p>These examples, and others like them, led us to define a set of seven
<em>attributes</em> that define the way a dataset should be plotted. 
These attributes, which can be set by command-line options, are the
following.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>color/monochrome
<li>linemode
<li>linewidth
<li>symbol type
<li>symbol size
<li>symbol font name
<li>fill fraction
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">Color/monochrome (a choice of one or the other) is the simplest.  The
choice is toggled with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-C</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  The `linemode' (i.e., line
style) specifies how the line segments joining successive points should
be drawn; it is specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  Linemode #0 means
no linemode at&nbsp;all<!-- /@w -->, for&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->.  `Linewidth' means line
thickness; it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo; option. `Symbol type'
and `symbol size', which are specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-S</span></samp>&rsquo; option,
specify the symbol plotted at each point of the dataset.  `Symbol font
name' refers to the font from which marker symbols #32 and above, which
are taken to be characters rather than geometric symbols, are selected. 
It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> set with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--symbol-font-name</span></samp>&rsquo; option, and is relevant
only if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-S</span></samp>&rsquo; is used to request such special marker symbols. 
Finally, the polygonal line joining the points in a dataset may be
<em>filled</em>, to create a filled or shaded polygon.  The `fill
fraction' is set with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  A&nbsp;negative<!-- /@w --> fill
fraction means no fill, or transparent; zero means white, and 1.0 means
solid, or fully colored.

   <p>The preceding seven attributes refer to the way in which datasets are
plotted.  Datasets may also differ from one another in the way in which
they are read from files.  The dataset(s) in a file may or may not
contain error bars, for&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->.  If&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> file contains data with
error bars, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I e</span></samp>&rsquo; option should occur on the command line
before the file name.  (The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo; option specifies the input format
for the following files.)

   <p>The following illustrates how datasets in three different input files
could be plotted simultaneously.

<pre class="example">     graph -T ps -m 0 -S 3 file1 -C -m 3 file2 -C -W 0.02 file3 &gt; output.ps
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The dataset in <code>file1</code> will be plotted in linemode #0, so
successive points will not be joined by lines.  But symbol #3 (an
asterisk) will be plotted at each point.  The dataset in <code>file2</code>
will be plotted in color, and linemode #3 will be used.  In color
plotting, linemode #3 is interpreted as a solid blue line.  The second
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-C</span></samp>&rsquo; on the command line turns off color for <code>file3</code>.  The
points in the third dataset will be joined by a black line with
thickness 0.02, as a fraction of the size (i.e., minimum dimension) of
the graphics display.

   <p>The above command line could be made even more complicated by specifying
additional options (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo;) before each file. 
In&nbsp;fact<!-- /@w --> the command line could also include such standard options as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-y</span></samp>&rsquo;, which specify the range of each axis.  Such
options, which refer to the plot as a whole rather than to individual
datasets, should appear before the first file name.  For&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->,
you could do

<pre class="example">     graph -T ps -x 0 1 0.5 -m 0 -S 3 file1 -C -m 3 file2 &gt; output.ps
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that it is possible to include the special file name&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->,
which refers to standard input, on the command line.  So you may pipe
the output of another program into <code>graph</code>.  You may even generate
a plot in&nbsp;part<!-- /@w --> from piped output, and in&nbsp;part<!-- /@w --> from files.

   <p>Each input file may include more than one dataset.  If so, the command
line options preceding a file on the command line will take effect for
all datasets in that file.  There are two exceptions to this.  By&nbsp;default<!-- /@w -->, the linemode is incremented (`bumped') from one dataset to the
next.  This feature is usually quite convenient.  For&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->, if
you do

<pre class="example">     graph -T ps -m 3 file1 &gt; output.ps
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the first dataset in <code>file1</code> will appear in linemode #3, the second
in linemode #4, etc.  In&nbsp;fact<!-- /@w -->, if you do

<pre class="example">     graph -T ps file1 file2 ... &gt; output.ps
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">without specifying linemode explicitly, the successive datasets read
from the files on the command line will appear in linemode #1, linemode
#2, <small class="dots">...</small>.  If&nbsp;you<!-- /@w --> do not like this feature, you may turn it
off, or in general toggle&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->, by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-B</span></samp>&rsquo; option.

   <p>You may also control manually the linemode and symbol type used for the
datasets within any file.  You would do this by including directives in
the file itself, rather than on the command line.  For example, if the
line

<pre class="example">     #m=-5,S=10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">appeared in an ASCII-format input file, it would be interpreted as a
directive to switch to linemode #&minus;5 and symbol type #10 for the
following dataset.  Future releases of <code>graph</code> may provide the
ability to set each of the seven dataset attributes in this way.
