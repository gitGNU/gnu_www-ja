<h3 class="section">8.2 Simple examples using <code>ode</code></h3>

<p>The following examples should illustrate the procedure of stating an
initial value problem and solving it with <code>ode</code>.  If&nbsp;these<!-- /@w -->
examples are too elementary, see <a href="Input-Language.html#Input-Language">Input Language</a>, for a formal
specification of the <code>ode</code> input language.  There is also a
directory containing examples of <code>ode</code> input, which is distributed
along with the GNU plotting utilities.  On&nbsp;most<!-- /@w --> systems it is
installed as <samp><span class="file">/usr/share/ode</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/ode</span></samp>.

   <p>Our first example is a simple one, namely

<pre class="example">     y'(t) = y(t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with the initial condition

<pre class="example">     y(0) = 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The solution to this differential equation is

<pre class="example">     y(t) = e^t.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In particular

<pre class="example">     y(1) = e^1 = 2.718282
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to seven digits of accuracy.

   <p>You may obtain this result with the aid of <code>ode</code> by typing on the
command line the sequence of commands

<pre class="example">     ode
     y' = y
     y = 1
     print t, y
     step 0, 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Two columns of numbers will appear.  Each line will show the value of
the independent variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->, and the value of the
variable&nbsp;y<!-- /@w -->, as t is `stepped' from 0 to&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->.  The
last line will be

<pre class="example">     1 2.718282
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">as expected.  You may use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; option to change the precision. 
If, for&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->, you type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ode -p 10</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ode</span></samp>&rsquo;,
you will get ten digits of accuracy in the output, rather than seven
(the default).

   <p>After the above output, <code>ode</code> will wait for further instructions. 
Entering for example the line

<pre class="example">     step 1, 0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">should yield two more columns of numbers, containing the values of
t and y that are computed when t&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> stepped
back from 1 to&nbsp;0<!-- /@w -->.  You could type instead

<pre class="example">     step 1, 2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to increase rather than decrease&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.  To&nbsp;exit<!-- /@w --> <code>ode</code>,
you would type a line containing only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, i.e. a&nbsp;single<!-- /@w --> period,
and tap `return'.  <code>ode</code> will also exit if it sees an end-of-file
indicator in its input stream, which you may send from your terminal by
typing control-D.

   <p>Each line of the preceding example should be self-explanatory.  A&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> statement sets the beginning and the end of an interval
over which the independent variable (here,&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->) will range, and
causes <code>ode</code> to set the numerical scheme in motion.  The initial
value appearing in the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; statement (i.e.,&nbsp;0<!-- /@w -->) and the
assignment statement

<pre class="example">     y = 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are equivalent to the initial condition y(0) = 1.  The statements
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y'&nbsp;=&nbsp;y</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y = 1</span></samp>&rsquo; are very different: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y' = y</span></samp>&rsquo;
defines a way of computing the derivative of&nbsp;y<!-- /@w -->, while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y
= 1</span></samp>&rsquo; sets the initial value of&nbsp;y<!-- /@w -->.  Whenever a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo;
statement is encountered, <code>ode</code> tries to step the independent
variable through the interval it specifies.  Which values are to be
printed at each step is specified by the most recent &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print</span></samp>&rsquo;
statement.  For&nbsp;example<!-- /@w -->,

<pre class="example">     print t, y, y'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would cause the current value of the independent variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->,
the variable&nbsp;y<!-- /@w -->, and its derivative to be printed at each
step.

   <p>To illustrate <code>ode</code>'s ability to take its input or the initial part
of its input from a file, you could prepare a file containing the
following lines:

<pre class="example">     # an ode to Euler
     y  = 1
     y' = y
     print t, y, y'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Call this file <samp><span class="file">euler</span></samp>.  (The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; line is a comment line,
which may appear at any point.  Everything from the&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> to the
end of the line on which it appears will be ignored.)  To&nbsp;process<!-- /@w -->
this file with <code>ode</code>, you could type on your terminal

<pre class="example">     ode -f euler
     step 0, 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These two lines cause <code>ode</code> to read the file <samp><span class="file">euler</span></samp>, and the
stepping to take place.  You will now get three quantities (t,
y, and y') printed at each of the values of&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->
between 0 and&nbsp;1<!-- /@w -->.  At&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> conclusion of the stepping, <code>ode</code>
will wait for any further commands to be input from the terminal.  This
example illustrates that

<pre class="example">     ode -f euler
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is not equivalent to

<pre class="example">     ode &lt; euler
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The latter would cause <code>ode</code> to take all its input from the file
<samp><span class="file">euler</span></samp>, while the former allows subsequent input from the
terminal.  For the latter to produce output, you would need to include a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; line at the end of the file.  You would not need to include
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; line, however.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> used to terminate input only
when input is being read from a terminal.

   <p>A second simple example involves the numerical solution of a
second-order differential equation.  Consider the initial value problem

<pre class="example">     y''(t) = -y(t)
     y(0) = 0
     y'(0) = 1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Its solution would be

<pre class="example">     y(t) = sin(t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To solve this problem using <code>ode</code>, you must express this
second-order equation as two first-order equations.  Toward this end you
would introduce a new function, called yp say, of the independent
variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->.  The pair of equations

<pre class="example">     y' = yp
     yp' = -y
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would be equivalent to the single equation above.  This sort of
reduction of an n'th order problem to n first order
problems is a standard technique.

   <p>To plot the variable y as a function of the variable&nbsp;t<!-- /@w -->, you could create a file containing the lines

<pre class="example">     # sine : y''(t) = -y(t), y(0) = 0, y'(0) = 1
     sine' = cosine
     cosine' = -sine
     sine = 0
     cosine = 1
     print t, sine
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(y and yp have been renamed <i>sine</i> and <i>cosine</i>, since
that is what they will be.)  Call this file <samp><span class="file">sine</span></samp>.  To display the
generated data points on an X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System display as they are
generated, you would type

<pre class="example">     ode -f sine | graph -T X -x 0 10 -y -1 1
     step 0, 2*PI
     .
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After you type the <code>ode</code> line, <code>graph -T&nbsp;X<!-- /@w --></code> will pop&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> a window, and after you type the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; line, the generated
dataset will be drawn in&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x 0 10</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-y -1 1</span></samp>&rsquo;
options, which set the bounds for the two axes, are necessary if you
wish to display points in real&nbsp;time<!-- /@w -->: as they are generated. 
If&nbsp;the<!-- /@w --> axis bounds were not specified on the command line,
<code>graph -T&nbsp;X<!-- /@w --></code> would wait until all points are read from the
input before determining the bounds, and drawing the plot.

   <p>A slight modification of this example, showing how <code>ode</code> can
generate several datasets in succession and plot them on the same graph,
would be the following.  Suppose that you type on your terminal the
following lines.

<pre class="example">     ode -f sine | graph -T X -C -x 0 10 -y -1 1
     step 0, PI
     step PI, 2*PI
     step 2*PI, 3*PI
     .
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then the sine curve will be traced out in three stages.  Since the
output from each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">step</span></samp>&rsquo; statement ends with a blank line,
<code>graph -T&nbsp;X<!-- /@w --></code> will treat each section of the sine curve as a
different dataset.  If you are using a color display, each of the three
sections will be plotted in a different color.  This is a feature
provided by <code>graph</code>, which normally changes its linemode after each
dataset it reads.  If you do not like this feature, you may turn it off
by using <code>graph -T X -B</code> instead of <code>graph -T&nbsp;X<!-- /@w --></code>.

   <p>In the above examples, you could use any of the other variants of
<code>graph</code> instead of <code>graph -T&nbsp;X<!-- /@w --></code>.  For example, you could use
<code>graph -T ps</code> to obtain a plot in encapsulated Postscript format,
by typing

<pre class="example">     ode -f sine | graph -T ps &gt; plot.ps
     step 0, 2*PI
     .
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You should note that of the variants of <code>graph</code>, the variants
<code>graph -T png</code>, <code>graph -T pnm</code>, <code>graph -T gif</code>,
<code>graph -T svg</code>, <code>graph -T ai</code>, <code>graph -T ps</code>, <code>graph
-T cgm</code>, <code>graph -T fig</code>, <code>graph -T pcl</code> and <code>graph -T
hpgl</code> do not produce output in real time, even when the axis bounds are
specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; and&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-y</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> options.  So&nbsp;if<!-- /@w --> any
of these variants is used, the plot will be produced only when input
from <code>ode</code> is terminated, which will occur when you type&nbsp;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.

   <p>In the preceding examples, the derivatives of the dependent variables
were specified by comparatively simple expressions.  They are allowed to
be arbitrarily complicated functions of the dependent variables and the
independent variable.  They may also involve any of the functions that
are built into <code>ode</code>.  <code>ode</code> has a fair number of functions
built&nbsp;in<!-- /@w -->, including <tt>abs</tt>, <tt>sqrt</tt>, <tt>exp</tt>, <tt>log</tt>, <tt>log10</tt>,
<tt>sin</tt>, <tt>cos</tt>, <tt>tan</tt>, <tt>asin</tt>, <tt>acos</tt>, <tt>atan</tt>, <tt>sinh</tt>,
<tt>cosh</tt>, <tt>tanh</tt>, <tt>asinh</tt>, <tt>acosh</tt>, and <tt>atanh</tt>.  Less familiar
functions which are built into&nbsp;it<!-- /@w --> are <tt>besj0</tt>, <tt>besj1</tt>,
<tt>besy0</tt>, <tt>besy1</tt>, <tt>erf</tt>, <tt>erfc</tt>, <tt>inverf</tt>, <tt>lgamma</tt>,
<tt>gamma</tt>, <tt>norm</tt>, <tt>invnorm</tt>, <tt>ibeta</tt>, and <tt>igamma</tt>.  These have
the same definitions as in the plotting program <code>gnuplot</code>.  (All
functions take a single argument, except for <tt>ibeta</tt>, which takes
three, and <tt>igamma</tt>, which takes two).  <code>ode</code> also knows the
meaning of the constant &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PI</span></samp>&rsquo;, as the above examples show.  The
names of the preceding functions are reserved, so, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cos</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin</span></samp>&rsquo; may not be used as names for variables.

   <p>Other than the restriction of avoiding reserved names and keywords, the
names of variables may be chosen arbitrarily.  Any sequence of
alphanumeric characters starting with an alphabetic character may be
used; the first 32 characters are significant.  It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> worth noting
that <code>ode</code> identifies the independent variable by the fact that it
is (or should be) the only variable that has not appeared on the left
side of a differential equation or an initial value assignment.  If&nbsp;there<!-- /@w --> is more than than one such variable then no stepping takes place;
instead, an error message is printed.  If&nbsp;there<!-- /@w --> is no such variable,
a&nbsp;dummy<!-- /@w --> independent variable is invented and given the name
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(indep)</span></samp>&rsquo;, internally.
