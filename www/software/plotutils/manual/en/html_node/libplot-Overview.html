<h3 class="section">9.1 Programming with <code>libplot</code>: An overview</h3>

<p>GNU <code>libplot</code> 4.4 is a free function library for drawing
two-dimensional vector graphics.  It can produce smooth,
double-buffered animations for the X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System, and can export
graphics files in many file formats.  It&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> `device-independent'
in the sense that its API (application programming interface) is to a
large extent independent of the output format.  The API is
thread-safe, so it may be used in multithreaded programs.

   <p>There are bindings for C, C++, and other languages.  The C&nbsp;binding<!-- /@w -->,
which is the most frequently used, is also called <code>libplot</code>, and
the C++ binding, when it needs to be distinguished, is called
<code>libplotter</code>.  In&nbsp;this<!-- /@w --> section we use <code>libplot</code> to refer
to the library itself, irrespective of binding.

   <p>The graphical objects that <code>libplot</code> can draw include paths,
`adjusted labels' (i.e., justified text strings), marker symbols, and
points (i.e., pixels).  Paths may be simple or compound.  A&nbsp;simple<!-- /@w -->
path is a contiguous sequence of line segments, circular arcs, elliptic
arcs, quadratic Bezier curves, and/or cubic Bezier curves.  A&nbsp;simple<!-- /@w -->
path may also be a circle, an ellipse, or a rectangle.  A&nbsp;compound<!-- /@w -->
path consists of one or more nested simple paths.  User-specified
filling of paths, both simple and compound, is supported (fill color and
fill rule, as&nbsp;well<!-- /@w --> as pen color, may be specified).

   <p>There is support for maintaining a Postscript-style stack of graphics
contexts, i.e., a&nbsp;stack<!-- /@w --> of drawing attribute sets.  Path-related
attributes include pen color, line thickness, line type, cap type, join
type, miter limit, fill color, fill rule, and transformation matrix, and
text-related attributes include font name, font size, text angle, and
transformation matrix.

   <p>The fundamental abstraction provided by <code>libplot</code> is that of a
<em>Plotter</em>.  A Plotter is an object with an interface for the
drawing of vector graphics which is similar to the interface provided by
a traditional pen plotter.  There are many types of Plotter, which
differ in the output format they produce.  Any number of Plotters, of
the same or different types, may exist simultaneously in an application.

   <p>The drawing operations supported by Plotters of different types are
identical, in agreement with the principle of device independence. 
So&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> graphics application that is linked with <code>libplot</code> may
easily be written so as to produce output in any or all of the
supported output formats.

   <p>The following are the currently supported types of Plotter.

     <ul>
<li>X Plotters.  An X Plotter, when opened, pops up a window on an X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System display and draws graphics in&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.  The window will be
`spun&nbsp;off<!-- /@w -->' when the Plotter is closed; if it is subsequently
reopened, a new window will be popped&nbsp;up<!-- /@w -->.  A spun-off window will
remain on the screen but will vanish if you type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; or click your
mouse in&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.  Future releases may permit X&nbsp;Plotters<!-- /@w -->, when
reopened, to reuse an existing window.

     <li>X Drawable Plotters.  An X Drawable Plotter draws graphics in one or two
specified drawables associated with an X&nbsp;Window&nbsp;System<!-- /@w --> display. 
A&nbsp;`drawable'<!-- /@w --> is either a window or a pixmap.  The drawables must be
passed to the Plotter as parameters.  (See <a href="Plotter-Parameters.html#Plotter-Parameters">Plotter Parameters</a>.)

     <li>PNG Plotters.  A PNG Plotter produces a single page of output in PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) format, and directs it to a file or other
specified output stream.  The file may be viewed or edited with many
applications, such as <code>display</code>, which is part of the free
<code>ImageMagick</code> package.

     <li>PNM Plotters.  A PNM Plotter produces a single page of output in
&ldquo;portable anymap&rdquo; format, and directs it to a file or other specified
output stream.  There are three types of portable anymap: PBM (portable
bitmap, for monochrome graphics), PGM (portable graymap), and PPM
(portable pixmap, for colored graphics).  The output file will be in
whichever of these three formats is most appropriate.  The file may be
viewed or edited with many applications, such as <code>display</code>.

     <li>GIF Plotters.  A GIF Plotter produces a single page of output in a
pseudo-GIF format.  Unlike true GIF format, the pseudo-GIF format does
not use LZW compression: it&nbsp;uses<!-- /@w --> run-length encoding instead. 
So&nbsp;it<!-- /@w --> does not transgress the Unisys patent that restricts the use
of LZW compression.  However, the output file may be viewed or edited
with any application that understands GIF format, such as
<code>display</code>.  The creation of animated pseudo-GIFs is supported.

     <li>SVG Plotters.  An SVG Plotter produces a single page of output in
Scalable Vector Graphics format and directs it to a file or other
specified output stream.  SVG is an XML-based format for vector
graphics on the Web, which is being developed by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics">Graphics Activity</a> of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org">W3&nbsp;Consortium<!-- /@w --></a>.  The output conforms to
the 3&nbsp;March<!-- /@w --> 2000 version of the SVG specification.

     <li>Illustrator Plotters.  An Illustrator Plotter produces a single page of
output in the format used by Adobe Illustrator, and directs it to a file
or other specified output stream.  The file may be edited with Adobe
Illustrator (version&nbsp;5<!-- /@w -->, and more recent versions), or other
applications.

     <li>Postscript Plotters.  A Postscript Plotter produces Postscript output
and directs it to a file or other specified output stream.  If only a
single page of graphics is drawn on the Plotter then its output is in
EPS (encapsulated Postscript) format, so it may be included in another
document.  It&nbsp;may<!-- /@w --> also be edited with the free <code>idraw</code> drawing
editor.  See <a href="idraw.html#idraw">idraw</a>.

     <li>CGM Plotters.  A CGM Plotter produces output in Computer Graphics
Metafile format and directs it to a file or other specified output
stream.  By default, binary-encoded version&nbsp;3<!-- /@w --> CGM format is used. 
The output complies with the WebCGM profile for Web-based vector
graphics, so it may be displayed in any Web browser with WebCGM support. 
The <a href="http://www.cgmopen.org">CGM Open Consortium</a> has more
information on WebCGM.

     <li>Fig Plotters.  A Fig Plotter produces a single page of output in Fig
format and directs it to a file or other specified output stream.  The
output may be edited with the free <code>xfig</code> drawing editor.  The
<code>xfig</code> editor can export drawings in various other formats for
inclusion in documents.  See <a href="xfig.html#xfig">xfig</a>.

     <li>PCL Plotters.  A PCL Plotter produces output in PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> format and
directs it to a file or other specified output stream.  PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> is a
powerful version of Hewlett&ndash;Packard's Printer Control Language, which
supports vector graphics.  The output may be sent to a PCL&nbsp;5<!-- /@w --> device
such as a LaserJet printer or high-end inkjet.

     <li>HP-GL Plotters.  An HP-GL Plotter produces output in the
Hewlett&ndash;Packard Graphics Language (by&nbsp;default<!-- /@w -->, in HP-GL/2), and
directs it to a file or other specified output stream.  The output may
be imported into another application, or sent to a plotter.

     <li>ReGIS Plotters.  A ReGIS Plotter produces output in ReGIS (remote
graphics instruction set) format and directs it to a file or other
specified output stream.  The output may be displayed on any terminal or
emulator that understands ReGIS format.  This includes several terminals
from DEC (in particular, the VT340, VT330, VT241, and VT240 terminals),
and <code>dxterm</code>, the DECwindows terminal emulation program.

     <li>Tektronix Plotters.  A Tektronix Plotter produces output in Tektronix
4014 format and directs it to a file or other specified output stream. 
The output may be displayed on any Tektronix 4014 emulator.  Such an
emulator is built into <code>xterm</code>, the X&nbsp;Window<!-- /@w --> System terminal
emulation program.  The MS-DOS version of <code>kermit</code> also includes
such an emulator.

     <li>Metafile Plotters.  A Metafile Plotter produces output in GNU graphics
metafile format and directs it to a file or other specified output
stream.  This format is an extended version of the `plot(5)' format
found on some other operating systems.  (See <a href="Metafiles.html#Metafiles">Metafiles</a>.)  It&nbsp;may<!-- /@w -->
be translated to other formats by an invocation of GNU <code>plot</code>. 
(See <a href="plot.html#plot">plot</a>.) 
</ul>

   <p>A distinction among these types of Plotter is that all except X and X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotters write graphics to a file or other output stream.  An
X&nbsp;Plotter<!-- /@w --> pops&nbsp;up<!-- /@w --> its own windows, and an X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w --> Plotter
draws graphics in one or two X&nbsp;drawables<!-- /@w -->.

   <p>Another distinction is that the first five types of Plotter (X, X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w -->, PNG, PNM, and GIF) produce bitmap output, while the remaining
types produce output in a vector graphics format.  In bitmap output the
structure of the graphical objects is lost, but in a vector format it is
retained.

   <p>An additional distinction is that X, X Drawable, ReGIS, Tektronix and
Metafile Plotters are real-time.  This means that they draw graphics or
write to an output stream as the drawing operations are invoked on them. 
The remaining types of Plotter are not real-time, since their output
streams can only be emitted after all functions have been called.  For
PNM and GIF Plotters, this is because the bitmap must be constructed
before it is written out.  For Illustrator and Postscript Plotters,
it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> because a `bounding box' line must be placed at the head of
the output file.  For a Fig Plotter, it&nbsp;is<!-- /@w --> because color definitions
must be placed at the head of the output file.

   <p>The most important operations supported by any Plotter are <code>openpl</code>
and <code>closepl</code>, which open and close&nbsp;it<!-- /@w -->.  Graphics may be drawn,
and drawing attributes set, only within an
<code>openpl</code><small class="dots">...</small><code>closepl</code> pair.  The graphics produced within
each <code>openpl</code><small class="dots">...</small><code>closepl</code> pair constitute a `page'.  In
principle, any Plotter may be opened and closed arbitrarily many times. 
An X&nbsp;Plotter<!-- /@w --> displays each page in a separate X&nbsp;window<!-- /@w -->, and
Postscript, PCL, and HP-GL Plotters render each page as a separate
physical page.  X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w -->, ReGIS and Tektronix Plotters manipulate
a single drawable or display, on which pages are displayed in
succession.  Plotters that do not draw in real time (PNG, PNM, GIF,
Illustrator, Postscript, CGM, Fig, PCL, and HP-GL Plotters) may wait
until their existence comes to an end (i.e., until they are deleted)
before outputting their pages of graphics.

   <p>In the current release of <code>libplot</code>, Postscript and CGM Plotters
delay outputting graphics in this way, but PCL and HP-GL Plotters output
each page of graphics individually, i.e., when <code>closepl</code> is
invoked.  PNG, PNM, GIF, SVG, Illustrator and Fig Plotters are similar,
but output only the first page.  That is because PNG, PNM, GIF, SVG,
Illustrator and Fig formats support only a single page of graphics.

   <p>The graphics display, or `viewport', that is drawn&nbsp;in<!-- /@w --> by a Plotter
is normally a square or rectangular region on its output device.  But
when using any Plotter to draw graphics, a&nbsp;user<!-- /@w --> will specify the
coordinates of graphical objects in device-independent `user'
coordinates, not in device coordinates.  A&nbsp;Plotter<!-- /@w --> transforms user
coordinates to device coordinates by performing an affine
transformation.

   <p>After invoking <code>openpl</code> to open a Plotter, an application would
usually invoke <code>space</code>.  <code>space</code> specifies a rectangular
`window' in the user coordinate system that will be mapped affinely to
the viewport on the output device.  (The default window is a square,
with opposite corners (0,0) and&nbsp;(1,1)<!-- /@w -->.)  The transformation from
user coordinates to device coordinates may be updated at any later time
by reinvoking <code>space</code>, or by invoking <code>fconcat</code>.  The
<code>fconcat</code> operation will concatenate (i.e., compose) the current
affine transformation with any specified affine transformation.  This
sort of concatenation is a capability familiar from, e.g., Postscript.

   <p>Each Plotter maintains a Postscript-style stack of graphics contexts. 
This makes possible the rapid, efficient drawing of complicated pages of
graphics.  A&nbsp;graphics<!-- /@w --> context includes the current affine
transformation from user coordinates to device coordinates.  It&nbsp;also<!-- /@w -->
includes such modal drawing attributes as graphics cursor position, pen
color, line type, line thickness, fill color, and the font used for
drawing text.  The state of any uncompleted path (if&nbsp;any)<!-- /@w --> is
included as&nbsp;well<!-- /@w -->, since paths may be drawn incrementally, one
portion (line segment, arc, or Bezier curve) at a time.

   <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Much as in Postscript, the current graphics context
may be pushed onto the stack by calling <code>savestate</code>, and popped&nbsp;off<!-- /@w --> by calling <code>restorestate</code>.  However, <code>libplot</code>'s and
Postscript's drawing models are significantly different.  In
<code>libplot</code>, the new graphics context created by <code>savestate</code>
contains no path.  So a new path may be constructed in&nbsp;it<!-- /@w --> from
scratch, and drawn.  Afterwards, the path in the former graphics context
will be returned&nbsp;to<!-- /@w --> when <code>restorestate</code> is called, at which
time it may be extended further.  Another difference from Postscript is
that in <code>libplot</code>, there is no need to start a new path by calling
a `<code>newpath</code>' function.  Instead, you just start drawing.  At&nbsp;least<!-- /@w --> in theory, you do need to end a path explicitly, by calling
<code>endpath</code> to request that it be drawn on the graphics display.  But
the call to <code>endpath</code> can usually be omitted.  For example, calling
<code>restorestate</code> automatically invokes <code>endpath</code> to end the path
(if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->) contained in the current graphics context.

   <p>To permit vector graphics animation, any page of graphics may be split
into `frames'.  A&nbsp;frame<!-- /@w --> is ended, and a new frame is begun, by
invoking the <code>erase</code> operation.  This first terminates the path
under construction, if&nbsp;any<!-- /@w -->.  What then happens depends on whether
the Plotter does real-time plotting.  If&nbsp;it<!-- /@w --> does (i.e., if the
Plotter is an&nbsp;X<!-- /@w -->, X&nbsp;Drawable<!-- /@w -->, ReGIS, Tektronix, or Metafile
Plotter), <code>erase</code> removes all plotted objects from the graphics
display, allowing a new frame to be drawn.  Displaying a sequence of
frames in succession creates the illusion of smooth animation.

   <p>On&nbsp;most<!-- /@w --> Plotters that do not do real-time plotting (i.e., PNG, PNM,
SVG, Illustrator, Postscript, CGM, Fig, PCL, or HP-GL Plotters),
invoking <code>erase</code> deletes all plotted objects from an internal
buffer.  For this reason, most Plotters that do not do real-time
plotting will display only the final frame of any multiframe page.

   <p>GIF Plotters are in a class by themselves.  Even though they do not do
real time plotting, a&nbsp;GIF<!-- /@w --> Plotter can produce multi-image output,
i.e., an animated pseudo-GIF file, from a multiframe page.  As&nbsp;noted<!-- /@w -->
above, the pseudo-GIF file produced by a GIF Plotter will contain only
the first page of graphics.  But if this page consists of multiple
frames, then each invocation of <code>erase</code> after the first will be
treated, by&nbsp;default<!-- /@w -->, as a separator between successive images.
