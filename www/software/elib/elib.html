<h2>Elib</h2>

<p>Elib has been decommissioned as a separate package since its useful
functions have long since been included in Emacs.  The remainder of this
page is kept just for historical purposes.

</p><p>
Elib is designed to be for Emacs lisp programs what
<a href="/software/binutils/binutils.html">libiberty</a>
is for C programs:
a collection of useful routines which don't have to
be reinvented each time a new program is written.

</p><p>
Elib contains code for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>container data structures (queues, stacks, AVL trees, etc)</li>
<li>string handling functions missing in standard Emacs</li>
<li>minibuffer handling functions missing in standard Emacs</li>
<li>routines for handling lists of so-called cookies in a buffer.</li>
</ul>
