<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC8">How Finger Works</A></H2>

<P>
GNU Finger is the collective name for a set of programs:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`finger'</SAMP>
<DD>
Parses the command line and connects to the finger server,
<SAMP>`in.fingerd'</SAMP>, on the <CODE>finger</CODE> server. Returns the output from
the server. <CODE>finger</CODE> connects to <CODE>in.fingerd</CODE> on the host
specified in the command line. This is the only program you need to know
anything about if you're a regular user. You should refer to this
program as the <EM>finger client</EM> to avoid possible confusion.

<DT><SAMP>`fingerd'</SAMP>
<DD>
Regularly connects to <CODE>in.cfingerd</CODE> on the clients specified in the
<TT>`fingerdir/clients'</TT> file, to obtain finger data. This client data
is saved in the file <TT>`fingerdir/userdata'</TT>. <CODE>fingerd</CODE> should
run on the host specified in the <TT>`fingerdir/serverhost'</TT> file.
<CODE>fingerd</CODE> should be started at boot time.

<DT><SAMP>`in.fingerd'</SAMP>
<DD>
Responds to <CODE>finger</CODE> connections through <CODE>inetd</CODE>. Should be
attached to the <SAMP>`finger'</SAMP> service via <TT>`/etc/inetd.conf'</TT>.
<CODE>in.fingerd</CODE> behaves somewhat differently depending on what host it
runs on: on the server host it reads the <TT>`fingerdir/userdata'</TT>
database, on all other hosts it forwards all requests (unless
<SAMP>`.local'</SAMP> is the target) to <CODE>in.fingerd</CODE> on the host specified
in <TT>`fingerdir/serverhost'</TT>.

<CODE>in.fingerd</CODE> reads the <TT>`fingerdir/userdata'</TT> database, various
system files, and makes SMTP connections to the host specified in the
<TT>`fingerdir/mailhost'</TT> file.

<DT><SAMP>`in.cfingerd'</SAMP>
<DD>
This is the program that responds to call-ins from <CODE>fingerd</CODE> by
sampling the status on the client and forwarding it to <CODE>fingerd</CODE>.
It should be configured to respond to the <SAMP>`cfinger'</SAMP> service
specified in the <TT>`clients'</TT> configuration file, or port 2003 if
nothing else is specified.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC9">The <TT>`~/.fingerrc'</TT> Script</A></H2>

<P>
When the GNU Finger server receives a request for information about a
user it looks to see if the user has a <TT>`.fingerrc'</TT> file in the home
directory. If such a file exists, and is executable, then this file
is executed, and the normal finger output is passed to it as input.
Its output becomes what is returned for the request. Thus, it can be
used to:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Disable fingering a specific user by linking
<TT>`~<VAR>user</VAR>/.fingerrc'</TT> to <TT>`/bin/true'</TT>.

<LI>

Entirely replace the output of <CODE>finger</CODE> by ignoring its input. Below
is a sample script which could be put in <SAMP>`~price-info/.fingerrc'</SAMP>.


<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
# This sample script replaces the output of GNU Finger
#
echo Hack-O-Matic Consulting Services, Inc. "   " `date`

cat &#60;&#60;ETX

Hi, thanks for asking us about prices on our newly introduced support
services for Free Software. Below is a list of new services; for a list
of our previous services, please send mail to this address and someone
will contact you. Please don't forget to tell us how to reach you.

ETX
cat ~/info/new-stuff
</PRE>

<LI>

Filter the output to make changes. If the script below is put in
<SAMP>`~bson/.fingerrc'</SAMP> on the finger server host for the domain
<SAMP>`gnu.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP>:


<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
# This sample filter replaces the "Project:" tag with
# "Working on:"
#
sed -e 's/^Project:$/Working on:/g'
</PRE>

Then when <SAMP>`finger -l bson@gnu.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP> is run, the output could
look something like:

<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC10">User-defined Targets</A></H2>

<P>
Various special targets can be added as executable files in the
directory <TT>`fingerdir/targets'</TT>. Each file name in this directory
starts with a letter describing when to execute it, followed by a hyphen
and the target name. The three letters are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`l'</SAMP>
<DD>
In response to a "long" finger; usually by typing <SAMP>`finger -l'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
<DD>
In response to a "short" finger; usually the default if no options are
given.

<DT><SAMP>`x'</SAMP>
<DD>
In response to either a "long" or "short" request.
</DL>

<P>
For instance, the special-target file <TT>`x-.help'</TT> is run for either
<SAMP>`finger .help'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`finger -l .help'</SAMP>, whereas the special-
target file <TT>`l-prices'</TT> is run only for <SAMP>`finger -l prices'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The special-target file is run as super-user, and is given no input. By
convention, all GNU Finger sites should support at least:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`.help'</SAMP>
<DD>
Display message describing what features and special targets exist
on this site.

<DT><SAMP>`.site'</SAMP>
<DD>
Display message describing the site. This may include such things as the
company name, its address, and how to contact the system manager.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC11">How Finger Picks a Port</A></H2>

<P>
When invoked, the GNU Finger client looks to see if a <SAMP>`--port'</SAMP>
option was specified on the command line. If so, then this becomes the
port number or service used. Otherwise, the client looks to see what
name it was started under, removes any leading directory path, and any
trailing suffixes. A suffix is the part of a filename that follows a
dot, including the dot itself. This is the service name used.  For
instance, if GNU Finger is installed as
<TT>`/usr/local/bin/finger.new'</TT>, then the service <SAMP>`finger'</SAMP> is
used. If it's installed as <TT>`/usr/local/bin/gfinger'</TT>, then the
service <SAMP>`gfinger'</SAMP> is used. This behavior can be changed by the
system administrator during installation.
