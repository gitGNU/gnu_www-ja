<P>
Here are the steps that you will need to take in order to install
GNU Finger. 

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Pick a machine which will be the local finger server for your network.
Create a <TT>`clients'</TT> file, and install it in
<TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir'</TT> (or the EtcDir as specified in
<TT>`config.h'</TT>). Put the names of all hosts that should report to the
finger server in this file. Don't forget to include the finger server
itself.

<LI>

For each client (the designated server is also a client), do the
following,

<LI>

Change your working directory to be the top of the GNU Finger sources.
For instance, if you have placed the source in <TT>`/src/gnu/finger'</TT>
you would type <SAMP>`cd /src/gnu/finger'</SAMP>.

<LI>

In the source directory, type <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`./configure'</SAMP>
if this host is different from the previous one.  If you're using
<CODE>csh</CODE> on an old version of System V, you might need to type
<SAMP>`sh ./configure'</SAMP> instead to prevent <CODE>csh</CODE> from trying to
execute <CODE>configure</CODE> itself.

The <CODE>configure</CODE> shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file <TT>`config.status'</TT>
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.

Running <CODE>configure</CODE> takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
prints some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to
see the messages, run <CODE>configure</CODE> with its standard output redirected
to <TT>`/dev/null'</TT>; for example, <SAMP>`./configure &#62;/dev/null'</SAMP>.

To compile the package in a different directory from the one containing
the source code, you must use a version of make that supports the VPATH
variable, such as GNU make.  <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP> to the directory where you want
the object files and executables to go and run <CODE>configure</CODE>.
<CODE>configure</CODE> automatically checks for the source code in the
directory that <CODE>configure</CODE> is in and in <TT>`..'</TT>.  If for some
reason <CODE>configure</CODE> is not in the source code directory that you are
configuring, then it will report that it can't find the source code.  In
that case, run <CODE>configure</CODE> with the option <SAMP>`--srcdir=DIR'</SAMP>,
where DIR is the directory that contains the source code.

You can tell <SAMP>`configure'</SAMP> to figure out the configuration for your
system, and record it in <TT>`config.status'</TT>, without actually
configuring the package (creating <TT>`Makefile'</TT> and perhaps a
configuration header file).  To do this, give <CODE>configure</CODE> the
<SAMP>`--no-create'</SAMP> option.  Later, you can run <CODE>./config.status</CODE> to
actually configure the package for a particular host.  This option is
useful mainly in <TT>`Makefile'</TT> rules for updating <TT>`config.status'</TT>
and <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.  You can also give <TT>`config.status'</TT> the
<SAMP>`--recheck'</SAMP> option, which makes it re-run <CODE>configure</CODE> with the
same arguments you used before.  This is useful if you change
<CODE>configure</CODE>.

<SAMP>`configure'</SAMP> ignores any other arguments that you give it.

If you want to install the GNU Finger configuration files somewhere
other than <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir'</TT>, then you should edit the
files <TT>`./config.h'</TT> and <TT>`include/fingerpaths.h'</TT> now.  You need
to specify the alternate locations of where the configuration files will
be kept. If you want to include the unsupported code for mugshots, then
you should now also choose one of the face formats, as well as edit
<TT>`lib/Makefile.in'</TT>, <TT>`lib/site/Makefile.in'</TT>, and
<TT>`src/Makefile.in'</TT> to compile and link in the files necessary.

If your system requires unusual options for compilation or linking that
<CODE>configure</CODE> doesn't know about, you can give <CODE>configure</CODE>
initial values for some variables by setting them in the environment.
In Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the command line like
this:


<PRE>
CC='gcc -traditional' DEFS=-D_POSIX_SOURCE ./configure
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> variables that you might want to override with environment
variables when running <CODE>configure</CODE> are:

(For these variables, any value given in the environment overrides the
value that `configure' would choose:)

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CC</CODE>
<DD>
C compiler program. Default is <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> if <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> is
in your search path.
<DT><CODE>INSTALL</CODE>
<DD>
Program to use to install files. Default is <SAMP>`install'</SAMP> if you have
it, <SAMP>`cp'</SAMP> otherwise.
</DL>

(For these variables, any value given in the environment is added to
the value that `configure' chooses:)

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DEFS</CODE>
<DD>
Configuration options, in the form <SAMP>`-Dfoo -Dbar ...'</SAMP>
<DT><CODE>LIBS</CODE>
<DD>
Libraries to link with, in the form <SAMP>`-lfoo -lbar ...'</SAMP>
</DL>

<LI>

To build and/or install the GNU Finger executables and standard targets,
issue one of the following commands:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`make server'</SAMP>
<DD>
To build and install all executables, plus install the finger-specific
server configuration files. Use this if the host is the designated
finger server.

<DT><SAMP>`make client'</SAMP>
<DD>
To build all executables, but install only those used by the non-server
clients. Use this unless the host is the designated finger server.

<DT><SAMP>`make all'</SAMP>
<DD>
To build all executables, but perform no installation.
</DL>

The above commands build <TT>`lib/libfinger.a'</TT> and the main programs in
<TT>`src'</TT>: <CODE>finger</CODE>, <CODE>in.fingerd</CODE>, and <CODE>in.cfingerd</CODE>, as
well as <CODE>fingerd</CODE> on the server.  If you want to, you can override
the <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> variables <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> like this:


<PRE>
make CFLAGS=-O2 LDFLAGS=-s
</PRE>

<LI>

Modify the system configuration so that the client has (refer to the
system documentation for details on how to do this on a particular
system):


<UL>
<LI>

Entries in the system <TT>`services'</TT> file, or equivalent, which
mentions the correct TCP port for <CODE>in.cfingerd</CODE> (port 2003) and
<CODE>in.fingerd</CODE> (port 79). If port 2003 is already used by something
else, then read the section on Configuration Files for details on how to
specify a port other than 2003 in the
<TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/clients'</TT> file. A good name for the
service is <SAMP>`cfinger'</SAMP>.
<LI>

Entries in the system <TT>`inetd.conf'</TT> file, or equivalent, which
contains references to <CODE>in.cfingerd</CODE> and <CODE>in.fingerd</CODE>.
<CODE>in.fingerd</CODE> needs to be run with UID <CODE>root</CODE>.  Consult your
system documentation for details on how to do this. <CODE>in.cfingerd</CODE>
should be run with UID <CODE>root</CODE> on System V derivatives.
<LI>

a <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/serverhost'</TT> file which contains the
name of the GNU Finger server host,
<LI>

a <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/mailhost'</TT> file which contains the name
of the mail server to ask for user mail forwarding information and
mailing list expansion, and
<LI>

the inetd daemon restarted, so that server and user requests can be
answered.
</UL>

<LI>

When you have performed the above steps for each client, log onto the
designated GNU Finger server.

<LI>

Start the server daemon, <CODE>fingerd</CODE>. You should arrange to have
<CODE>fingerd</CODE> started every time the server host is rebooted. For exact
details on how to do this, please refer to the server host's system
documentation.

<LI>

If you chose to include the mugshots option, now might be a good time to
install the mugshots.  But first, try getting a face from another site
running GNU Finger!  For example, you might try

<PRE>
<CODE>finger --face bfox@aurel.cns.caltech.edu</CODE>
</PRE>

<LI>

Modify the files <TT>`x-.help'</TT> and <TT>`x-.site'</TT> in
<TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/targets'</TT> for your site.

</OL>

<P>
Now you're all set! You might like to read through the section on
Configuration Files.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC16">Configuration Files</A></H2>

<P>
This section describes the format of the GNU Finger configuration files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC17">The <TT>`clients'</TT> file</A></H3>

<P>
The <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/clients'</TT> file contains a list of
clients that the GNU Finger server <CODE>fingerd</CODE> is supposed to poll.
You can edit this file and then send the finger server a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
to tell it that the configuration has changed. Each line in the file
should be either the name of a host or a comment. The name can be
preceded by <CODE>@<VAR>port</VAR></CODE>, to tell the finger server to poll the
particular host by using a port other than 2003. A comment is any line
that starts with a hash sign (#). Below is a sample <TT>`clients'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
# This file contains all GNU Finger clients on the gnu.ai.mit.edu
# network. Apple-gunkies is the GNU Finger server (see ``serverhost'').
apple-gunkies.gnu.ai.mit.edu

# Albert is the mail exchanger (see ``mailhost'').
albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu

# Spiff is a Sony, so port 2003 is already used for `mbanks'.
# Use port 2010 instead.
@2010 spiff.gnu.ai.mit.edu

churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu
mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu
geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu
wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu
nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu
kropotkin.gnu.ai.mit.edu
goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu
hal.gnu.ai.mit.edu
wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu
</PRE>

<P>
Although this sample <TT>`clients'</TT> file contains the fully qualified
domain names of the hosts, it's usually enough to specify only the host
name portion. Explicit IP addresses can be used too, but this is a
practise strongly discouraged. Notice that the server is also in the
clients file and has a <CODE>in.cfingerd</CODE>; this is necessary in order
for the server to correctly poll itself.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC18">The <TT>`serverhost'</TT> file</A></H3>

<P>
The <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/serverhost'</TT> file holds the name of
the GNU Finger server host; this is as the name implies, the host that
the GNU Finger server <CODE>fingerd</CODE> runs on. Lines starting with a hash
sign (#) are treated as comments. Below is a sample <TT>`serverhost'</TT>
file:

</P>

<PRE>
# A-g does all the finger stuff
apple-gunkies.gnu.ai.mit.edu
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC19">The <TT>`mailhost'</TT> file</A></H3>

<P>
The <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/mailhost'</TT> file holds the name of the
mail exchanger host for the network. This host should know how to talk
SMTP; this file should never hold the name of a host that can't. It's
contacted to obtain mail forwarding information and to expand mailing
lists if a <TT>`.forward'</TT> file can't be found in the user's home
directory. GNU Finger always looks and reports on user <TT>`.forward'</TT>
files regardless of whether <TT>`mailhost'</TT> exists or not. Any lines in
this file that start with a hash sign (#) are treated as comments.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC20">The <TT>`forwardhost'</TT> file</A></H3>

<P>
The <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/forwardhost'</TT> file holds the name of
the host to forward finger requests to when the current finger server
can't find a matching user name or mail alias. No forwarding takes place
if this file doesn't exist. Any lines that start with a hash sign (#)
are treated as comments. This is a sample output of what it can look
like when a request is forwarded:

</P>

<PRE>
% finger -l nosuchuser@gnu.ai.mit.edu
[No user nosuchuser@apple-gunkies.gnu.ai.mit.edu, forwarding
 request to life.ai.mit.edu]
Login name: nosuchuser			In real life: ???
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC21">The <TT>`ttylocs'</TT> file</A></H3>

<P>
The <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/ttylocs'</TT> file holds explanations for
the hosts or terminal lines that users have logged in from or through.
Each client host has its own copy of this file. Each line consists of a
host name followed by a description. The name and description are
separated by one or more blanks or TABs.

<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC22">Site Specific Functions</A></H2>

<P>
If you are interested in customizing GNU Finger's output, then the
<TT>`lib/site'</TT> directory is the right place to start.  If you would
like to add new code for displaying faces, or have a particularly
interesting "long" information output format, I would be glad to
include it as unsupported code in the next release of GNU Finger.  (I
will direct correspondence regarding your code to you.) You can find
other contributed code in <TT>`lib/site'</TT>, most notably different user
info formats and code to handle different bit map file formats. The only
file supported in <TT>`lib/site'</TT> is <TT>`userinfo.c'</TT>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC23">Configuration Options</A></H2>

<P>
The following definitions in <TT>`config.h'</TT> control the behavior
of GNU Finger:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SUPPORT_FINGERRC</CODE>
<DD>
Undefine to prevent users from writing <TT>`.fingerrc'</TT> scripts. Defined
by default.

<DT><CODE>CHECK_OWNER_FINGERRC</CODE>
<DD>
Define to make sure <TT>`.fingerrc'</TT> is owned by the user in whose
directory it's found.

<DT><CODE>CHECK_RDONLY_FINGERRC</CODE>
<DD>
Define to make sure <TT>`.fingerrc'</TT> isn't writable by anyone other than
its owner.

<DT><CODE>FINGERRC_SHELL</CODE>
<DD>
The shell to use to execute <TT>`.fingerrc'</TT>. Undefine to use user's
login shell.

<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL</CODE>
<DD>
Define to be the delay between polls, in seconds, unless an interval is
explicitly given to <CODE>fingerd</CODE> with the <SAMP>`--interval'</SAMP> option.

<DT><CODE>BASENAME_IS_SERVICE</CODE>
<DD>
Undefine if you always want the finger client to use the <SAMP>`finger'</SAMP>
service. Otherwise the service is deduced from the basename of the
client. Defined by default.

<DT><CODE>INFO_IS_DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Define if you prefer <SAMP>`finger --info'</SAMP> to be the default, undefine if
you prefer <SAMP>`finger --brief'</SAMP> to be the default.
