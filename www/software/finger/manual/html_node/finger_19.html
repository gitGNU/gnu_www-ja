<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC19">The <TT>`mailhost'</TT> file</A></H3>

<P>
The <TT>`/usr/local/etc/fingerdir/mailhost'</TT> file holds the name of the
mail exchanger host for the network. This host should know how to talk
SMTP; this file should never hold the name of a host that can't. It's
contacted to obtain mail forwarding information and to expand mailing
lists if a <TT>`.forward'</TT> file can't be found in the user's home
directory. GNU Finger always looks and reports on user <TT>`.forward'</TT>
files regardless of whether <TT>`mailhost'</TT> exists or not. Any lines in
this file that start with a hash sign (#) are treated as comments.
