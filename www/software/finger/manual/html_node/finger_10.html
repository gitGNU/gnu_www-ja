<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC10">User-defined Targets</A></H2>

<P>
Various special targets can be added as executable files in the
directory <TT>`fingerdir/targets'</TT>. Each file name in this directory
starts with a letter describing when to execute it, followed by a hyphen
and the target name. The three letters are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`l'</SAMP>
<DD>
In response to a "long" finger; usually by typing <SAMP>`finger -l'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
<DD>
In response to a "short" finger; usually the default if no options are
given.

<DT><SAMP>`x'</SAMP>
<DD>
In response to either a "long" or "short" request.
</DL>

<P>
For instance, the special-target file <TT>`x-.help'</TT> is run for either
<SAMP>`finger .help'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`finger -l .help'</SAMP>, whereas the special-
target file <TT>`l-prices'</TT> is run only for <SAMP>`finger -l prices'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The special-target file is run as super-user, and is given no input. By
convention, all GNU Finger sites should support at least:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`.help'</SAMP>
<DD>
Display message describing what features and special targets exist
on this site.

<DT><SAMP>`.site'</SAMP>
<DD>
Display message describing the site. This may include such things as the
company name, its address, and how to contact the system manager.
