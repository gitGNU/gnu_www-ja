GNU Finger is a utility program designed to allow users of Unix hosts on
the Internet network to get information about each other.  It is a
direct replacement for the Berkeley 4.3 finger code, although it
produces different looking output and is designed to run on a wide
variety of systems.

<P>
Originally, each host on the Internet network consisted of a single,
reasonably powerful computer, capable of handling many users at the same
time.  Typically, a <EM>site</EM> (physical location of computer users)
would have only one or two computers, even if they had 20 or more people
who used them.  If a user at site A wanted to know about users logged on
at site B, a simple program could be invoked to query the host at site B
about the users which were logged on.

</P>
<P>
With the onset of more-power-per-person computing, the mainframe has
been set aside.  A modern computing facility usually consists of one
user per host, and many hosts per site.  This makes it a trial to find
out about logged on users at another site, since you must query each
host to find out about the single user who is logged on.  If the site
had 20 hosts, you would have to invoke a finger program 20 times just to
find out who was logged on!

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
GNU Finger is a simple and effective way around this problem.  For sites
with many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger <EM>server</EM>
host.  This host collects information about who is logged on to other hosts
at that site.  If a user at site A wants to know about users logged on at
site B, only the server host need be queried, instead of each host at that
site.  This is very convenient.

</P>
<P>
GNU Finger is a direct replacement for existing finger programs.  Since
the finger <EM>protocol</EM> (rules for communication) is very simple, GNU
Finger follows that protocol in responding to simple requests.  But GNU
Finger also implements another protocol which allows two finger programs
to exchange information in a predetermined way, which allows faster and
wider bandwidth communication.

</P>
<P>
Finger delivers information about users in varying formats, depending on
how it is invoked.  <CODE>finger</CODE> invoked without any options performs a
<EM>site wide</EM> finger request, no matter which machine it has been
invoked from.  Switch arguments exist for getting the "long" form of
finger information and for getting information only about the local
machine.

</P>
<P>
If a user on host A wants to know about a user on host B, finger must
make a network <EM>connection</EM> to host B.  If host B is running a
finger program, that program is asked to relay information about the
user in question through the connection back to host A, where finger can
display it.

</P>
<P>
GNU Finger also runs a server <EM>daemon</EM> process on the <EM>server</EM> host,
whose job is to keep track of which users are logged in to local
machines.

</P>
<P>
An optional and currently unsupported feature is passing of graphic
images. This is built on the new protocol.  A user at site A (e.g. MIT)
may see the picture of a user at site B (e.g. UCSB), by typing a finger
request.  The conversion of graphic data from one format to another is
done through GNU Finger; no site need know where or how such images are
stored on any other site to be able to display those images. You should
ask your system administrator to find out whether he has chose to
include this functionality on your network.
