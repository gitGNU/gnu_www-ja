<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC11">How Finger Picks a Port</A></H2>

<P>
When invoked, the GNU Finger client looks to see if a <SAMP>`--port'</SAMP>
option was specified on the command line. If so, then this becomes the
port number or service used. Otherwise, the client looks to see what
name it was started under, removes any leading directory path, and any
trailing suffixes. A suffix is the part of a filename that follows a
dot, including the dot itself. This is the service name used.  For
instance, if GNU Finger is installed as
<TT>`/usr/local/bin/finger.new'</TT>, then the service <SAMP>`finger'</SAMP> is
used. If it's installed as <TT>`/usr/local/bin/gfinger'</TT>, then the
service <SAMP>`gfinger'</SAMP> is used. This behavior can be changed by the
system administrator during installation.
