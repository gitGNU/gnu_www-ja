<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="finger_toc.html#TOC6">Special User Names</A></H2>

<P>
You can give GNU Finger one of several "special" user names.  These
user names all begin with a period (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>) and instruct the receiving
finger daemon to do something that only a GNU Finger daemon can do.
Currently, the "special" names are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`.free'</SAMP>
<DD>
Return a list of free machines.  `Free' machines are those that have no
users logged in, or have been idle for a long time.  The information
returned makes it clear which one is true.

<DT><SAMP>`.all'</SAMP>
<DD>
Return the information about every machine that the Finger server knows
about.  <SAMP>`.all'</SAMP> is equivalent to issuing the <CODE>finger</CODE> command
without specifying the user name.

<DT><SAMP>`.site'</SAMP>
<DD>
Returns information about the site, such as company and location.

<DT><SAMP>`.clients'</SAMP>
<DD>
Returns a list of the clients that the GNU Finger server knows about.
Also lists who is logged onto the console.

<DT><SAMP>`.faces'</SAMP>
<DD>
Return a list of the faces that this server has available.  The last
line output tells you how many lines were listed previously.

<DT><SAMP>`.local'</SAMP>
<DD>
Finger only at the specific machine. This allows finger to continue to
be useful even in the event that the server is down. It also allows you
to examine <EM>all</EM> the login records of a user. Normally, the server
only keeps track of the most recently active login record for each user.

<DT><SAMP>`.help'</SAMP>
<DD>
Describe services provided by the finger server.
