<P>
When the GNU Finger server receives a request for information about a
user it looks to see if the user has a <TT>`.fingerrc'</TT> file in the home
directory. If such a file exists, and is executable, then this file
is executed, and the normal finger output is passed to it as input.
Its output becomes what is returned for the request. Thus, it can be
used to:

Disable fingering a specific user by linking
<TT>`~<VAR>user</VAR>/.fingerrc'</TT> to <TT>`/bin/true'</TT>.

<LI>

Entirely replace the output of <CODE>finger</CODE> by ignoring its input. Below
is a sample script which could be put in <SAMP>`~price-info/.fingerrc'</SAMP>.

#! /bin/sh

# This sample script replaces the output of GNU Finger

echo Hack-O-Matic Consulting Services, Inc. "   " `date`

Filter the output to make changes. If the script below is put in
<SAMP>`~bson/.fingerrc'</SAMP> on the finger server host for the domain
<SAMP>`gnu.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP>:


<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
# This sample filter replaces the "Project:" tag with
# "Working on:"
#
sed -e 's/^Project:$/Working on:/g'

Then when <SAMP>`finger -l bson@gnu.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP> is run, the output could
look something like:
