<h2>Free Software for Windows</h2>

  <p>Here is a list of popular free software applications that run on
  Microsoft Windows &mdash; along with the proprietary applications
  they replace. If you are still a Windows user, you can take a first
  step towards free software by installing these applications.</p>

<blockquote id="windows7sins">

alt="Close Windows, Open Doors" /></a></p>
<p>Upgrade from Windows 8</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>When we say these application programs are <a href=
  "/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, we're talking about
  freedom, not price. It means that you are free to use these programs
  constructively, either alone or in a community, while respecting the
  freedom of others. The source code is available, so that you can
  study the software, adapt it to your needs, fix bugs, and release
  versions with new features. You can also convince or pay others to
  do these things for you. You are also free to give away and free to
  sell copies, under the terms of the applicable free software
  license. These programs are free software because <em>you have
  freedom</em> in using them. Free software develops under the control
  of its users.</p>

  <p>Microsoft Windows is a clear and instructive example of nonfree
  software. Its source code is a secret, so programmers cannot learn
  from it, fix it, adapt it to their clients (your) needs, or even
  verify what it really does. If you share copies with your neighbors,
  you will be called a "pirate", and users have been threatened with
  imprisonment for this. Nonfree software is completely controlled by
  its developer, who also has power over the users. We started the
  free software movement because <a
  href="/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html">this power is
  unjust</a>.</p>

  <p>Using free software on Microsoft Windows (or any nonfree
  operating system) is the first step towards freedom, but it does not
  get you all the way there. You're still under Microsoft's power as
  long as you use Windows.</p>

  <p>So the next step is to replace Windows with
  a <a href="/distros">free operating system such as GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>However, on this page we're concerned with the first step.</strong></p>

  <h3><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/blender.html">Blender 3D</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Maya, 3DSMax</p>

          <p>Blender is the first and only fully integrated 3D
          graphics creation suite allowing modeling, animation,
          rendering, post-production, realtime interactive 3D and
          game creation and playback with cross-platform
          compatibility.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/dia.html">Dia</a></h3>

        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Microsoft Visio</p>

          <p>Dia is designed to be much like the proprietary
          Microsoft program 'Visio'. It can be used to draw many
          different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special
          objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML
          diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple
          circuits. It is also possible to add support for new
          shapes by writing simple XML files, using a subset of SVG
          to draw the shape.</p>

          <p>It can load and save diagrams to a custom XML format
          (gzipped by default, to save space), can export diagrams
          to EPS or SVG formats and can print diagrams (including
          ones that span multiple pages).</p>

	<h3><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/pidgin.html">Pidgin</a></h3>
	  
        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Trillian, AIM, MSN, Yahoo and ICQ chat clients</p>
        
          <p>Pidgin (Gaim) is a multi-protocol instant messaging client,
          with support for:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>AIM (Oscar and TOC protocols),</li>

            <li>ICQ,</li>

            <li>MSN Messenger,</li>

            <li>Yahoo,</li>

            <li>IRC,</li>

            <li>Jabber,</li>

            <li>Novell,</li>

            <li>Gadu-Gadu, and</li>

            <li>Zephyr networks.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Pidgin also supports plugins, for additional
          functionality.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/gimp.html">GIMP</a></h3>
	  
        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro</p>
        
          <p>GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program.
          It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert
          quality photo retouching program, an online batch
          processing system, a mass production image renderer, an
          image format converter, etc.</p>

          <p>GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to
          be augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just
          about anything.</p>

          <p><i>Anyone who is familiar with the GNU/Linux operating
          system has probably seen/used the GIMP at some stage. In
          terms of compatibility, GIMP can open/manipulate the
          PhotoShop <b>PSD</b> format and the Paint Shop Pro
          <b>PSP</b> format.</i></p>

	  <h3><a href="http://gnunet.org">GNUnet</a></h3>
        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Napster, etc.</p>

          <p>GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer
          networking that does not use any centralized or otherwise
          trusted services. A first service implemented on top of
          the networking layer allows anonymous
          censorship-resistant file-sharing. GNUnet uses a simple,
          excess-based economic model to allocate resources. Peers
          in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with respect to
          resource usage; peers that contribute to the network are
          rewarded with better service.</p>

	  <h3><a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></h3>

	  <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Adobe Illustrator,
        Macromedia Freehand, CorelDraw or Xara Xtreme</p>

          <p>Inkscape is an vector graphics editor, with
          capabilities similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw,
          or Xara Xtreme using the W3C standard Scalable Vector
          Graphics (SVG) file format. Supported SVG features
          include shapes, paths, text, markers, clones, alpha
          blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and
          grouping.</p>

          <p>Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data,
          node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap
          tracing, text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing,
          and more. It imports formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and
          others and exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based
          formats.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a></h3>

        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Microsoft Visual C++</p>

<p>MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) provides many of
          the GNU programming utilities on Windows. It includes the
          GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Binutils, GNU Debugger
          (GDB), Make, and more.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.claws-mail.org/">Claws Mail</a></h3>

<p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Outlook, Outlook Express</p>

          <p>Claws Mail is designed to be familiar to new users coming from other popular email clients, as well as experienced users.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a></h3>
        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Microsoft Office</p>

<p>LibreOffice is a multi-platform office productivity
          suite compatible with all major file formats.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a></h3>

<p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> PageMaker, InDesign, QuarkXPress</p>

<p>Scribus is a desktop publishing application, like Adobe PageMaker
          or Adobe InDesign from the proprietary software world. It is
          free software, distributed under the terms of the Gnu
          General Public License.</p>

          <p>Scribus supports many major graphic formats including
          most all of the standard ones used in DTP in addition to
          SVG import and export.</p>

<h3><a href="http://videolan.org/vlc/">VideoLAN Client (VLC)</a></h3>


        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> Windows Media Player, PowerDVD</p>

          <p>VLC (initially VideoLAN Client) is a highly portable
          multimedia player for various audio and video formats
          (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, MP3, OGG, etc.) as well as
          DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. It can also
          be used as a server to stream in unicast or multicast in
          IPv4 or IPv6 on a high-bandwidth network.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tribler.org/">Tribler</a></h3>


        <p><strong>Replacement for:</strong> BitTorrent</p>

          Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer</p>

          <p>QupZilla is a cross-platform web browser with a unified RSS reader, history and bookmarks in a single window.</p>
	<p>Why not recommend Firefox? As explained in our <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition</a>, all 
four freedoms must be available on both a commercial and non-commercial basis. Mozilla's trademark policy serves to limit 
Freedom 2 to gratis distribution only, making the software nonfree.</p>

	<p>This is a selection of the more common free software
  applications available for the Microsoft Windows platform, and is
  nothing like a comprehensive list.</p>
