<p>The ffp package has been decommissioned, since it hasn't been touched
in years.  <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org">audio-video.gnu.org</a>
has some A/V resources.

contacting him.  If you are Jonathan, or know how to reach him, please

What exactly is it that I'm proposing will make up the software
side of this project? Simple. A complete suite of utilities
which, when used together, will act as a complete virtual film
studio. Yes, this is ambitious, but it's almost irrelevant as to
how close to the goal this project ever goes. Every utility that
<u>is</u> written is one more utility people can use and one
fewer that people need to rely on closed, proprietary packages
for. Taking this one step at a time, there is no reason at all
why this should not achieve the same level of success as the FSF
has had in developing a full, free Operating System.
<p>
<h2><center>Design Notes</center></h2>
This is a list of design notes so far written for the project. It
is intended as a guide for programmers wanting to write software
for this project.
<ul>
<li><a href="interop.html">Interoperability Requirements</a>
<li><a href="formats.html">Data and File Formats</a>
<li><a href="graphics.html">Graphics Formats</a>
<li><a href="remote.html">Remote or Distributed Processing</a>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><center>CVS Repository</center></h2>
Programs submitted to the project will be made available to
developers through the Sourceforge CVS repository. The maintainer
may also have a copy available for download. If so, a link will be
added to the location it can be obtained from.
<p>
<h2><center>Mailing Lists</center></h2>
These are mailing lists for the open discussion of issues relating
to the project.
<ul>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=587">FFP Mailing Lists</a>
</ul>
Mailing lists include:
<ul>
<li>freefilm-development - Discussion of development of FFP software
<li>freefilm-writers - Discussion of how to produce GPLed stories
<li>freefilm-project - General discussion list and announcement list
<li>freefilm-current - Discussion of the GPLed movie under production
</ul>
Additional lists may be created, in the future, as the number of
developers for each section increases.
<p>
<h2><center>Software under Development</center></h2>
These are all the programs that have so far been developed for
this project and for which at least some version has been made
available.
<ul>
<li>Graphics Utilities
<ul>
<li>Filters
<ul>
<li><a href="http://willware.net:8080/xyz2rgb.html">xyz2rgb</a>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Lighting Control Software
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=587">OnCue</a>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>
<li>Scriptwriting utilities
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=587">Scriptwriter</a>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><center>Things that need writing</center></h2>
These are the utilities that, so far, have been determined as
being needed for this project. This list is not comprehensive,
nor is it ever likely to be. As packages do get written, by
myself and/or others, a reference will be added under "Software
Under Development". Where "free" programs, from other projects,
fit into this scheme and can be used, they will be added to a
list of "additional packages". This shouldn't deter anyone from
writing exactly the same kind of package, but specifically for
this project. There'll then simply be more than one instance of
that type of program, which is always a Good Thing.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Animators
<li>Audio utilities
<ul>
<li>Editing suites
<li>Manipulation suites
<li>Mixing desks
</ul>
<li>Colour Seperation Overlay software
<li>Graphics utilities
<ul>
<li>Filters
<li>Manipulation toolkits
<li>Rendering packages
<li>Toolkits for manipulating sequences
</ul>
<li>Lighting control software
<li>Modellers
<li>Morphing toolkits
<li>Musical score editors
<li>Project management utilities
<li>Recording utilities (ie: putting output onto film, audiotape
or videotape)
<li>Scriptwriting utilities
<li>Software sound synthesisers
<li>Storyboard utilities
<ul>
<li>Editors
<li>Scripting tools
<li>Viewers
</ul>
<li>Video editing suite
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><center>Additional Packages</center></h2>
These are programs which are either GPLed or otherwise free, which could be
used as substitutes for applications specifically written for this project.

<p>
A number of non-free, zero-cost programs exist, which perform
many of the functions listed. However, the lack of freedom means
that they cannot be adapted to work with any of the packages
above, or any of the other GNU software. I cannot, in good
concience, recommend using them, as a part of this project, for
that reason alone. Unless the programs are freed, there's simply
no way to ensure that they'd work with the other software.

<p>
Even in those cases where there is compatibility, it is very
strongly recommended that people use "free" alternatives, if at
all possible. If no free alternative exists, and you are
interested in writing one, <b>please</b> feel free to do so.
