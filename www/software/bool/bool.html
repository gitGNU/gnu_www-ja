<h2>GNU Bool</h2>

<p>GNU Bool is a utility for finding files that match a
boolean expression.</p>

<p>The boolean operators supported are AND, OR and NOT.
Also supported is the NEAR operator for locating
two expressions within a short distance from each
other.</p>

<p>The text processing algorithm understands that newlines
don't always mean the end of a sentence.  Therefore, the
string "afternoon sun" matches "afternoon\nsun" (notice
the newline) because adjacent lines are assumed to be in
the same context.  On the other hand, two newlines would
not match because they normally indicate a new paragraph
which means a different context.  The dash character is
also supported to separate words before a newline, so
the string "after-\nnoon sun" would match.</p>

<p>The HTML processing algorithm understands many features
of the HTML 4.01 standard.  Entities such as &amp;eacute;
are supported in decimal as &amp;#233; or in hexadecimal as
&amp;#xE9;.  Elements also retain their structural meaning
where the string "daytime" matches "&lt;b&gt;day&lt;/b&gt;time"
because the bold text style does not separate words.
On the other hand, "&lt;p&gt;day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;time&lt;/p&gt;"
does not match because paragraphs separate context.</p>
