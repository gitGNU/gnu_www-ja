<h2>GNU less</h2>

<p>GNU less is a program similar to more,
but which allows backward movement in the file
as well as forward movement.
Also, less does not have to read
the entire input file before starting,
so with large input files it starts up faster
than text editors like vi.
Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems),
so it can run on a variety of terminals.
There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.</p>
