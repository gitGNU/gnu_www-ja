<p>vmslib is looking for a maintainer.  If you have time and inclination
to work on vmslib, please write maintainers@gnu.org.

<p>vmslib helps people port GNU software to VMS.

<p>vmslib is a bunch of files and small routines that can help people to
port GNU programs to VMS.  It consists of a C function library, with
routines that are missing in the current system C libraries that have
been seen so far, maybe with the exception of GNU libc.  In vmslib,
there are also a bunch of scripts (in VMS terminology, they are called
`command procedures') which help a lot in writing makefiles, and other
scripts.  There is more, please read the README file in each directory
for further instruction.</p>

<p>vmslib is different from the package you usually use by not really being a
program that you can use in itself.  Rather, you will tend to copy a few,
or maybe all of the files to whatever other GNU program you wish to port.
There is one program (really a script) that can be used directly, and that
is gen_descrip.com.  It is a command procedure that takes an input file
and generates a makefile, which you can use to automagically copy the right
files to the right other GNU packages.</p>

(circa 1996), as copied from <a

in September 2007.</p>

<p>Thanks to Richard Levitte for creating vmslib, and maintaining it for
many years.  Since Richard no longer uses VMS, it's in need of a new
maintainer.</p>
