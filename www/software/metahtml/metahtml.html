<p>GNU Metahtml is looking for a maintainer.
If you're interested, please take a look at this <a
href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general information about GNU
packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then email
maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and particular
interest in this package.  Thanks.</p>

<p>The sources are currently at <a
href="http://metahtml.sourceforge.net/">, although we would like to move
them to Savannah.
