<h2>Accounts on GNU machines</h2>

<p>The GNU Project has a general login server named
<tt>fencepost.gnu.org</tt> which GNU contributors can have access to.
Some <a href="/prep/maintain/">information for GNU maintainers</a> is
also kept (only) on that host.</p>

<p>The GNU Project also runs a hosting site, <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">savannah.gnu.org</a>.  All GNU packages
are welcome and encouraged to use it, and non-GNU packages are welcome
too.  Creating accounts on savannah is done through its web
interface.  Please note, Savannah and Fencepost accounts are not linked.
You will need to contact accounts@gnu.org if you have lost access
to your account.</p>

<p>(Additional <a href="devel.html">resources for GNU developers</a> are
available, besides these accounts.)</p>

<h3>If you have a Savannah account, with ssh key uploaded</h3>

<p>If you have an account on savannah.gnu.org and <b>have registered an
RSA public key for ssh there</b>, you can request an account on
fencepost by sending email to <a
href="mailto:accounts@gnu.org">&lt;accounts@gnu.org&gt;</a> with the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your full name.</li>
<li>Primary use(s) of your fencepost account (e.g., &ldquo;maintainer of
    GNU Foobar&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Requested username for fencepost account.</li>
<li>An email address that does not deliver via FSF or GNU.</li>
<li>Phone numbers and time of day where we can contact you to
    confirm fingerprints.</li>
<li>Your postal mailing address.</li>
<li>The RSA public key you registered for ssh on savannah.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your ssh public key from Savannah will be used for access to
fencepost.  Your <a href="devel.html">fencepost account can be used</a>
for email, development and testing related to your work on GNU.</p>


<h3>If you have a Savannah account, but no ssh key uploaded</h3>

<p>After logging in to your savannah account, to upload your <a
href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a> public key, do the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>On each machine from which you'll want to connect to savannah,
run <code>ssh-keygen</code> to generate an ssh RSA keypair.  The
resulting public key will be left in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>,
which contains one very long line of ASCII text.  (<a
href="http://meyering.net/nuke-your-DSA-keys/">Do not use DSA
keys</a>.)</li>

<li>Login to <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">savannah</a> in a web
browser.</li>

<li>Click the &ldquo;My Account Conf&rdquo; item in the left-hand
navigation bar.</li>

<li>On the resulting page, click &ldquo;Register an SSH Public
Key&rdquo; (under &ldquo;Authentication Setup&rdquo;).</li>

<li>Paste your ssh RSA public key(s) in the &ldquo;Authorized
keys&rdquo; text field.  Make sure there are no line breaks within a
key.  Then click the &ldquo;Update&rdquo; button.</li>

<li>This will bring you back to the &ldquo;Account Configuration&rdquo;
page.  Verify that the number of &ldquo;SSH Public Keys
registered&rdquo; is the same number that you actually uploaded.  If it
is higher, then some extra line breaks snuck in, so you need to try
again.</li>

<li>Once you've registered on and uploaded your ssh key(s) to savannah,
email <a href="mailto:accounts@gnu.org">&lt;accounts@gnu.org&gt;</a>
with the info listed in the above section and they (the FSF sysadmins)
will give you access.</li>

</ul>

<p>(By the way, you'll also need to have an ssh key uploaded in order to
make commits to repositories.)</p>


<h3>If you don't have a Savannah account</h3>

<p>You need to create a Savannah account and upload your ssh public key
to Savannah.  To create your account, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">http://savannah.gnu.org</a>
(your browser will need to support https).</li>

<li>Follow the &ldquo;New User&rdquo; link, and follow the directions.</li>

<li>Aside: to manage your web pages, source code, and/or ftp area (these
are all independent), you can register a project using the
&ldquo;Register New Project&rdquo; link.</li>

</ul>

<p>Then follow the instructions in the previous two sections.</p>

have an account, additional user support is available on the <a
