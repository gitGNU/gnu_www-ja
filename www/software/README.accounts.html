<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,
     with the SSI statements intact, from
     http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/boilerplate.html?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
-->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain

<h2>Accounts on GNU machines</h2>

<p>The GNU Project has a general login server named
<tt>fencepost.gnu.org</tt> which GNU contributors can have access to.
Some <a href="/prep/maintain/">information for GNU maintainers</a> is
also kept (only) on that host.</p>

<p>The GNU Project also runs a hosting site, <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">savannah.gnu.org</a>.  All GNU packages
are welcome and encouraged to use it, and non-GNU packages are welcome
too.  Creating accounts on savannah is done through its web
interface.</p>

<p>(Additional <a href="devel.html">resources for GNU developers</a> are
available, besides these accounts.)</p>

<h3>If you have a Savannah account, with ssh key uploaded</h3>

<p>If you have an account on savannah.gnu.org and <b>have registered an
RSA public key for ssh there</b>, you can request an account on
fencepost by sending email to <a
href="mailto:accounts@gnu.org">&lt;accounts@gnu.org&gt;</a> with the
following information:
<ul>
<li>Your full name.
<li>Primary use(s) of your fencepost account (e.g., &ldquo;maintainer of
    GNU Foobar&rdquo;).
<li>Requested username for fencepost account.
<li>An email address that does not deliver via FSF or GNU.
<li>Phone numbers and time of day where we can contact you to
    confirm fingerprints.
<li>Your postal mailing address.
<li>The RSA public key you registered for ssh on savannah.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Your ssh public key from Savannah will be used for access to
fencepost.  Your <a href="devel.html">fencepost account can be used</a>
for email, development and testing related to your work on GNU.</p>


<h3>If you have a Savannah account, but no ssh key uploaded</h3>

<p>After logging in to your savannah account, to upload your <a
href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a> public key, do the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>On each machine from which you'll want to connect to savannah,
run <code>ssh-keygen</code> to generate an ssh RSA keypair.  The
resulting public key will be left in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>,
which contains one very long line of ASCII text.  (<a
href="http://meyering.net/nuke-your-DSA-keys/">Do not use DSA
keys</a>.)</li>

<li>Login to <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">savannah</a> in a web
browser.</li>

<li>Click the &ldquo;My Account Conf&rdquo; item in the left-hand
navigation bar.</li>

<li>On the resulting page, click &ldquo;Register an SSH Public
Key&rdquo; (under &ldquo;Authentication Setup&rdquo;).</li>

<li>Paste your ssh RSA public key(s) in the &ldquo;Authorized
keys&rdquo; text field.  Make sure there are no line breaks within a
key.  Then click the &ldquo;Update&rdquo; button.</li>

<li>This will bring you back to the &ldquo;Account Configuration&rdquo;
page.  Verify that the number of &ldquo;SSH Public Keys
registered&rdquo; is the same number that you actually uploaded.  If it
is higher, then some extra line breaks snuck in, so you need to try
again.</li>

<li>Once you've registered on and uploaded your ssh key(s) to savannah,
email <a href="mailto:accounts@gnu.org">&lt;accounts@gnu.org&gt;</a>
with the info listed in the above section and they (the FSF sysadmins)
will give you access.</li>

</ul>

<p>(By the way, you'll also need to have an ssh key uploaded in order to
make commits to repositories.)</p>


<h3>If you don't have a Savannah account</h3>

<p>You need to create a Savannah account and upload your ssh public key
to Savannah.  To create your account, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">http://savannah.gnu.org</a>
(your browser will need to support https).</li>

<li>Follow the &ldquo;New User&rdquo; link, and follow the directions.</li>

<li>Aside: to manage your web pages, source code, and/or ftp area (these
are all independent), you can register a project using the
&ldquo;Register New Project&rdquo; link.</li>

</ul>

<p>Then follow the instructions in the previous two sections.</p>


<h3>Problems?</h3>

<p>If you have questions, problems, or suggestions about this web page,
the account process, or GNU infrastructure, please see the <a
href="/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Getting-Help">Information for GNU
Maintainers</a>.</p>

<p>If you have questions about or problems with using fencepost once you
have an account, additional user support is available on the <a
href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fencepost-users">fencepost-users</a>
mailing list.  Feel free to subscribe.</p>
