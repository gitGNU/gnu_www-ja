<p>pgccfd is the document <a
href="ftp://ftp.axis.se/pub/users/hp/pgccfd/">Porting GCC for
Dunces</a>, written by Hans-Peter Nilsson.  Hans-Peter has had to move
on to other projects, so we are looking for a new maintainer of the
document to bring it up to date with the current gcc, update the license
to the GNU FDL v1.3, move it to savannah, and generally take care of it.

<p>If you're interested, please take a look at this <a
href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general information about GNU
packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then email
maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and interest.  Thanks!
