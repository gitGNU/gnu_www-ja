<p>RX - A fast replacement for the GNU regex library.</p>

<p>RX has been decommissioned, since no one has come forward to revive
it, to improve it over the other free software regex library programs
that are available, which would be quite a big task. (If you are
interested after all, email <a
href="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</a></p>

<p>For a current regex implementation, we recommend using the regex code
from <a href="/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>; see also the <a
href="/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/Regular-expressions.html">Regular
expressions chapter</a> in the Gnulib manual.  (Also, if all you need is
POSIX regexp functionality, any modern C library should provide that.)

<p>The one-time <a href="/software/regex/regex.html">regex</a>
standalone library has likewise been decommissioned in favor of the
above.

     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
