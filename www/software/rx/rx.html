<p>RX A fast replacement for the GNU regex library.</p>

<p>RX has been decommissioned, since no one has come forward to
   revive it, to improve it over the other free software regex library
   programs that are available. (If you are interested after all, email 
    <a href="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</a></p>

     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
