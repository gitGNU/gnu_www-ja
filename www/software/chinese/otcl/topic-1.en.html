Punctuation [The included Chinese characters of this essay are encoded in big5.]
</div>

<p>This column "On Translating Chinese Language", abbreviated as OTCL, is dedicated to provide just enough information to bring GNU project and, mainly, its philosophy into Chinese, both simplified and traditional, since having a standard is crucial to all the translatings as a whole.  I hereby invite you, especially native Chinese speakers, to send your comments and questions to improve this guideline.</p>

<p>If you speak languages other than Chinese, I wish that the information presented is also useful to you, at least you will find some interesting topics that make this eery language so different to others, and survive for more than two thousand years without any significant change in grammar and writings.</p>

<h3>A STORY ON WHY TO USE PUNCTUATION MARKS</h3>

<p>Chinese the language &#8212; at least before Written-in-Vocal-Language Movement <sup><a href="#foot-note-1">1</a></sup> (白話文運動) since early years in twentieth centuary &#8212; did not use punctuation marks.  Together with the basic manner that Chinese words do not have grammatical indicators &#8212; such as prefixes, infixes, or postfixes used to indicate that if a word is plural or adjective &#8212; make this human language some kind of art, but also introduce some problems as we will see below.</p>

<p>Let us first look at the renowed story: A person went visiting hir friend, and stayed for few days because of raining.  The host finally became unwelcoming hir friend but still tried not to talk about this face-to-face, then hse wrote down the words in Chinese, without punctuation marks.</p>

<blockquote>下雨天留客天天留我不留</blockquote>

<p>It's clear that the host had places for hir own punctuation "stops" in mind, and these words would be</p>

<blockquote>下雨天 留客天 天留 我不留.</blockquote>

<p>Then the sentence would be</p>

<blockquote>
下雨天 "rainy day"<br />
留客天 "time to keep guests"<br />
天留 "the weather/god keeps"<br />
我不留 "I do not keep",</blockquote>

<p>which means "Rainy days are time to keep guests at home.  Although the weather/god is willing to keep [you at my place], but I don't."</p>

<p>Of course, the guest knew exactly what hir friend &#8212; maybe not really a friend &#8212; wrote, semantically, but since the host do not put punctuation marks between the words &#8212; Chinese don't have any then, the guest put hir punctuation "stops" and make the words be separated as</p>

<blockquote>
下雨天 "rainy day"<br />
留客天 "time to keep guests"<br />
天留我不 "does weather/god would like to keep me?"<br />
留 "Yes".</blockquote>

<p>These first two are just the same as general Chinese readers would expect, and the last two mean "[Guest asks hirself:] Does weather/god would like to keep me here?  Yes."</p>

<p>There is also another way to separate this sentence, that is</p>

<blockquote>下雨 天留客 天天留我不 留</blockquote>

<p>Then the sentence would be changed semantically as</p>

<blockquote>
下雨 "it rains"<br />
天留客 "the weather/god would like to keep guests"<br />
天天留我不 "keep me everyday or not?"<br />
留 "keep",</blockquote>

<p>which means "It rains, and it looks like the weather/god would like to keep guests.  [Guest asks:] Would you like to keep me everyday?  [Host answers:] Yes, I would."</p>

<p>You will find that just a single sentence would possible be denoted as three or more different ones, <sup><a href="#foot-note-2">2</a></sup> it's surely a kind of art.  This story tells us that if you don't want to keep guests at home, learn to use punctuation marks first ....  Therefore we translators must first learn to use punctuation marks carefully &#8212; especially Chinese translators whose culture did not have them traditionally.</p>

<h3>COMPLEXITY OF A LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>The rules written below are those I will be using if I am going to translate a new essay now.  Although they might change from time to time, but they could already be regarded as stable, since I don't change them for a little while.  These rules are concluded and shaped through my reading experience and I have to say that because of the culture that lacks of using punctuation marks, the rules used by different people, newspapers, periodicals differ in a very dynamic fashion.</p>

<p>English has a similar situation in my observation, but not that dynamic, and the differences are usually minor to each other.  In addition, since English words have grammatical indicators of their own, rules of usage of punctuation marks are simpler than Chinese.  It should be noted that this manner makes English &#8212; and maybe other Indo-European Languages &#8212; to develop a much complex grammar that Chinese traditionally has no way to express, except introducing the use of punctuation marks or breaking an original sentence into several ones.  I should be telling you that Chinese did try to introduce a "structure" to solve some problems for hundreds of years, but it took a print-layout approach, not a development-of-grammatical-indicator one, such as Japanese did.</p>

<p>Concluding the reasons above, I'm starting to believe that the complexity of each language is almost the same.  Either simple words with complex grammars such as English, or simple grammars with complex words such as Chinese, each language takes its very portion in human brains.  No more, no less, just in just.  We shall begin to look at the rules ....</p>

<h3>WHICH PUNCTUATION MARKS TO USE?</h3>

<p>Here are the punctuation marks we should be using, since they are selected such that GNU/Emacs would treat them grammatically while editing Chinese encoded files and they are all available in both big5 and gb2312, major character sets in traditional and simplified Chinese, respectively.  Noted that we have seventy-six marks in traditional Chinese since arranging words vertically is needed in many cases.  This problem can easily be solved by typesetting software these days and no longer required while editing in my point of view.</p>

<p>Fourty Chinese punctuation marks comprise the suggested set, and they could be categoried into two subsets according to my comprehension: the first group includes fourteen marks which are used to structure a sentence;</p>

<blockquote>，、。．•；：？！︰…‥｜╴</blockquote>

<p>and the second group includes twenty-six marks which are used to form advanced textual structures.  It should be noted that Chinese translators may need to use them to "simulate" some English grammar such as "clause."  The use of punctuation marks enables Chinese users would have a chance to take advantage of advanced textual structures, but when it will be too complex to understand, you should tear the original English sentence apart into several Chinese ones, and the line lies in your daily vocal language ....</p>

<blockquote>（）｛｝〔〕【】《》〈〉「」『』﹝﹞‘’“”〝〞‵′</blockquote>

<h3>THE RULES THAT PROPOSED</h3>

<p>General usage of common rules is out of my recording since they should be comprehensive in most cases.  I'm only annoying about those that may not be regarded as "general rules."</p>

<h4>deleting mark "…"</h4>

<p>OK, I know you are taught in school that you should use "six" points to indicate that some part of a sentence or a phrase is deleted to concise the reasoning, but I cannot really tell what is the difference between three points and six points.  And according to my observation, some publications, especially newspapers, use three points as a deleting mark very often.  Since a character of three points is enough to denote its grammatical function, the use of two should better be rejected.  Therefore you should use "…" instead of "……".</p>

<h4>dash "--"</h4>

<p>If you carefully look at the marks above, you will find that there is no dash mark exist.  The first reason is that we are easily to use two hyphens to denote one dash and most typesetting software would do this for you [noted that TeX/LaTeX use three to denote one], since there is no dash-key exist in most keyborads.  The second reason is that we do not have a dash in gb2312 character set of simplified Chinese, although there is one in big5, and this makes iconv(erting) big5 texts into gb2312 not convenient.  Since our works should be prepared for both, additional considerations such as this is nothing but increase our work load, therefore I firmly suggest we use "--" for dash.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in editing htmls, you may use "&#038;&#035;8212;" to indicate a dash, "&#038;&#035;8212;" is recommended in this case since it is suitable for all character sets, and it can be translated into big5 dash correctly if you copy it from htmls to a text file.</p>

<p>You should depress the urge to use dash too often &#8212; well, I am writing down these words to myself, since it cannot be used in very formal writings ....</p>

<h4>parentheses "（" and "）"</h4>

<p>The usage is just the same as English is, but since we are doing translations, they are also used to indicate some translating's original English term.  Such as</p>

<blockquote>因此即使是電腦怪胎（geeks）應該也要….</blockquote>

<h4>brackets "〔" and "〕"</h4>

<p>I propose to use brackets to complement a translated sentence.  For example, while translating this sentence "But only if you're watching" literally you will get</p>

<blockquote>但只有當你在看的時候.</blockquote>

<p>Although Chinese readers would know what you are translating in most cases, they would "feel" that this is not a "sufficient" sentence.  To complement the translating, you will need to add some words on it, and the words should be putted inside brackets such as</p>

<blockquote>但只有當你在〔旁邊〕看的時候〔才成立〕.</blockquote>

<p>I know most translators would just add the words, and without wrapping them inside brackets, but the reason why I suggest to put them inside is that the translaings would be much easier for a possible future software to analyze our works on how to translate English into Chinese, while not sacrificing the criterion that makes them good translations at the same time.</p>

<h4>heavy brackets "【" and "】"</h4>

<p>Heavy brackets are used to insert authors' and/or translators' notes inside, such as</p>

<blockquote>pyDDR 是遊戲 DDR 【跳舞機】的 Python 仿製品.</blockquote>

<p>They can also put footnote numbers inside, such as</p>

<blockquote>改進程式才是對一個駭客技能的真正考驗。【註1】.</blockquote>

<h4>double naming marks "《" and "》"</h4>

<p>Double naming marks are used to indicate a book, an essay or a formal documentation's name, such as</p>

<blockquote>《我的 CJK》第一版熱情上市.</blockquote>

<p>The beginning of the use of double naming marks is just about two decades ago, dating back from now, but it can already be regarded as a punctuating convention.  It's a little strange that I'm not taught about this, we have another "book-name mark" then, and I learned from my reading ....</p>

<h4>single naming marks "〈" and "〉"</h4>

<p>If double naming marks mean to indicate books, then it is easy to parallel that single naming marks are used to denote chapters, or other documentations that can be thought of as subjected portion of one.  For example</p>

<blockquote>《我的 CJK》的〈第九章〉標題為：如何造字？.</blockquote>

<h4>Chinese single quotes "「" and "」"</h4>

<p>If you need to quote Chinese terms or sentences, be using these.  They can also used to indicate some part of a sentence, that is a "unit" such as clause, since sometimes the translated sentences are just too long to be easily understand by Chinese readers.  We therefore use these to guide them with more grammatical structures ....</p>

<h4>Chinese double quotes "『" and "』"</h4>

<p>If you are nested quoting, be using these alternatively with Chinese single quotes.</p>

<h4>English double quotes "“" and "”"</h4>

<p>If you need to quote English or other Indo-European sentences, be using these.</p>

<h4>English single quotes "‘" and "’"</h4>

<p>If you are nested quoting, be using these alternatively with English double quotes.  It should be noted that you should use English double quotes first &#8212; I adopt the American way, British English uses single quotes first, while in Chinese, you should use Chinese single quotes first.</p>

<h3>USAGE OF DASH IN CHINESE</h3>

<p>I separate the usage of dash into two in Chinese, and in these settings, "&#8212;" and single naming marks "〈" and "〉" are used.</p>

<h4>"&#8212;"</h4>

<p>Native dash mark is used to indicate "equality."  For example</p>

<blockquote>在等待的時間中做這 &#8212; 像是等待一段長編譯時 &#8212; 來為身體做點事,</blockquote>

<p>which "等待一段長編譯" is an equality of "等待的時間".</p>

<h4>"〈" and "〉"</h4>

<p>Single naming marks are used to insert another sentence, a clause maybe, into current one.  The inserted sentence functions as a complement/explaination/description in semantics to its host.  For example</p>

<blockquote>謝謝由 Brendan Becker 〈他在一個類似 X11 許可證的許可證下將 pyDDR 實作為自由軟體〉所完成的工作.</blockquote>

<p>I propose to use this setting to translate English "clause."  However, sometimes it would be a little blur to distinguish them from each other.  For example</p>

<blockquote>作者應該 &#8212; 如果他們還沒有這樣做的話 &#8212; 確定他們… and<br />
作者應該〈如果他們還沒有這樣做的話〉確定他們…</blockquote>


<p>are both adequate in some aspects to the above two settings.  I believe that it is not a special case, but don't worry, if we learn more through our translating, we will finally get a better insight on this issue ....</p>

<h3>CLOSING</h3>

<p>Since the rules are not fixed because language lives indeed and  change from time to time, I would like to invite you to suggest more usages of punctuation marks on Chinese and/or other language.  Of course, if you have any question or if you are learning Chinese, I will be very willing to answer your requests.</p>

<p>This is the first topic on translating Chinese language, and I wish if you have any suggestions on this topic, please be informing me.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTE</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<p><a name="foot-note-1">I</a> don't know if there is a formal translating of "白話文運動" &#8212; not a historian I am, and I only translate this movement literally as Written-in-Vocal-Language Movement, WIVLM.  This movement is to have the general public to write as what they speak.  It is not that strange that Chinese people did not write down words as what they speak in the past &#8212; each language has its own literary writings, but Chinese language the case was a kind of radicalism.</p>

<p>Although there is no drastic change in basic grammatical system between modern Chinese and the ancient &#8212; before WIVLMovement &#8212; one, the ancient literary works are generally regarded as being much more concise than modern Chinese, and much more beautiful if you can read them.  The radicalism is that even though that Chinese people of different dialects may pronounce very differently &#8212; for example, I cannot understand what a Hong Konger is speaking, but they write almost the same.  Therefore you may write down and I should be knowing what you mean.  In Indo-European Languages, if you speak different from others, you are possibly speaking a different language, but this is not really true to Chinese.</p>

<p>The most radicalism was made by Korea.  Korean people use Chinese writing system until World War II although they have their own alphabet &#8212; that's right, alphabet, not character.  Korean is thought to resemble Japanese and Finnish but not Chinese &#8212; for hundreds of years.  It's hard to imagine that a whole country would speak Korean while writing Chinese mainly at the same time for such a long period.  It's a little bit like the scenario that England uses Arabic language for her writing system while speaking English until recently.  I don't know how, but Korean did it.  Maybe it's a kind of geographic politics, a means to struggle for life of their own culture ....</p>

<p>However, there is also a notable advantage in a speak different, but write the same language like Chinese, that I &#8212; and maybe most Chinese readers &#8212; am able to read ancient thoughts such as Confucious' directly through original words.  I believe that this is un-thinkable to most other languages' speakers, you don't read Bible written in language that HE speaks after all, but Chinese readers do this in many cases ....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="foot-note-2">Besides</a> the two basic manners that Chinese words have no grammatical indicators and Chinese sentences have no punctuation marks, you may find that it's still not enough to yield the result of three semantics from one sentence if you are a logician or an incorrigible computer scientist, say "hacker."</p>

<p>The missing part you are looking for is that a Chinese sentence can ignore its subject if the "subject" can be known implicitly, and it's a common usage in Chinese language.  The example presented shows pretty well to the phenomenon.  The first interpretation of this sentence "下雨天 留客天 天留 我不留" has a conformable subject, the host;  the last two of the second "天留我不 留" change their subjects to the guest; the third "下雨 天留客 天天留我不 留" even uses two different subjects, that the subject of "天天留我不" is the guest, and the subject of "留" is the host.  How interesting it is!</p>

<p>As a result, a major problem to a native Chinese speaker to learn English is to bear in mind to use a subject even if it's apparently known, and to use a "void" verb, say the "be" group, even if it has no function to complement the semantics.  Further more, the use of "preposition" is also annoying.  Simply a verb with its object is enough, why should we need to consider if it's transitive or not; and if it's intranstive, which preposition should be used.  Every verb in Chinese "can" be transitive, and you do nothing to change the part of speech of a word, just put it on the right place of a sentence, and it's enough.</p>

<p>If you are a computer scientist, it seems that I'm describing a programming language, but not human language Chinese.  Your suspicion is reasonable, and the programming language in mind is Perl.  However, it does not guarantee a Chinese speaker a good Perl programmer, hse has to learn to use English before programming Perl after all.  And if the Chinese has a poor idea about logic, hir Perl code may be only "executable" but not "readable" &#8212; you should know what I'm talking about ....</p>
