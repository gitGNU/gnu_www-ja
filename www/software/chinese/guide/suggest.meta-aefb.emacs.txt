Here is a suggestion on M-a, M-e, M-f, M-b feature in Emacs in editing
Chinese texts.  Please refer to the attachment:

punct.cn.txt (encoded in gb2312, for simplified Chinese)
punct.zh.txt (encoded in big5, for traditional Chinese)

I notice that "the M-f and M-b feature" is applied in editing Japanese
texts, but it would be better if Japanese period could put into M-a
and M-e feature, too.  (Other language like Korean I don't know, but
maybe not much difference.)

After providing this feature in Chinese, Emacs would be even better
(almost ideal) editor in editing Chinese.  Hopefully this will help
more people switch to Free Software.

And please tell me if 40 punctuation marks is still too many to this,
I will further conclude a subset if it's necessary (but I wish they
could all be included.)

Another thing: there is a small bug in <Emacs
Package>/leim/quail/ARRAY30.el, that makes one Chinese character, the
Chinese left brace, could not be input.  Anyway, this is the input
method that I'm using and the attachment is the fixed one.  (I have
checked the xcin counterpart.)
