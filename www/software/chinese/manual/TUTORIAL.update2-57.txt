> * MORE FEATURES
> ---------------
> 
> You can learn more about Emacs by reading its manual, either as a book
> or on-line in Info (use the Help menu or type F10 h r).  Two features
> that you may like especially are completion, which saves typing, and
> dired, which simplifies file handling.
> 
> Completion is a way to avoid unnecessary typing.  For instance, if you
> want to switch to the *Messages* buffer, you can type C-x b *M<Tab>
> and Emacs will fill in the rest of the buffer name as far as it can
> determine from what you have already typed.  Completion is described
> in Info in the Emacs manual in the node called "Completion".
> 
> Dired enables you to list files in a directory (and optionally its
> subdirectories), move around that list, visit, rename, delete and
> otherwise operate on the files.  Dired is described in Info in the
> Emacs manual in the node called "Dired".
> 
> The manual also describes many other Emacs features.
