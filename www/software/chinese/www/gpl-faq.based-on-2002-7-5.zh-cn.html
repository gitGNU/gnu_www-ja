<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhatDoesGPLStandFor" NAME="WhatDoesGPLStandFor">“GPL”代表什么？</A></h4>

<dd>
"GPL" stands for "General Public License".  The most widespread such
license is the GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL for short.  This
can be further shortened to "GPL", when it is understood that the GNU
GPL is the one intended.
<p>

“GPL”代表“General Public License”（通用公共许可证）。这类许可证的一个广泛使用的
范例是GNU通用公共许可证，或者简称为GNU GPL。当有上下文的时候，GNU GPL还可以
进一步简称为“GPL”。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCDoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL" NAME="DoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL">
自由软件一定要使用GPL吗？</A></h4>

<dd>
Not at all--there are many other free software licenses.  We have an
<A HREF="/licenses/license-list.html"> incomplete
list</A>.  Any license that provides the user <A
HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.html">certain specific
freedoms</A> is a free software license.
<p>

并不是那么回事--有许多自由软件许可证。 我们有一个
<A HREF="/licenses/license-list.cn.html"> 不完全的列表
</A>。 任何给用户提供 <A
HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.cn.html">某种程度自由
</A> 的许可证都是一个自由软件许可证。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhyUseGPL" NAME="WhyUseGPL">
为什么要使用GNU GPL，而不是其他的自由软件许可证？</A></h4>

<dd>
Using the GNU GPL will require that all the <A
HREF="/philosophy/pragmatic.html">released improved versions be free
software</A>.  This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete
with a proprietary modified version of your own work.  However, in
some special situations it can be better to use a
<A HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> more permissive license</A>.
<p>

使用GNU GPL要求所有 <A
HREF="/philosophy/pragmatic.cn.html">发布的改善的软件版本都是自由的</A>。  
这意味着不会出现这样的情况：别人修改了你的软件并把它变成私有的，反过来和你竞争。
但是，在一些特殊情况下，使用一个<A HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.cn.html"> 更宽松的许可证</A>会更好些。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCDoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense" NAME="DoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense">
所有的GNU软件都使用GNU GPL吗？</A></h4>

<dd>
Most GNU software packages use the GNU GPL, but there are a few
GNU programs (and parts of programs) that use looser licenses, such as the
Lesser GPL.  When we do this, it is a matter of <A
HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> strategy</A>.
<p>

大多数的自由软件包使用GNU GPL，但是有一些
GNU 程序（和程序的某些部分）使用较宽松的许可证，例如宽通用公共许可证(LGPL)。
我们之所以这么做，是基于 <A
HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> 策略</A>上的考虑。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCDoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware" NAME="DoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware">
使用GPL的程序就是GNU软件吗？</A></h4>

<dd>
Anyone can release a program under the GNU GPL but that does not
make it a GNU package.
<p>

Making the program a GNU software package means explicitly
contributing to the GNU Project.  This happens when the program's
developers and the GNU Project agree to do it.  If you are interested
in contributing a program to the GNU Project, please write to
<A HREF="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
<p>

使用GNU GPL许可证发布一个程序并不会使其成为GNU包。
<p>

要是一个程序成为一个GNU软件包，意味着要明显的把它贡献给GNU工程。
要程序的开发者和GNU工程都同意才行。如果你有兴趣将程序贡献给GNU工程，
请写电子邮件给
<A HREF="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCReportingViolation" NAME="ReportingViolation">
如果发现有违反GPL的情况，我该做些什么？</A></h4>

<dd>
You should <A HREF="/licenses/gpl-violation.html">report it.</a>
First, check the facts as best you can.  Then tell the publisher or
copyright holder of the specific GPL-covered program.  If that is the
Free Software Foundation, write to <A
HREF="mailto:license-violation@gnu.org">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</A>.  
Otherwise, the program's maintainer may be the copyright holder, or
else could tell you how to contact the copyright holder, so report it
to the maintainer.

<p>
你应该 <A HREF="/licenses/gpl-violation.html">报告。</a>
首先，尽可能的核查事实。 然后告诉出版者或者这个基于GPL程序的版权所有者。
如果它属于自由软件基金会，写电子邮件给 <A
HREF="mailto:license-violation@gnu.org">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</A>.  
否则，程序的维护者可能就是版权所有者，或者他能告诉你怎样联系版权所有者，
所以向维护者报告。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions" NAME="WhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions">
为什么GPL允许用户发布经他们修改过的程序版本？</A></h4>

<dd>
A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate.
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other
to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users.
<p>
Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified
versions to go through the original author.  As long as the original
author keeps up with the need for maintenance, this may work well in
practice, but if the author stops (more or less) to do something else
or does not attend to all the users' needs, this scheme falls down.
Aside from the practical problems, this scheme does not allow users to
help each other.
<p>
Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of
preventing confusion between various versions made by users.  In our
experience, this confusion is not a major problem.  Many versions of
Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them
apart.  The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her
name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the
reputations of other maintainers.
<p>

自由软件的一个关键特征就是用户间的自由合作。允许那些想互相帮助的人们
分享他们的程序错误改正和程序改进是绝对重要的。
<p>
有人建议软件的修改版本返回给原作者维护，而不是现在GPL里面规定的那样。
实际上，只要原作者能总是按需维护这个软件，这种方式是不错的，但是如果原作者
去做其他事情或者没有关注所有用户的需求，这种模式就失效了。除了实际问题外，
这种模式不允许用户互相帮助。
<p>
有人建议通过控制修改版本的办法来防止由用户编写的不同版本的软件之间的冲突问题。
依我们的经验，这种冲突不是主要问题。在GNU工程以外有许多Emacs的不同版本，但是用户
能够区分它们。GPL要求一个版本的作者附上他们的名字，就是为了能将这个版本和其他版本

        GPL要求修改过的版本的源代码公开发布吗？</A></h4>

The GPL does not require you to release your modified version.  You are
free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever
releasing them.  This applies to organizations (including companies),
too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally
without ever releasing it outside the organization.
<p>
But <em>if</em> you release the modified version to the public in some
way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available
to the users, under the GPL.
<p>
Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to
release it is up to you.
<p>

GPL并不要求你发布你的修改版本。你可以私下随意的修改和使用，可以不发布。
这也同样适用于组织(包含公司)；组织可以在内部修改和使用，可以不在组织外发布。
<p>
但是 <em>如果</em> 你以某种方式发布了你的修改版本，GPL要求你遵守GPL，将修改后的
源代码也提供给用户。
<p>
即，GPL允许以某种方式，而不是其他方式发布程序的修改版本；但是是否发布完全取决于你。

<dd>
"Valid for any third party" means that anyone who has the offer
is entitled to take you up on it.
<p>
If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source
code, the GPL says you must provide a written offer to distribute the
source code later.  When users non-commercially redistribute the
binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this
written offer.  This means that people who did not get the binaries
directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with
the written offer.
<p>
The reason we require the offer to be valid for any third party
is so that people who receive the binaries indirectly in that way
can order the source code from you.
<p>

“对任何其他团体有效”意味着写任何拥有这个承诺的人都有权从你那里得到它。
<p>
如果你以商业方式发布了软件的二进制二进制码但是没有提供源代码，GPL要求你必须提供
一个书面说明，承诺以后会发布源代码。当用户以非商业方式发布了从你那里得到的
程序的二进制码，他们必须同时提供一份你的这个书面承诺的副本。这就意味着，那些
间接得到你的二进制码的用户仍然可以得到源代码的拷贝。

It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license,

from now, URLs as we know them today may no longer exist.
<p>
The only way to make sure that people who have copies of the program
will continue to be able to see the license, despite all the changes
that will happen in the network, is to include a copy of the license in
the program.

在作品里面包含一份许可证拷贝是至关重要的，这样获得程序拷贝的人就可以知道他

<p>
你也可能想到在作品里面包含一个指向许可证的URL链接，而不是许可证本身。
但是你不能指望这个URL链接在5年或者10年以后仍然有效。20年以后，我们

If the libraries that you link with falls within the following
exception in the GPL:
<p>
<pre>
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
     include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
     binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.
</pre>
<p>
then you don't have to do anything special to use them.  In other
words, if the libraries you need come with major parts of a
proprietary operating system, the GPL says people can link your
program with them.
<p>
If you want your program to link against a library not covered by that
exception, you need to add your own exception, wholly outside of the
GPL.  This copyright notice and license notice give permission to link
with the program FOO:
<p>
<pre>
   Copyright (C) yyyy  &lt;name of copyright holder&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

    In addition, as a special exception, &lt;name of copyright
    holder&gt; gives permission to link the code of this program with
    the FOO library (or with modified versions of FOO that use the
    same license as FOO), and distribute linked combinations including
    the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all
    respects for all of the code used other than FOO.  If you modify
    this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
    do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
</pre>

<p>
Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize this
exception.  If you wrote the whole program yourself, then assuming
your employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are the
copyright holder--so you can authorize the exception.  But if you want
to use parts of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your
code, you cannot authorize the exception for them.  You have to get
the approval of the copyright holders of those programs.
<p>
When other people modify the program, they do not have to make the
same exception for their code--it is their choice whether to do so.
<p>
Adding this exception eliminates the legal issue, but does nothing
about the more serious problem of using a non-free library: your
program won't be fully usable in a free environment.  If your program
depends on a non-free library to do a certain job, it cannot do that
job in the Free World.  If it depends on a non-free library to run at
all, it cannot be part of a free operating system such as GNU; it is
entirely off limits to the Free World.
<p>
So please consider: can you find a way to get the job done without
using this library?  Can you write a free replacement for that
library?
<p>
If the program is already written using the non-free library, perhaps
it is too late to change the decision.  You may as well release the
program as it stands, rather than not release it.  But please mention
in the README that the need for the non-free library is a drawback,
and suggest the task of changing the program so that it does the same
job without the non-free library.
<p>

Also please tell us (<A
HREF="mailto:tasks@gnu.org">&lt;tasks@gnu.org&gt;</A>) about the
non-free library and what job it does.  We could encourage people to
develop a free library to do the same job.

<dd>
Under the Bern Convention, everything written is automatically
copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form.  So you don't have
to do anything to "get" the copyright on what you write--as long as
nobody else can claim to own your work.
<p>
However, registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea.  It
will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US.
<p>
The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if
you are an employee or student; then the employer or the school might
claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them.
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances
such as the laws of the place where you live, and on your employment
contract and what sort of work you do.  It is best to consult a lawyer
if there is any possible doubt.
<p>
If you think that the employer or school might have a claim, you can
resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed
by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school.  (Your
immediate boss or a professor is usually NOT authorized to sign such a
disclaimer.)
<p>

依照伯尔尼公约，任何作品从它以固定的形势发布之时起就自动拥有了版权。
所以你对你的作品不用做任何事情就可以获得版权--只要没有人对你的作品
声明具有所有权。
<p>
但是在美国注册版权是一个好主意。这会使你在美国对付侵权者更有利。
<p>
别人声称对你的作品拥有版权可能你是一名雇员或者学生；此时雇主或者学校可能
声称你是为他们工作，版权应归他们所有。他们的声明是否有效要看具体情况，
例如你生活地区的法律，你的雇佣合同和你做的工作类型。如果有任何的疑虑，
你最好是咨询一下律师。
<p>
如果你认为雇主或者学校拥有版权，你可以让公司或者学校的恰当的授权官员
来签署一个版权弃权声明，清楚地把这个问题解决。 （你的直接领导或者
教授通常没有权利来签署这样一个弃权声明。）

Many universities nowadays try to raise funds by restricting the use
of the knowledge and information they develop, in effect behaving
little different from commercial businesses.  (See "The Kept
University", Atlantic Monthly, March 2000, for a general discussion of
this problem and its effects.)
<p>
If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your
program to be released as free software, it is best to raise the issue
at the earliest possible stage.  The closer the program is to working
usefully, the more temptation the administration might feel to take it
from you and finish it without you.  At an earlier stage, you have
more leverage.
<p>
So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only
half-done, saying, "If you will agree to releasing this as free
software, I will finish it."  Don't think of this as a bluff.  To
prevail, you must have the courage to say, "My program will have
liberty, or never be born."

现今许多大学通过限制它们开发的知识和信息产品来试图积累资金，在效果上其行为
和商业交易没什么区别。（参见“The Kept

<p>
如果你发现你的学校有任何拒绝让你的程序以自由软件发布的可能，你做好尽快把这个问题
提出来。程序开发越接近实用，管理部门就越急着把它从你的手里夺过去，在没有你参与的情况下将其完成。而在早期，你又更多的优势。
<p>
所以我们建议当程序只做到一半儿的时候，你就应该和他们联系，说，“如果你们
同意以自由软件的形式发布，我就完成它。” 不要认为这是威胁别人。为了获胜，
你必须有勇气说，“我的程序要么自由，要么根本不存在”

In general this is legally impossible; copyright law does not give you

your program.  If the user uses your program to enter or convert his

So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if
substantial parts of the output are copied (more or less) from text in
your program.  For instance, part of the output of Bison (see above)
would be covered by the GNU GPL, if we had not made an exception in
this specific case.
<p>
You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its
output even if there is no technical reason to do so.  But if that
copied text serves no practical purpose, the user could simply delete
that text from the output and use only the rest.  Then he would not
have to obey the conditions on redistribution of the copied text.
<p>

一般来说，在法律上是不可能的；版权法没有对程序使用者处理他们自己的数据
而产生的输出做任何说明。如果使用者通过你的程序输入或者转换他自己的数据，
输出的版权属于他，不是你。进而，当程序将输入转换成其他形式，输出的版权
状态继承输入的来源版权状态。
<p>
所以你能对输出声明版权的唯一情况是当输出的主要部分是从你的程序源代码里面
拷贝（或多或少）出来的。例如，如果我们没有特别说明，Bison（见上面）的
输出的一部分将是基于GPL授权的。
<p>
你可以有意将你的程序源代码的一部分复制到输出里面，即使没有什么技术上的原因需要
这么做。但是如果这些复制的代码没有实际用处，用户可以将它们从输出中删去，只使用
剩下的部分。这样，他就不用遵守复制代码的限制条款了。

The GPL says that the whole combined program has to be released under
the GPL.  So your module has to be available for use under the GPL.
<p>
But you can give additional permission for the use of your code.  You
can, if you wish, release your program under a license which is more
lax than the GPL but compatible with the GPL.  The

Yes, because the program as it is actually run includes the library.

<dt><h4><a href="#TOCIfInterpreterIsGPL" name="IfInterpreterIsGPL">If a
  programming language interpreter is released under the GPL, does that
  mean programs written to be interpreted by it must be under
  GPL-compatible licenses?</a></h4>

<dd>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is no.  The
interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software
license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you
use the interpreter on.  You can run it on any data (interpreted program),
any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data
to anyone.
<p>
However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  So if these facilities are released under the
GPL, the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a
GPL-compatible way.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of
such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked
dynamically with the Java programs that call them.
<p>
Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the
interpreter which are themselves interpreted.  For instance, Perl
comes with many Perl modules, and a Java implementation comes with
many Java classes.  These libraries and the programs that call them
are always dynamically linked together.
<p>
A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCGPLAndPlugins" NAME="GPLAndPlugins">If a program

  the licenses of a plug-in.</A></h4>

<dd>
It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins.  If the program
uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate
programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements
for them.
<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, so plug-ins must be treated as extensions to the main
program.  This means they must be released under the GPL or a
GPL-compatible free software license.
<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication
between them is limited to invoking the `main' function of the plug-in
with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline
case.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCGPLPluginsInNF" NAME="GPLPluginsInNF">Can I use the

If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the
plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program

<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, so plug-ins must be treated as extensions to the main

legal problem by adding an exception to your program's license

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCMereAggregation" NAME="MereAggregation">“纯聚合”同“结合两个模块到一个程序里”有什么区别？</A></h4>

<dd>
Mere aggregation of two programs means putting them side by side on
the same CD-ROM or hard disk.  We use this term in the case where they
are separate programs, not parts of a single program.  In this case,
if one of the programs is covered by the GPL, it has no effect on the
other program.
<p>
Combining two modules means connecting them together so that they form
a single larger program.  If either part is covered by the GPL, the
whole combination must also be released under the GPL--if you can't,
or won't, do that, you may not combine them.
<p>
What constitutes combining two parts into one program?  This is a
legal question, which ultimately judges will decide.  We believe that
a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication
(exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.)
and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are
interchanged).
<p>
If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are
definitely combined in one program.  If modules are designed to run
linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means
combining them into one program.
<p>
By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are
communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.
So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are
separate programs.  But if the semantics of the communication are
intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too
could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
program.
<p>


两个程序的纯聚合意味着将他们分立的防在同一个光盘或硬盘上。我们对独立的程序使用这个术语，而不是一个程序的几个部分。在这种情况下，如果一个程序是基于GPL的，它不影响另一个程序的授权方式。
<p>
结合两个模块意味着将他们联接一起来形成一个更大的程序。如果其中任何一部分是基于GPL授权的，那么结合后的整体也必须基于GPL授权来发布--如果你不能或不想这样做，你不能将它们结合。
<p>
怎样才算将两个软件部分结合成一个程序？这是一个法律问题，最终要有法官来裁定。我们认为一个恰当的评判标准既依靠通信机制（exec，管道，远程过程调用，共享地址空间内的函数调用等。）也依靠通信的语法（交换的是什么类型的信息）

<p>
如果这些模块被包含到同一个可执行文件里，那它们就一定是结合为一个程序了。如果这些模块设计成在运行时被连接到同一个共享地址空间里面，那也几乎可以肯定结合成一个程序了。
<p>

而管道，套接字和命令行参数是通常用于独立程序间通信的机制。所以当它们被用于通信时，这些模块是独立的程序。但如果通信的语法过于紧密，交换了复杂的内部数据结构，那也可以考虑认定这两个部分结合成了一个更大的程序。

<dd>
Our lawyers have told us that to be in the <A HREF="/licenses/why-assign.html">best position to enforce

We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from
their employers (if any) so that we can be sure those employers won't

Of course, if all the contributors put their code in the public

  NAME="GPLInProprietarySystem">I'd like to incorporate GPL-covered
  software in my proprietary system.  Can I do this?</A></h4>

<dd>
You cannot incorporate GPL-covered software in a proprietary system.
The goal of the GPL is to grant everyone the freedom to copy,
redistribute, understand, and modify a program.  If you could
incorporate GPL-covered software into a non-free system, it would have
the effect of making the GPL-covered software non-free too.
<p>
A system incorporating a GPL-covered program is an extended version of
that program.  The GPL says that any extended version of the program
must be released under the GPL if it is released at all.  This is for
two reasons: to make sure that users who get the software get the
freedom they should have, and to encourage people to give back
improvements that they make.
<p>
However, in many cases you can distribute the GPL-covered software
alongside your proprietary system.  To do this validly, you must make
sure that the free and non-free programs communicate at arms length,
that they are not combined in a way that would make them
effectively a single program.
<p>
The difference between this and "incorporating" the GPL-covered
software is partly a matter of substance and partly form.  The
substantive part is this: if the two programs are combined so that
they become effectively two parts of one program, then you can't treat
them as two separate programs.  So the GPL has to cover the whole
thing.
<p>
If the two programs remain well separated, like the compiler and the
kernel, or like an editor and a shell, then you can treat them as two
separate programs--but you have to do it properly.  The issue is
simply one of form: how you describe what you are doing.  Why do we
care about this?  Because we want to make sure the users clearly
understand the free status of the GPL-covered software in the
collection.
<p>
If people were to distribute GPL-covered software calling it "part of"
a system that users know is partly proprietary, users might be
uncertain of their rights regarding the GPL-covered software.  But if they
know that what they have received is a free program plus another
program, side by side, their rights will be clear.

There are two reasons for this.
<p>
First, a general one.  If we permitted company A to make a proprietary

that file, the effect would be to make a hole in the GPL big enough to
drive a truck through.  This would be carte blanche for withholding
the source code for all sorts of modifications and extensions to

Giving all users access to the source code is one of our main goals,

You're supposed to provide the source code by mail-order on a physical
medium, if someone orders it.  You are welcome to offer people a way
to copy the corresponding source code by FTP, in addition to the
mail-order option, but FTP access to the source is not sufficient to
satisfy section 3 of the GPL.
<p>
When a user orders the source, you have to make sure to get the source
to that user.  If a particular user can conveniently get the source
from you by anonymous FTP, fine--that does the job.  But not every
user is on a network.  The rest of the users are just as entitled to
get the source code from you, which means you must be prepared to send
it to them by post.
<p>
If the FTP access is convenient enough, perhaps no one will choose to
mail-order a copy.  If so, you will never have to ship one.  But you

arrangements with another site to keep the necessary source code

to the binaries, we think that qualifies as "from the same place".
<p>
Note, however, that it is not enough to find some site that happens to
have the appropriate source code today, and tell people to look there.
Tomorrow that site may have deleted that source code, or simply
replaced it with a newer version of the same program.  Then you would
no longer be complying with the GPL requirements.  To make a
reasonable effort to comply, you need to make a positive arrangement
with the other site, and thus ensure that the source will be available
there for as long as you keep the binaries available.

No, you must supply the source code that corresponds to the binary.
Corresponding source means the source from which users can rebuild the
same binary.
<p>
Part of the idea of free software is that users should have access to
the source code for *the programs they use*.  Those using your version
should have access to the source code for your version.
<p>
A major goal of the GPL is to build up the Free World by making sure

<dd>
This is a well-meaning request, but this method of providing the
source doesn't really do the job.
<p>
A user that wants the source a year from now may be unable to get the
proper version from another site at that time.  The standard
distribution site may have a newer version, but the same diffs

The GPL insists that redistributors of binaries without sources
provide an offer in writing to send the sources, because that's the
only way we can make sure that users can get the sources.
<p>
So if you want to distribute binaries by anonymous FTP, you have to
distribute sources along with them.  This should not be hard.  If you
can find a site to distribute your program, you can surely find one
that has room for the sources.
<p>
The sources you provide must correspond exactly to the binaries.
In particular, you must make sure they are for the same version of
the program--not an older version and not a newer version.

You can make the sources and binaries available on different machines,

Using the Lesser GPL for any particular library constitutes a retreat
for free software.  It means we partially abandon the attempt to

changes for the worse.
<p>
Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy.  Sometimes, using
the LGPL for a library might lead to wider use of that library, and
thus to more improvement for it, wider support for free software, and
so on.  This could be good for free software if it happens to a large
extent.  But how much will this happen?  We can only speculate.
<p>
It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while, see
whether it helps, and change back to the GPL if the LGPL didn't help.
But this is not feasible.  Once we use the LGPL for a particular
library, changing back would be difficult.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWillYouMakeAnException"
  NAME="WillYouMakeAnException">Using a certain GNU program under the
  GPL does not fit our project to make proprietary software.  Will you
  make an exception for us?  It would mean more users of that
  program.</A></h4>

<dd>
Sorry, we don't make such exceptions.  It would not be right.
<p>
Maximizing the number of users is not our aim.  Rather, we are trying
to give the crucial freedoms to as many users as possible.  In
general, proprietary software projects hinder rather than help the
cause of freedom.
<p>
We do occasionally make license exceptions to assist a project which
is producing free software under a license other than the GPL.
However, we have to see a good reason why this will advance the cause
of free software.
<p>
We also do sometimes change the distribution terms of a package, when
that seems clearly the right way to serve the cause of free software,
but we are very cautious about this, and you will have to show us very
convincing reasons.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCVersionTwoOrLater" NAME="VersionTwoOrLater">为什么程序要注明“GPL的第2个及其任何后继版本”？</A></h4>

<dd>
From time to time, at intervals of years, we change the GPL--sometimes
to clarify it, sometimes to permit certain kinds of use not previously
permitted, and sometimes to tighten up a requirement.  (The last
change was in 1991.)  Using this "indirect pointer" in each program
makes it possible for us to change the distribution terms on the
entire collection of GNU software, when we update the GPL.
<p>
If each program lacked the indirect pointer, we would be forced to
discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders, which
would be a virtual impossibility.  In practice, the chance of having
uniform distribution terms for GNU software would be nil.
<p>
Suppose a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version" and
a new version of the GPL is released.  If the new GPL version gives
additional permission, that permission will be available immediately
to all the users of the program.  But if the new GPL version has a
tighter requirement, it will not restrict use of the current version
of the program, because it can still be used under GPL version 2.
When a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version", users
will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to
the terms of GPL version 2--even after later versions of the GPL are
available.
<p>
If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be
obeyed for existing software, how is it useful?  Once GPL version 3 is
available, the developers of most GPL-covered programs will release
subsequent versions of their programs specifying "Version 3 of the GPL
or any later version".  Then users will have to follow the tighter
requirements in GPL version 3, for subsequent versions of the program.
<p>
However, developers are not obligated to do this; developers can
continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL, if that is
their preference.
<p>

有时，隔几年，我们就会更改GPL--有时是为了让条款更清晰，有时是为了取消某种
以前被禁止的使用方式，有时是为了加强某个需求。（最近的更改是在1991年。） 在每个程序里面使用这个“间接指示”是的我们能够在我们更新GPL的时候，能够对整个
GPL软件集进行条款更改。
<p>
如果每个程序里面缺少这个间接指示，我们就不得不和很多版权持有人讨论这个更改，
这几乎是不可能的。实际上，让GNU软件拥有统一的发布条款是不可能的。
<p>
假设一个程序注明了“GPL的第2个及其任何后继版本”，然后一个新版GPL发布了。如果
这个新版GPL增加了额外的许可，这个许可就会立即对所有的这个程序的使用者生效。
但如果这个新版GPL紧缩了要求，这不会限制当前版本程序的使用，因为它仍然可以在
GPL版本2的授权下使用。按照GPL版本2的条款，一个注明“GPL的第2个及其任何后继版本”的程序，用户总是可以使用甚至改变它，即使是后来有新的GPL版本发布。
<p>
如果GPL新版中的紧缩条款不必被现有的软件所遵守，那它有什么用？一旦GPL版本3发布，
大多数GPL程序开发者就会注明“GPL的第3个及其任何后继版本”来发布他们的新版程序。
这样，用户就会遵守GPL版本3里面的紧缩条款来使用新版软件了。
<p>
但是开发者不必非得这么做；如果愿意，开发者可以继续使用以前的GPL版本。
<p>


<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhyNotGPLForManuals" NAME="WhyNotGPLForManuals">为什么手册不使用GPL？</A></h4>

<dd>
It is possible to use the GPL for a manual, but the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL) is much better for manuals.
<p>
The GPL was designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses
that are important for programs, but that are dead weight for a book
or manual.  Conversely, the GFDL has clauses that help publishers
of free manuals make a profit from them.
<p>
We permit changes in the text that covers technical topics, but we do
not permit changes in sections that state our legal or political or
ethical position.  We do this by explicitly listing the sections that
may not be changed.  The GFDL makes provisions for these "invariant
sections"--the GPL would not allow them. 
<p>
It is important to permit changes in technical parts, because people
who change a program ought to change the documentation to correspond.
We can't require them to do this job, but if we hope they will, we 
had better not stand in their way.
<p>

可以将GPL应用于手册，但是GNU自由文档许可证(GFDL)对于手册来说更好。
<p>
GPL是为程序设计的；它包含许多对程序重要的复杂的条款，但它们对于书或者手册
来说是完全没用的累赘。相反，GFDL用一些条款有助于自由文档的出版商从中获利。
<p>
我们允许修改技术主题相关的文字，但是我们不允许修改那些陈述我们法律，政治或者
道德立场的文字。我们明确的列出那些章节不能被修改。GFDL为这些“不变的章节”提供保护
--GPL不允许它们。
<p>
允许技术部分进行修改很重要，因为人们改变了程序，就应该改变相应的文档。
虽然我们不能强求他们做这些工作，但我们希望他们会这么做，我们最好是不要
妨碍他们。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCGPLTranslations" NAME="GPLTranslations">有翻译成其他语言的GPL版本吗？</A></h4>

<dd>
It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages
other than English.  People have even written translations and sent
them to us.  But we have not dared to approve them as officially
valid.  That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it.
<p>
A legal document is in some ways like a program.  Translating it is
like translating a program from one language and operating system to
another.  Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it--and even
then, there is a risk of introducing a bug.
<p>
If we were to approve, officially, a translation of the GPL, we would
be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they
can do.  If it is a completely accurate translation, that is fine.
But if there is an error in the translation, the results could be a
disaster which we could not fix.
<p>
If a program has a bug, we can release a new version, and eventually
the old version will more or less disappear.  But once we have given
everyone permission to act according to a particular translation, we
have no way of taking back that permission if we find, later on, that
it had a bug.
<p>
Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us.
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work, this
would solve it.  But the actual problem is the risk of error, and
offering to do the work does not avoid the risk.  We could not
possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer.
<p>
Therefore, for the time being, we are not approving translations
of the GPL as globally valid and binding.  Instead, we are doing two
things:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Referring people to unofficial translations.
<p>
This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL, but
we don't approve them as legally valid and binding.
<p>
An unapproved translation has no legal force, and it should say so
explicitly.  It should be marked as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    This translation of the GPL is informal, and not officially approved
    by the Free Software Foundation as valid.  To be completely sure of
    what is permitted, refer the original GPL (in English).
</pre>
<p>
But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to
understand the English GPL.  For many users, that is sufficient.
<p>
However, businesses using GNU software in commercial activity, and
people doing public ftp distribution, should need to check the real
English GPL to make sure of what it permits.
<p>
<LI>
Publishing translations valid for a single country only.
<p>
We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are
officially valid only for one country.  This way, if there is a
mistake, it will be limited to that country, and the damage will not
be too great.
<p>
It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic
and capable lawyer to make a translation, so we cannot promise any
such translations soon.
<p>
</UL>

<dd>
将GPL翻译成其他非英语的语言版本是有用的。甚至已经有人做了翻译，并把它们
发送给我们。但是我们还不敢证明他们的官方有效性。那要冒极大的风险，我们
不敢接受。
<p>
一个合法的文档在某种方式上像一个程序。翻译它就像将一个程序从一种语言和操作系统
移植到另一个上面。只有精通这两种语言的律师才能做的来--而且即使这样，
还有引入错误的风险。
<p>
如果我们以官方的方式批准一个GPL译本，我们将允许任何人做译本里面允许的任何
事情。如果它是一个完全的准确的译本，那没问题。
但是如果在译本里面有错误，结果可能是我们无法修正的灾难性的。
<p>
如果一个程序有错误，我们可以发布一个新版本，最终老版本将逐渐消失。但是
一旦我们允许人们按照某个译本里面的规则行事，而后来又发现这个译本有错误，
我们将无法收回许可。
<p>
有时候热心人会主动为我们做翻译工作。如果问题仅仅是找人来做这些事情，
这会有帮助。但实际上是一个错误风险的问题，主动承担工作并不能避免风险。
我们不可能批准一个由非律师翻译的译本。
<p>
因此，从一开始我们不赞成GPL的全球有效性和约束力。
而我们正在做下面的两件事：
<p>
<UL>
<LI> 指引人们做非官方翻译。
<p>
这意味着我们允许人们写GPL的译本，但是我们不会批准它有法律上的有效性和约束力。
<p>
一个未批准的译本没有法律效力，需明确说明。应该如下面的样子标示：
<p>
<pre>
	这个GPL的译本是非正式的，没有经过自由软件基金会的官方批准。要完全确定
	允许的行事准则，请参见原始版本(英文版)。
</pre>
<p>
但是未批准的译本可以用来帮助理解英文版的GPL。对许多用户来说，这已经足够了。
<p>
但是，在商业活动中使用GNU软件的企业和那些从事公共ftp发布的人来说，应该
查看真正的英文版的GPL来确定那些行为是允许的。
<p>
<LI>
发布的译本有效性仅限于一个国家。
<p>
我们正在考虑将发布的官方译本有效性仅限于一个国家。这样，如果有错误，
它也仅限于那个国家，损失也不会太大。
<p>
但这翻译工作仍要求一个理解GPL精神，能力强的律师拥有高超的专业技能和进行大量的工作
所以我们无法承诺近期有任何这样的翻译工作。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCInterpreterIncompat" NAME="InterpreterIncompat">If
a programming language interpreter has a license that is incompatible
with the GPL, can I run GPL-covered programs on it?</A></h4>

<dd>

When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is yes.
The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; the GPL
doesn't restrict what tools you process the program with.

However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an
example of such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way
are linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them.

So if these facilities are released under a GPL-incompatible license,
the situation is like linking in any other way with a GPL-incompatible
library.  Which implies that:

<ol>
  <li>If you are writing code and releasing it under the GPL, you can
  state an explicit exception giving permission to link it with those
  GPL-incompatible facilities.<p>

  <li>If you wrote and released the program under the GPL, and you
  designed it specifically to work with those facilities, people can
  take that as an implicit exception permitting them to link it with
  those facilities.  But if that is what you intend, it is better
  to say so explicitly.<p>

  <li>You can't take someone else's GPL-covered code and use it that
  way, or add such exceptions to it.  Only the copyright holders of that
  code can add the exception.<p>
</ol>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhoHasThePower" NAME="WhoHasThePower">谁有权力强制GPL的执行？</A></h4>

<dd>

Since the GPL is a copyright license, the copyright holders of the
software are the ones who have the power to enforce the GPL.  If you see
a violation of the GPL, you should inform the developers of the
GPL-covered software involved.  They either are the copyright holders,
or are connected with the copyright holders.

因为GPL是一个版权许可证， 软件的版权持有者有权力强制GPL的执行。如果你
发现有违反GPL的行为，你应该通知这个GPL软件的开发者。他们或是版权持有者，
或是和版权持有者有联系。

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCOOPLang" NAME="OOPLang"> In an object-oriented
language such as Java, if I use a class that is GPL'ed without
modifying, and subclass it, in what way does the GPL affect the larger
program?</A></h4>

<dd>
Subclassing is creating a derivative work.  Therefore, the terms of the
GPL affect the whole program where you create a subclass of a GPL'ed
class.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCPortProgramToGL" NAME="PortProgramToGL">If I port
my program to GNU/Linux, does that mean I have to release it as Free
Software under the GPL or some other Free Software license?</A></h4>

<dd>

In general, the answer is no--this is not a legal requirement.  In
specific, the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what
their licenses are.  Most system libraries either use the <A
HREF="/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser GPL</A>, or use the GNU GPL plus an
exception permitting linking the library with anything.  These libraries
can be used in non-free programs; but in the case of the Lesser GPL, it
does have some requirements you must follow.

<p>

Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone; you must use a
GPL-compatible license to use those libraries.  But these are normally
the more specialized libraries, and you would not have had anything much
like them on another platform, so you probably won't find yourself
wanting to use these libraries for simple porting.

<p>

Of course, your software is not a contribution to our community if it is
not free, and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it.
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software,
which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people
to lose their freedom.

<p>

If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that
it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
need to make your software free.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCCompanyGPLCostsMoney" NAME="CompanyGPLCostsMoney">
I just found out that a company has a copy of a GPL'ed program, and it
costs money to get it.  Aren't they violating the GPL by not making it
available on the Internet?</A></h4>

<dd>

No.  The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for
distribution.  It also does not require anyone in particular to
redistribute the program.  And (outside of one special case), even if
someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes, the GPL
doesn't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular, or any
other person in particular.
<p>
What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a
copy to you <em>if he wishes to</em>.  Once the copyright holder does
distribute a copy program to someone, that someone can then redistribute
the program to you, or to anyone else, as he sees fit.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCReleaseNotOriginal" NAME="ReleaseNotOriginal"> Can
I release a program with a license which says that you can distribute
modified versions of it under the GPL but you can't distribute the
original itself under the GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>

Such a license would be self-contradictory.  Let's look at its 
implications for me as a user. 
<p>
Suppose I start with the original version (call it version A), add 
some code (let's imagine it is 1000 lines), and release that modified 
version (call it B) under the GPL.  The GPL says anyone can change 
version B again and release the result under the GPL.  So I (or 
someone else) can delete those 1000 lines, producing version C which 
has the same code as version A but is under the GPL. 
<p>
If you try to block that path, by saying explicitly in the license that 
I'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under 
the GPL by deleting those lines from version B, in effect the license 
now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL 
permits.  In other words, the license does not in fact allow a user to 
release a modified version such as B under the GPL.
