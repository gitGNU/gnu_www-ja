<P>
Can technical writers earn money by writing free documentation for
free software?  We seriously hope so, and that is the reason for
the GNU Free Documentation License.
<P>
The GFDL is meant as a way to enlist commercial publishers in funding
free documentation without surrendering any vital liberty.  The "cover
text" feature, and certain other aspects of the license that deal with
covers, title page, history, and endorsements, are included to make
the license appealing to commercial publishers for books whose authors
are paid.  To improve the appeal, I consulted specifically with staff
of publishing companies, as well as lawyers, free documentation
writers, and the community at large, in writing the GFDL.     
<P>
At least two commercial publishers of software manuals have told me
they are interested in using this license.  The future is never a sure
thing, but the GFDL looks like it has a good chance to succeed in
shaping a social system where commercial publishers pay people to
write commercial free manuals for free software.
