<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhatDoesGPLStandFor" NAME="WhatDoesGPLStandFor">“GPL”代表什么？</A></h4>

<dd>
"GPL" stands for "General Public License".  The most widespread such
license is the GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL for short.  This
can be further shortened to "GPL", when it is understood that the GNU
GPL is the one intended.
<p>

“GPL”代表“General Public License”（通用公共許可証）。這類許可証的一個廣泛使用的
范例是GNU通用公共許可証，或者簡稱為GNU GPL。當有上下文的時候，GNU GPL還可以
進一步簡稱為“GPL”。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCDoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL" NAME="DoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL">
自由軟件一定要使用GPL嗎？</A></h4>

<dd>
Not at all--there are many other free software licenses.  We have an
<A HREF="/licenses/license-list.html"> incomplete
list</A>.  Any license that provides the user <A
HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.html">certain specific
freedoms</A> is a free software license.
<p>

并不是那么回事--有許多自由軟件許可証。 我們有一個
<A HREF="/licenses/license-list.cn.html"> 不完全的列表
</A>。 任何給用戶提供 <A
HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.cn.html">某種程度自由
</A> 的許可証都是一個自由軟件許可証。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhyUseGPL" NAME="WhyUseGPL">
為什么要使用GNU GPL，而不是其他的自由軟件許可証？</A></h4>

<dd>
Using the GNU GPL will require that all the <A
HREF="/philosophy/pragmatic.html">released improved versions be free
software</A>.  This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete
with a proprietary modified version of your own work.  However, in
some special situations it can be better to use a
<A HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> more permissive license</A>.
<p>

使用GNU GPL要求所有 <A
HREF="/philosophy/pragmatic.cn.html">發布的改善的軟件版本都是自由的</A>。
這意味著不會出現這樣的情況：別人修改了你的軟件并把它變成私有的，反過來和你競爭。
但是，在一些特殊情況下，使用一個<A HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.cn.html"> 更寬松的許可証</A>會更好些。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCDoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense" NAME="DoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense">
所有的GNU軟件都使用GNU GPL嗎？</A></h4>

<dd>
Most GNU software packages use the GNU GPL, but there are a few
GNU programs (and parts of programs) that use looser licenses, such as the
Lesser GPL.  When we do this, it is a matter of <A
HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> strategy</A>.
<p>

大多數的自由軟件包使用GNU GPL，但是有一些
GNU 程序（和程序的某些部分）使用較寬松的許可証，例如寬通用公共許可証(LGPL)。
我們之所以這么做，是基于 <A
HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> 策略</A>上的考慮。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCDoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware" NAME="DoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware">
使用GPL的程序就是GNU軟件嗎？</A></h4>

<dd>
Anyone can release a program under the GNU GPL but that does not
make it a GNU package.
<p>

Making the program a GNU software package means explicitly
contributing to the GNU Project.  This happens when the program's
developers and the GNU Project agree to do it.  If you are interested
in contributing a program to the GNU Project, please write to
<A HREF="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
<p>

使用GNU GPL許可証發布一個程序并不會使其成為GNU包。
<p>

要是一個程序成為一個GNU軟件包，意味著要明顯的把它貢獻給GNU工程。
要程序的開發者和GNU工程都同意才行。如果你有興趣將程序貢獻給GNU工程，
請寫電子郵件給
<A HREF="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCReportingViolation" NAME="ReportingViolation">
如果發現有違反GPL的情況，我該做些什么？</A></h4>

<dd>
You should <A HREF="/licenses/gpl-violation.html">report it.</a>
First, check the facts as best you can.  Then tell the publisher or
copyright holder of the specific GPL-covered program.  If that is the
Free Software Foundation, write to <A
HREF="mailto:license-violation@gnu.org">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
Otherwise, the program's maintainer may be the copyright holder, or
else could tell you how to contact the copyright holder, so report it
to the maintainer.

<p>
你應該 <A HREF="/licenses/gpl-violation.html">報告。</a>
首先，盡可能的核查事實。 然后告訴出版者或者這個基于GPL程序的版權所有者。
如果它屬于自由軟件基金會，寫電子郵件給 <A
HREF="mailto:license-violation@gnu.org">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</A>.
否則，程序的維護者可能就是版權所有者，或者他能告訴你怎樣聯系版權所有者，
所以向維護者報告。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions" NAME="WhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions">
為什么GPL允許用戶發布經他們修改過的程序版本？</A></h4>

<dd>
A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate.
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other
to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users.
<p>
Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified
versions to go through the original author.  As long as the original
author keeps up with the need for maintenance, this may work well in
practice, but if the author stops (more or less) to do something else
or does not attend to all the users' needs, this scheme falls down.
Aside from the practical problems, this scheme does not allow users to
help each other.
<p>
Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of
preventing confusion between various versions made by users.  In our
experience, this confusion is not a major problem.  Many versions of
Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them
apart.  The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her
name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the
reputations of other maintainers.
<p>

自由軟件的一個關鍵特征就是用戶間的自由合作。允許那些想互相幫助的人們
分享他們的程序錯誤改正和程序改進是絕對重要的。
<p>
有人建議軟件的修改版本返回給原作者維護，而不是現在GPL里面規定的那樣。
實際上，只要原作者能總是按需維護這個軟件，這種方式是不錯的，但是如果原作者
去做其他事情或者沒有關注所有用戶的需求，這種模式就失效了。除了實際問題外，
這種模式不允許用戶互相幫助。
<p>
有人建議通過控制修改版本的辦法來防止由用戶編寫的不同版本的軟件之間的沖突問題。
依我們的經驗，這種沖突不是主要問題。在GNU工程以外有許多Emacs的不同版本，但是用戶
能夠區分它們。GPL要求一個版本的作者附上他們的名字，就是為了能將這個版本和其他版本
區分開來并保護其他維護者的貢獻。

        GPL要求修改過的版本的源代碼公開發布嗎？</A></h4>

<dd>
The GPL does not require you to release your modified version.  You are
free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever
releasing them.  This applies to organizations (including companies),
too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally
without ever releasing it outside the organization.
<p>
But <em>if</em> you release the modified version to the public in some
way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available
to the users, under the GPL.
<p>
Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to
release it is up to you.
<p>

GPL并不要求你發布你的修改版本。你可以私下隨意的修改和使用，可以不發布。
這也同樣適用于組織(包含公司)﹔組織可以在內部修改和使用，可以不在組織外發布。
<p>
但是 <em>如果</em> 你以某種方式發布了你的修改版本，GPL要求你遵守GPL，將修改后的
源代碼也提供給用戶。
<p>
即，GPL允許以某種方式，而不是其他方式發布程序的修改版本﹔但是是否發布完全取決于你。

<dd>
"Valid for any third party" means that anyone who has the offer
is entitled to take you up on it.
<p>
If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source
code, the GPL says you must provide a written offer to distribute the
source code later.  When users non-commercially redistribute the
binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this
written offer.  This means that people who did not get the binaries
directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with
the written offer.
<p>
The reason we require the offer to be valid for any third party
is so that people who receive the binaries indirectly in that way
can order the source code from you.
<p>

“對任何其他團體有效”意味著寫任何擁有這個承諾的人都有權從你那里得到它。
<p>
如果你以商業方式發布了軟件的二進制二進制碼但是沒有提供源代碼，GPL要求你必須提供
一個書面說明，承諾以后會發布源代碼。當用戶以非商業方式發布了從你那里得到的
程序的二進制碼，他們必須同時提供一份你的這個書面承諾的副本。這就意味著，那些
間接得到你的二進制碼的用戶仍然可以得到源代碼的拷貝。

我們要求這個承諾對任何其他團體有效，這樣間接獲得你的二進制碼的用戶能
從你處獲得源代碼。

absolutely everyone--but this does not require you to *do* anything

under the GPL, for your version.
<p>

第2節聲明你發布的修改版本必須以GPL方式授權給所有第三方團體。“所有第三方團體”

to be copyrighted.
<p>
Whether you claim a copyright on your changes or not, either way
you must release the modified version, as a whole, under the GPL.
<p>

你不需要對你所做的修改做版權聲明。在大多數國家，這是默認的行為，所以如果
你不想你的修改有版權，你需要把你的修改置于顯著的公共位置。

The GPL is a free software license, and therefore it permits people

不。  事實上，象這樣的要求將使程序成為非自由的。如果人們要對他們獲得的
程序拷貝付費，或者如果他們必須特別的通知什么人，則這個程序就不是自由的了。
參見 <A HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.cn.html">

It does not give you permission to distribute the work on any more

Yes.  For instance, you can accept a contract develop changes and

This is permitted because in this case no GPL-covered code is
being distributed under an NDA.
<p>
You can also release your changes to the client under the GPL, but
agree not to release them to anyone else until the client says ok.  In
this case, too, no GPL-covered code is being distributed under an NDA,
or under any additional restrictions.
<p>
The GPL would give the client the right to redistribute your version,
but in this scenario the client will choose not to exercise that right.
<p>

是的。  例如， 你可以接受一個開發合同并
同意不發布 <em>你的更改</em> 直到客戶滿意。
之所以允許這樣是因為沒有基于GPL的代碼以非公開方式發布。
<p>
你也可以在遵守GPL的前提下向客戶發布你的修改版本，但是在你的客戶

You can certainly get credit for the work.  Part of releasing a

Including a copy of the license with the work is vital so that
everyone who gets a copy of the program can know what his rights are.
<p>
It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license,
instead of the license itself.  But you cannot be sure that the URL
will still be valid, five years or ten years from now.  Twenty years
from now, URLs as we know them today may no longer exist.
<p>
The only way to make sure that people who have copies of the program
will continue to be able to see the license, despite all the changes
that will happen in the network, is to include a copy of the license in
the program.
<p>

在作品里面包含一份許可証拷貝是至關重要的，這樣獲得程序拷貝的人就可以知道他
擁有的權利。
<p>
你也可能想到在作品里面包含一個指向許可証的URL鏈接，而不是許可証本身。
但是你不能指望這個URL鏈接在5年或者10年以后仍然有效。20年以后，我們
今天說知道的URL將可能不復存在。
<p>
確保擁有程序拷貝的人們能繼續看到這個許可証的唯一方法就是在程序里面包含一個
許可証的拷貝，不管網絡將發生什么樣的變化。
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhatIfWorkIsShort" NAME="WhatIfWorkIsShort">如果作品比許可証本身長不了多少會怎樣？</A></h4>

The preamble and instructions are integral parts of the GNU GPL and

<p>
The preamble and instructions add up to some 5000 characters, less
than 1/3 of the GPL's total size.  They will not make a substantial
fractional change in the size of a software package unless the package

For some licenses, the way in which the combination is made may affect
whether they are compatible--for instance, they may allow linking two

If the libraries that you link with falls within the following
exception in the GPL:
<p>
<pre>
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
     include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
     binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.
</pre>
<p>
then you don't have to do anything special to use them.  In other
words, if the libraries you need come with major parts of a
proprietary operating system, the GPL says people can link your
program with them.
<p>
If you want your program to link against a library not covered by that
exception, you need to add your own exception, wholly outside of the
GPL.  This copyright notice and license notice give permission to link
with the program FOO:
<p>
<pre>
   Copyright (C) yyyy  &lt;name of copyright holder&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

    In addition, as a special exception, &lt;name of copyright
    holder&gt; gives permission to link the code of this program with
    the FOO library (or with modified versions of FOO that use the
    same license as FOO), and distribute linked combinations including
    the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all
    respects for all of the code used other than FOO.  If you modify
    this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
    do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
</pre>

<p>
Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize this
exception.  If you wrote the whole program yourself, then assuming
your employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are the
copyright holder--so you can authorize the exception.  But if you want
to use parts of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your
code, you cannot authorize the exception for them.  You have to get
the approval of the copyright holders of those programs.
<p>
When other people modify the program, they do not have to make the
same exception for their code--it is their choice whether to do so.
<p>
Adding this exception eliminates the legal issue, but does nothing
about the more serious problem of using a non-free library: your
program won't be fully usable in a free environment.  If your program
depends on a non-free library to do a certain job, it cannot do that
job in the Free World.  If it depends on a non-free library to run at
all, it cannot be part of a free operating system such as GNU; it is
entirely off limits to the Free World.
<p>
So please consider: can you find a way to get the job done without
using this library?  Can you write a free replacement for that
library?
<p>
If the program is already written using the non-free library, perhaps
it is too late to change the decision.  You may as well release the
program as it stands, rather than not release it.  But please mention
in the README that the need for the non-free library is a drawback,
and suggest the task of changing the program so that it does the same
job without the non-free library.
<p>

Also please tell us (<A
HREF="mailto:tasks@gnu.org">&lt;tasks@gnu.org&gt;</A>) about the
non-free library and what job it does.  We could encourage people to
develop a free library to do the same job.

<dd>
Under the Bern Convention, everything written is automatically
copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form.  So you don't have
to do anything to "get" the copyright on what you write--as long as
nobody else can claim to own your work.
<p>
However, registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea.  It
will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US.
<p>
The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if
you are an employee or student; then the employer or the school might
claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them.
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances
such as the laws of the place where you live, and on your employment
contract and what sort of work you do.  It is best to consult a lawyer
if there is any possible doubt.
<p>
If you think that the employer or school might have a claim, you can
resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed
by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school.  (Your
immediate boss or a professor is usually NOT authorized to sign such a
disclaimer.)
<p>

依照伯爾尼公約，任何作品從它以固定的形勢發布之時起就自動擁有了版權。
所以你對你的作品不用做任何事情就可以獲得版權--只要沒有人對你的作品
聲明具有所有權。
<p>
但是在美國注冊版權是一個好主意。這會使你在美國對付侵權者更有利。
<p>
別人聲稱對你的作品擁有版權可能你是一名雇員或者學生﹔此時雇主或者學校可能
聲稱你是為他們工作，版權應歸他們所有。他們的聲明是否有效要看具體情況，
例如你生活地區的法律，你的雇佣合同和你做的工作類型。如果有任何的疑慮，
你最好是咨詢一下律師。
<p>
如果你認為雇主或者學校擁有版權，你可以讓公司或者學校的恰當的授權官員
來簽署一個版權棄權聲明，清楚地把這個問題解決。 （你的直接領導或者
教授通常沒有權利來簽署這樣一個棄權聲明。）

Many universities nowadays try to raise funds by restricting the use
of the knowledge and information they develop, in effect behaving
little different from commercial businesses.  (See "The Kept
University", Atlantic Monthly, March 2000, for a general discussion of
this problem and its effects.)
<p>
If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your
program to be released as free software, it is best to raise the issue
at the earliest possible stage.  The closer the program is to working
usefully, the more temptation the administration might feel to take it
from you and finish it without you.  At an earlier stage, you have
more leverage.
<p>
So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only
half-done, saying, "If you will agree to releasing this as free
software, I will finish it."  Don't think of this as a bluff.  To
prevail, you must have the courage to say, "My program will have
liberty, or never be born."
<p>

現今許多大學通過限制它們開發的知識和信息產品來試圖積累資金，在效果上其行為
和商業交易沒什么區別。（參見“The Kept
University”，大西洋月刊，2000年3月，關于這個問題和其效果
的一般性討論。）
<p>
如果你發現你的學校有任何拒絕讓你的程序以自由軟件發布的可能，你做好盡快把這個問題
提出來。程序開發越接近實用，管理部門就越急著把它從你的手里奪過去，在沒有你參與的情況下將其完成。而在早期，你又更多的優勢。
<p>
所以我們建議當程序只做到一半兒的時候，你就應該和他們聯系，說，“如果你們
同意以自由軟件的形式發布，我就完成它。” 不要認為這是威脅別人。為了獲勝，
你必須有勇氣說，“我的程序要么自由，要么根本不存在”

use, you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it--in
the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any
other free software license.
<p>
Note, however, that there is no world-wide principle of fair use; what
kinds of use are considered "fair" varies from country to country.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCGPLOutput" NAME="GPLOutput">有什么方法能讓使用我軟件的人產生的輸出必須按GPL授權？例如，如果我的程序用來產生硬件設計，我能要求這些設計必須是自由的嗎？</A></h4>

<dd>
In general this is legally impossible; copyright law does not give you
any say in the use of the output people make from their data using
your program.  If the user uses your program to enter or convert his
own data, the copyright on the output belongs to him, not you.  More
generally, when a program translates its input into some other form,
the copyright status of the output inherits that of the input it was
generated from.
<p>
So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if
substantial parts of the output are copied (more or less) from text in
your program.  For instance, part of the output of Bison (see above)
would be covered by the GNU GPL, if we had not made an exception in
this specific case.
<p>
You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its
output even if there is no technical reason to do so.  But if that
copied text serves no practical purpose, the user could simply delete
that text from the output and use only the rest.  Then he would not
have to obey the conditions on redistribution of the copied text.
<p>

一般來說，在法律上是不可能的﹔版權法沒有對程序使用者處理他們自己的數據
而產生的輸出做任何說明。如果使用者通過你的程序輸入或者轉換他自己的數據，
輸出的版權屬于他，不是你。進而，當程序將輸入轉換成其他形式，輸出的版權
狀態繼承輸入的來源版權狀態。
<p>
所以你能對輸出聲明版權的唯一情況是當輸出的主要部分是從你的程序源代碼里面
拷貝（或多或少）出來的。例如，如果我們沒有特別說明，Bison（見上面）的
輸出的一部分將是基于GPL授權的。
<p>
你可以有意將你的程序源代碼的一部分復制到輸出里面，即使沒有什么技朮上的原因需要
這么做。但是如果這些復制的代碼沒有實際用處，用戶可以將它們從輸出中刪去，只使用
剩下的部分。這樣，他就不用遵守復制代碼的限制條款了。

<dt><h4><a href="#TOCIfInterpreterIsGPL" name="IfInterpreterIsGPL">If a
  programming language interpreter is released under the GPL, does that
  mean programs written to be interpreted by it must be under

<dd>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is no.  The
interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software
license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you
use the interpreter on.  You can run it on any data (interpreted program),
any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data
to anyone.
<p>
However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  So if these facilities are released under the
GPL, the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a
GPL-compatible way.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of
such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked
dynamically with the Java programs that call them.
<p>
Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the
interpreter which are themselves interpreted.  For instance, Perl
comes with many Perl modules, and a Java implementation comes with
many Java classes.  These libraries and the programs that call them
are always dynamically linked together.
<p>
A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on.

The advertising clause provides just such a further restriction, and thus is

It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins.  If the program

programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements
for them.
<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, so plug-ins must be treated as extensions to the main
program.  This means they must be released under the GPL or a
GPL-compatible free software license.
<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication

<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCMereAggregation" NAME="MereAggregation">“純聚合”同“結合兩個模塊到一個程序里”有什么區別？</A></h4>

<dd>
Mere aggregation of two programs means putting them side by side on
the same CD-ROM or hard disk.  We use this term in the case where they
are separate programs, not parts of a single program.  In this case,
if one of the programs is covered by the GPL, it has no effect on the
other program.
<p>
Combining two modules means connecting them together so that they form
a single larger program.  If either part is covered by the GPL, the
whole combination must also be released under the GPL--if you can't,
or won't, do that, you may not combine them.
<p>
What constitutes combining two parts into one program?  This is a
legal question, which ultimately judges will decide.  We believe that
a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication
(exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.)
and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are
interchanged).
<p>
If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are
definitely combined in one program.  If modules are designed to run
linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means
combining them into one program.
<p>
By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are
communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.
So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are
separate programs.  But if the semantics of the communication are
intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too
could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
program.
<p>


兩個程序的純聚合意味著將他們分立的防在同一個光盤或硬盤上。我們對獨立的程序使用這個朮語，而不是一個程序的几個部分。在這種情況下，如果一個程序是基于GPL的，它不影響另一個程序的授權方式。
<p>
結合兩個模塊意味著將他們聯接一起來形成一個更大的程序。如果其中任何一部分是基于GPL授權的，那么結合后的整體也必須基于GPL授權來發布--如果你不能或不想這樣做，你不能將它們結合。
<p>
怎樣才算將兩個軟件部分結合成一個程序？這是一個法律問題，最終要有法官來裁定。我們認為一個恰當的評判標准既依靠通信機制（exec，管道，遠程過程調用，共享地址空間內的函數調用等。）也依靠通信的語法（交換的是什么類型的信息）

<p>
如果這些模塊被包含到同一個可執行文件里，那它們就一定是結合為一個程序了。如果這些模塊設計成在運行時被連接到同一個共享地址空間里面，那也几乎可以肯定結合成一個程序了。
<p>

而管道，套接字和命令行參數是通常用于獨立程序間通信的機制。所以當它們被用于通信時，這些模塊是獨立的程序。但如果通信的語法過于緊密，交換了復雜的內部數據結構，那也可以考慮認定這兩個部分結合成了一個更大的程序。

Our lawyers have told us that to be in the <A HREF="/licenses/why-assign.html">best position to enforce

We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from
their employers (if any) so that we can be sure those employers won't

Of course, if all the contributors put their code in the public

encourage people to assign copyright on large code contributions, and
only put small changes in the public domain.

我們也讓獨立貢獻者從他們的雇主那里獲得版權(如果有的話)，這樣我們就能確保那些雇主不會占有成果。

  NAME="GPLInProprietarySystem">I'd like to incorporate GPL-covered
  software in my proprietary system.  Can I do this?</A></h4>

<dd>
You cannot incorporate GPL-covered software in a proprietary system.
The goal of the GPL is to grant everyone the freedom to copy,
redistribute, understand, and modify a program.  If you could
incorporate GPL-covered software into a non-free system, it would have
the effect of making the GPL-covered software non-free too.
<p>
A system incorporating a GPL-covered program is an extended version of
that program.  The GPL says that any extended version of the program
must be released under the GPL if it is released at all.  This is for
two reasons: to make sure that users who get the software get the
freedom they should have, and to encourage people to give back
improvements that they make.
<p>
However, in many cases you can distribute the GPL-covered software
alongside your proprietary system.  To do this validly, you must make
sure that the free and non-free programs communicate at arms length,
that they are not combined in a way that would make them
effectively a single program.
<p>
The difference between this and "incorporating" the GPL-covered
software is partly a matter of substance and partly form.  The
substantive part is this: if the two programs are combined so that
they become effectively two parts of one program, then you can't treat
them as two separate programs.  So the GPL has to cover the whole
thing.
<p>
If the two programs remain well separated, like the compiler and the
kernel, or like an editor and a shell, then you can treat them as two
separate programs--but you have to do it properly.  The issue is
simply one of form: how you describe what you are doing.  Why do we
care about this?  Because we want to make sure the users clearly
understand the free status of the GPL-covered software in the
collection.
<p>
If people were to distribute GPL-covered software calling it "part of"
a system that users know is partly proprietary, users might be
uncertain of their rights regarding the GPL-covered software.  But if they
know that what they have received is a free program plus another
program, side by side, their rights will be clear.

There are two reasons for this.

First, a general one.  If we permitted company A to make a proprietary

the source code for all sorts of modifications and extensions to

You're supposed to provide the source code by mail-order on a physical
medium, if someone orders it.  You are welcome to offer people a way
to copy the corresponding source code by FTP, in addition to the
mail-order option, but FTP access to the source is not sufficient to
satisfy section 3 of the GPL.
<p>
When a user orders the source, you have to make sure to get the source
to that user.  If a particular user can conveniently get the source
from you by anonymous FTP, fine--that does the job.  But not every
user is on a network.  The rest of the users are just as entitled to
get the source code from you, which means you must be prepared to send
it to them by post.
<p>
If the FTP access is convenient enough, perhaps no one will choose to
mail-order a copy.  If so, you will never have to ship one.  But you

to the binaries, we think that qualifies as "from the same place".
<p>
Note, however, that it is not enough to find some site that happens to
have the appropriate source code today, and tell people to look there.
Tomorrow that site may have deleted that source code, or simply
replaced it with a newer version of the same program.  Then you would
no longer be complying with the GPL requirements.  To make a
reasonable effort to comply, you need to make a positive arrangement
with the other site, and thus ensure that the source will be available
there for as long as you keep the binaries available.

<p>
Part of the idea of free software is that users should have access to

This is a well-meaning request, but this method of providing the

A user that wants the source a year from now may be unable to get the
proper version from another site at that time.  The standard

only way we can make sure that users can get the sources.
<p>
So if you want to distribute binaries by anonymous FTP, you have to
distribute sources along with them.  This should not be hard.  If you
can find a site to distribute your program, you can surely find one
that has room for the sources.

The sources you provide must correspond exactly to the binaries.
In particular, you must make sure they are for the same version of
the program--not an older version and not a newer version.

Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy.  Sometimes, using

so on.  This could be good for free software if it happens to a large
extent.  But how much will this happen?  We can only speculate.
<p>
It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while, see
whether it helps, and change back to the GPL if the LGPL didn't help.
But this is not feasible.  Once we use the LGPL for a particular
library, changing back would be difficult.
<p>
So we decide which license to use for each library on a case-by-case
basis.  There is a <A HREF="/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">
long explanation</A> of how we judge the question.
<p>

對特定的程序庫使用LGPL是自由軟件的一種妥協。它意味著我們部分的放棄了我們
保護用戶自由權利的行為，和一些用于建造基于GPL軟件共享所必要的條件。在
它們內部，那些是不利的改變。
<p>
有時候一個局部的妥協是好策略。有時對一個程序庫使用LGPL將能導致這個庫的
更廣泛的應用，進而更好的改進它，對自由軟件的更廣泛的支持，等等。如果這種
情形擴展的更廣，對自由軟件是有好處的。但是范圍有多廣？我們只能估計。
<p>
對每個程序庫應用LGPL一段時間進行考察是個不錯的主意，看它是否有幫助，如果
LGPL沒有幫助那就改回GPL上來。但是這不可行。一旦你對一個程序庫使用LGPL，
再改回來會很困難。
<p>
所以我們基于具體事例來決定對每個程序庫使用哪個許可証。

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWillYouMakeAnException"
  NAME="WillYouMakeAnException">Using a certain GNU program under the
  GPL does not fit our project to make proprietary software.  Will you
  make an exception for us?  It would mean more users of that
  program.</A></h4>

<dd>
Sorry, we don't make such exceptions.  It would not be right.
<p>
Maximizing the number of users is not our aim.  Rather, we are trying
to give the crucial freedoms to as many users as possible.  In
general, proprietary software projects hinder rather than help the
cause of freedom.
<p>
We do occasionally make license exceptions to assist a project which
is producing free software under a license other than the GPL.
However, we have to see a good reason why this will advance the cause
of free software.
<p>
We also do sometimes change the distribution terms of a package, when
that seems clearly the right way to serve the cause of free software,
but we are very cautious about this, and you will have to show us very
convincing reasons.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCVersionTwoOrLater" NAME="VersionTwoOrLater">為什么程序要注明“GPL的第2個及其任何后繼版本”？</A></h4>

<dd>
From time to time, at intervals of years, we change the GPL--sometimes
to clarify it, sometimes to permit certain kinds of use not previously
permitted, and sometimes to tighten up a requirement.  (The last
change was in 1991.)  Using this "indirect pointer" in each program
makes it possible for us to change the distribution terms on the
entire collection of GNU software, when we update the GPL.
<p>
If each program lacked the indirect pointer, we would be forced to
discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders, which
would be a virtual impossibility.  In practice, the chance of having
uniform distribution terms for GNU software would be nil.
<p>
Suppose a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version" and
a new version of the GPL is released.  If the new GPL version gives
additional permission, that permission will be available immediately
to all the users of the program.  But if the new GPL version has a
tighter requirement, it will not restrict use of the current version
of the program, because it can still be used under GPL version 2.
When a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version", users
will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to
the terms of GPL version 2--even after later versions of the GPL are
available.
<p>
If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be
obeyed for existing software, how is it useful?  Once GPL version 3 is
available, the developers of most GPL-covered programs will release
subsequent versions of their programs specifying "Version 3 of the GPL
or any later version".  Then users will have to follow the tighter
requirements in GPL version 3, for subsequent versions of the program.
<p>
However, developers are not obligated to do this; developers can
continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL, if that is
their preference.
<p>

有時，隔几年，我們就會更改GPL--有時是為了讓條款更清晰，有時是為了取消某種
以前被禁止的使用方式，有時是為了加強某個需求。（最近的更改是在1991年。） 在每個程序里面使用這個“間接指示”是的我們能夠在我們更新GPL的時候，能夠對整個
GPL軟件集進行條款更改。
<p>
如果每個程序里面缺少這個間接指示，我們就不得不和很多版權持有人討論這個更改，
這几乎是不可能的。實際上，讓GNU軟件擁有統一的發布條款是不可能的。
<p>
假設一個程序注明了“GPL的第2個及其任何后繼版本”，然后一個新版GPL發布了。如果
這個新版GPL增加了額外的許可，這個許可就會立即對所有的這個程序的使用者生效。
但如果這個新版GPL緊縮了要求，這不會限制當前版本程序的使用，因為它仍然可以在
GPL版本2的授權下使用。按照GPL版本2的條款，一個注明“GPL的第2個及其任何后繼版本”的程序，用戶總是可以使用甚至改變它，即使是后來有新的GPL版本發布。
<p>
如果GPL新版中的緊縮條款不必被現有的軟件所遵守，那它有什么用？一旦GPL版本3發布，
大多數GPL程序開發者就會注明“GPL的第3個及其任何后繼版本”來發布他們的新版程序。
這樣，用戶就會遵守GPL版本3里面的緊縮條款來使用新版軟件了。
<p>
但是開發者不必非得這么做﹔如果愿意，開發者可以繼續使用以前的GPL版本。

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhyNotGPLForManuals" NAME="WhyNotGPLForManuals">為什么手冊不使用GPL？</A></h4>

<dd>
It is possible to use the GPL for a manual, but the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL) is much better for manuals.
<p>
The GPL was designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses
that are important for programs, but that are dead weight for a book
or manual.  Conversely, the GFDL has clauses that help publishers
of free manuals make a profit from them.
<p>
We permit changes in the text that covers technical topics, but we do
not permit changes in sections that state our legal or political or
ethical position.  We do this by explicitly listing the sections that
may not be changed.  The GFDL makes provisions for these "invariant
sections"--the GPL would not allow them.
<p>
It is important to permit changes in technical parts, because people
who change a program ought to change the documentation to correspond.
We can't require them to do this job, but if we hope they will, we
had better not stand in their way.
<p>

可以將GPL應用于手冊，但是GNU自由文檔許可証(GFDL)對于手冊來說更好。
<p>
GPL是為程序設計的﹔它包含許多對程序重要的復雜的條款，但它們對于書或者手冊
來說是完全沒用的累贅。相反，GFDL用一些條款有助于自由文檔的出版商從中獲利。
<p>
我們允許修改技朮主題相關的文字，但是我們不允許修改那些陳述我們法律，政治或者
道德立場的文字。我們明確的列出那些章節不能被修改。GFDL為這些“不變的章節”提供保護
--GPL不允許它們。
<p>
允許技朮部分進行修改很重要，因為人們改變了程序，就應該改變相應的文檔。
雖然我們不能強求他們做這些工作，但我們希望他們會這么做，我們最好是不要
妨礙他們。

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCGPLTranslations" NAME="GPLTranslations">有翻譯成其他語言的GPL版本嗎？</A></h4>

<dd>
It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages
other than English.  People have even written translations and sent
them to us.  But we have not dared to approve them as officially
valid.  That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it.
<p>
A legal document is in some ways like a program.  Translating it is
like translating a program from one language and operating system to
another.  Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it--and even
then, there is a risk of introducing a bug.
<p>
If we were to approve, officially, a translation of the GPL, we would
be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they
can do.  If it is a completely accurate translation, that is fine.
But if there is an error in the translation, the results could be a
disaster which we could not fix.
<p>
If a program has a bug, we can release a new version, and eventually
the old version will more or less disappear.  But once we have given
everyone permission to act according to a particular translation, we
have no way of taking back that permission if we find, later on, that
it had a bug.
<p>
Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us.
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work, this
would solve it.  But the actual problem is the risk of error, and
offering to do the work does not avoid the risk.  We could not
possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer.
<p>
Therefore, for the time being, we are not approving translations
of the GPL as globally valid and binding.  Instead, we are doing two
things:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Referring people to unofficial translations.
<p>
This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL, but
we don't approve them as legally valid and binding.
<p>
An unapproved translation has no legal force, and it should say so
explicitly.  It should be marked as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    This translation of the GPL is informal, and not officially approved
    by the Free Software Foundation as valid.  To be completely sure of
    what is permitted, refer the original GPL (in English).
</pre>
<p>
But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to
understand the English GPL.  For many users, that is sufficient.
<p>
However, businesses using GNU software in commercial activity, and
people doing public ftp distribution, should need to check the real
English GPL to make sure of what it permits.
<p>
<LI>
Publishing translations valid for a single country only.
<p>
We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are
officially valid only for one country.  This way, if there is a
mistake, it will be limited to that country, and the damage will not
be too great.
<p>
It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic
and capable lawyer to make a translation, so we cannot promise any
such translations soon.
<p>
</UL>

<dd>
將GPL翻譯成其他非英語的語言版本是有用的。甚至已經有人做了翻譯，并把它們
發送給我們。但是我們還不敢証明他們的官方有效性。那要冒極大的風險，我們
不敢接受。
<p>
一個合法的文檔在某種方式上像一個程序。翻譯它就像將一個程序從一種語言和操作系統
移植到另一個上面。只有精通這兩種語言的律師才能做的來--而且即使這樣，
還有引入錯誤的風險。
<p>
如果我們以官方的方式批准一個GPL譯本，我們將允許任何人做譯本里面允許的任何
事情。如果它是一個完全的准確的譯本，那沒問題。
但是如果在譯本里面有錯誤，結果可能是我們無法修正的災難性的。
<p>
如果一個程序有錯誤，我們可以發布一個新版本，最終老版本將逐漸消失。但是
一旦我們允許人們按照某個譯本里面的規則行事，而后來又發現這個譯本有錯誤，
我們將無法收回許可。
<p>
有時候熱心人會主動為我們做翻譯工作。如果問題僅僅是找人來做這些事情，
這會有幫助。但實際上是一個錯誤風險的問題，主動承擔工作并不能避免風險。
我們不可能批准一個由非律師翻譯的譯本。
<p>
因此，從一開始我們不贊成GPL的全球有效性和約束力。
而我們正在做下面的兩件事：
<p>
<UL>
<LI> 指引人們做非官方翻譯。
<p>
這意味著我們允許人們寫GPL的譯本，但是我們不會批准它有法律上的有效性和約束力。
<p>
一個未批准的譯本沒有法律效力，需明確說明。應該如下面的樣子標示：
<p>
<pre>
	這個GPL的譯本是非正式的，沒有經過自由軟件基金會的官方批准。要完全確定
	允許的行事准則，請參見原始版本(英文版)。
</pre>
<p>
但是未批准的譯本可以用來幫助理解英文版的GPL。對許多用戶來說，這已經足夠了。
<p>
但是，在商業活動中使用GNU軟件的企業和那些從事公共ftp發布的人來說，應該
查看真正的英文版的GPL來確定那些行為是允許的。
<p>
<LI>
發布的譯本有效性僅限于一個國家。
<p>
我們正在考慮將發布的官方譯本有效性僅限于一個國家。這樣，如果有錯誤，
它也僅限于那個國家，損失也不會太大。
<p>
但這翻譯工作仍要求一個理解GPL精神，能力強的律師擁有高超的專業技能和進行大量的工作
所以我們無法承諾近期有任何這樣的翻譯工作。

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCInterpreterIncompat" NAME="InterpreterIncompat">If
a programming language interpreter has a license that is incompatible
with the GPL, can I run GPL-covered programs on it?</A></h4>

<dd>

When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is yes.
The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; the GPL
doesn't restrict what tools you process the program with.

However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an
example of such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way
are linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them.

So if these facilities are released under a GPL-incompatible license,
the situation is like linking in any other way with a GPL-incompatible
library.  Which implies that:

<ol>
  <li>If you are writing code and releasing it under the GPL, you can
  state an explicit exception giving permission to link it with those
  GPL-incompatible facilities.<p>

  <li>If you wrote and released the program under the GPL, and you
  designed it specifically to work with those facilities, people can
  take that as an implicit exception permitting them to link it with
  those facilities.  But if that is what you intend, it is better
  to say so explicitly.<p>

  <li>You can't take someone else's GPL-covered code and use it that
  way, or add such exceptions to it.  Only the copyright holders of that
  code can add the exception.<p>
</ol>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCWhoHasThePower" NAME="WhoHasThePower">誰有權力強制GPL的執行？</A></h4>

<dd>

Since the GPL is a copyright license, the copyright holders of the
software are the ones who have the power to enforce the GPL.  If you see
a violation of the GPL, you should inform the developers of the
GPL-covered software involved.  They either are the copyright holders,
or are connected with the copyright holders.

因為GPL是一個版權許可証， 軟件的版權持有者有權力強制GPL的執行。如果你
發現有違反GPL的行為，你應該通知這個GPL軟件的開發者。他們或是版權持有者，
或是和版權持有者有聯系。

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCOOPLang" NAME="OOPLang"> In an object-oriented
language such as Java, if I use a class that is GPL'ed without
modifying, and subclass it, in what way does the GPL affect the larger
program?</A></h4>

<dd>
Subclassing is creating a derivative work.  Therefore, the terms of the
GPL affect the whole program where you create a subclass of a GPL'ed
class.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCPortProgramToGL" NAME="PortProgramToGL">If I port
my program to GNU/Linux, does that mean I have to release it as Free
Software under the GPL or some other Free Software license?</A></h4>

<dd>

In general, the answer is no--this is not a legal requirement.  In
specific, the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what
their licenses are.  Most system libraries either use the <A
HREF="/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser GPL</A>, or use the GNU GPL plus an
exception permitting linking the library with anything.  These libraries
can be used in non-free programs; but in the case of the Lesser GPL, it
does have some requirements you must follow.

<p>

Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone; you must use a
GPL-compatible license to use those libraries.  But these are normally
the more specialized libraries, and you would not have had anything much
like them on another platform, so you probably won't find yourself
wanting to use these libraries for simple porting.

<p>

Of course, your software is not a contribution to our community if it is
not free, and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it.
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software,
which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people
to lose their freedom.

<p>

If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that
it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
need to make your software free.

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCCompanyGPLCostsMoney" NAME="CompanyGPLCostsMoney">
I just found out that a company has a copy of a GPL'ed program, and it
costs money to get it.  Aren't they violating the GPL by not making it
available on the Internet?</A></h4>

<dd>

No.  The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for
distribution.  It also does not require anyone in particular to
redistribute the program.  And (outside of one special case), even if
someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes, the GPL
doesn't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular, or any
other person in particular.
<p>
What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a
copy to you <em>if he wishes to</em>.  Once the copyright holder does
distribute a copy program to someone, that someone can then redistribute
the program to you, or to anyone else, as he sees fit.
<p>

<dt><h4><A HREF="#TOCReleaseNotOriginal" NAME="ReleaseNotOriginal"> Can
I release a program with a license which says that you can distribute
modified versions of it under the GPL but you can't distribute the
original itself under the GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>

Such a license would be self-contradictory.  Let's look at its
implications for me as a user.
<p>
Suppose I start with the original version (call it version A), add
some code (let's imagine it is 1000 lines), and release that modified
version (call it B) under the GPL.  The GPL says anyone can change
version B again and release the result under the GPL.  So I (or
someone else) can delete those 1000 lines, producing version C which
has the same code as version A but is under the GPL.
<p>
If you try to block that path, by saying explicitly in the license that
I'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under
the GPL by deleting those lines from version B, in effect the license
now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL
permits.  In other words, the license does not in fact allow a user to
release a modified version such as B under the GPL.
