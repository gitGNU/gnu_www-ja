<H4><A HREF="/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html">How does one use the optional features of the FDL?</A></H4>

We have a <A HREF="/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html">separate page</A> that
discusses how to use the optional features of the FDL.


<P>
<H4>Where must one put the license notification?</H4>

It is sufficient to put the full license notice in the "main" file of
your document.  For example, with the <CITE>Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual</CITE>, we have many files included by <CODE>elisp.texi</CODE>.
We keep the full notification in <CODE>elisp.texi</CODE>, and in the
other files we simply write:

<PRE>
@c -*-texinfo-*-
@c This is part of the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.
@c Copyright (C) 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999
@c   Free Software Foundation, Inc.
@c See the file elisp.texi for copying conditions.

<H4>What do I do with scripts that are needed to render my
document properly ?</H4>

We recommend you release these scripts under the GNU FDL as well.  Of
course, if these scripts are generally useful for other tasks, it is a
good idea to release them separately under the GNU GPL.

<P>

<H4>Is it required for the document to have invariant sections?</H4>

No.  It is perfectly acceptable for a document to have no invariant
sections.
<P>

<H4>Should I try to make sure the document has some invariant
sections?</H4>

Not particularly.  If a section's contents ought to be invariant, make
it invariant.
<P>

<H4>Should I try to avoid invariant sections?</H4>

Not particularly.  If a section's contents ought to be invariant, make
it invariant.
<P>

<H4>When should a section be invariant?</H4>

First of all, keep in mind that a section that treats technical
material <em>cannot</em> be invariant.  Only a secondary section can
be invariant, and a technical section is not a secondary section.
<P>
If the section is text that you're not allowed to modify, such as a
copy of the GNU GPL, then it <em>must</em> be invariant.  You can't
give permission to modify it if you don't have permission to modify
it.
<P>
(One consequence is that you <em>cannot use</em> preexisting text
which covers technical material if you don't have permission to allow
modification of that text.)
<P>
When a section discusses the philosophy of free software, it is a good
idea to make that section invariant.  For instance, when we put the
GNU Manifesto in a manual, or when we include a section explaining why
free documentation is important, we make that section invariant.
