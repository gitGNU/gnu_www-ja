<p>Welcome to issue #48 of the Brave GNU World. Given one issue every
month and 12 issues every year, this obviously means that the Brave
GNU World celebrates its four year anniversary with this issue. More
about this towards the end.</p>

<h3>MagiConf</h3>

<p>One of the points raised frequently by critics of GNU/Linux is that
configuration of hardware is too complicated and not simple enough for
beginners.</p>

<p>MagiConf [5] by Marc Boris D&uuml;rner, Ramesh Panuganty and
Richard Ibbotson seeks to close this gap for the Debian GNU/Linux [6]
distribution, which is the favorite of many people in the community,
but not exactly known for its &quot;end user suitability.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to a library written in C/C++, significant part of system
components can be administrated easily by means of graphical user
interfaces (GUI) based on GNOME/GTK or KDE/Qt<./p>

<p>Currently supported is configuration of the network card and
settings, the sound card, mouse and keyboard for the XFree86 graphical
surface, as well as connected PCMCIA and USB devices.</p>

<p>It should be said that in terms of sound cards, only &quot;Open
Sound System&quot; (OSS) drivers are currently supported. The more
modern and soon to be standard part of the Linux kernel &quot;Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture&quot; (ALSA) [7] is not yet supported. Also
configuring the graphical desktop (XFree86) is not yet possible.</p>

<p>Most likely it is just a matter of time until these will be
supported, however. And if things are not developing fast enough for
your liking, you can certainly speed things up by (also ideal)
support. Today, MagiConf is already supporting the hardware detection
system Discover 2.0 [8] &#8212; this will certainly allow a high
degree of automation and providing useful presets to the users.</p>

<p>The project began more than two years ago as a pure Qt project. But
after the essential functionality had been moved into a library, the
authors were quick to also provide a Gtk+ front end, so both of the
major desktops are supported equally now. As often projects and
distributions only support one of them well, the authors have some
reason to be proud of this.</p>

<p>As a programming language, C++ was used for both the KDE and via
GTKmm also the GTK clients. Licenses used in the project are the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL) for the library and the GNU
General Public License (GPL) for the clients. So the project is
entirely Free Software.</p>

<h3>Moon-Buggy</h3>

<p>After introducing a ncurses based ASCII clone of the console
classic &quot;Space Invaders,&quot; here is some new food for friends
of this genre.</p>

<p>Moon-Buggy [10] by Jochen Voss is an ASCII clone of the game being
very successful under the same name on the Commodore C64 and Amstrad
CPC 464 (sold in Germany under the name &quot;Schneider CPC 464&quot;)
[11].</p>

<p>The player is given the task to drive a Moon-Buggy across a
crater-ridden moon surface without crashing it, so the concept is not
very hard to grasp. But like so many simple games, this one seems
highly addictive.</p>

<p>Proof for that is the grown and true Moon-Buggy fan community,
which even went so far to write robots that could play Moon-Buggy for
them. This came out when following up on a bug report [12] in which a
player reported that the highscore list can only handle 5 digit
scores.</p>

<p>That bug report did cause some surprise because noone expected that
anyone might be able to get that far. Since it takes the robot two
days of continuous play to reach it, that seems quite
understandable.</p>

<p>The game was written around Christmas 1998, when Jochen Voss had
some time to waste. Since then there have been several improvements
and a Debian package by Christian T. Steigies; the project itself is
now essentially stable.</p>

<p>It was written in C with ncurses and runs on pretty much all
somewhat POSIX compliant Unix systems on the shell and console as well
as over ssh connections.</p>

<p>Provided he finds time time for it, Jochen plans to make some final
improvements and maybe even add the Ufo, which is present in the
original, but missing in his program. Then it should finally be ready
for the version 1.0 release.</p>

<p>If you enjoy these little games, Moon-Buggy, which is published as
Free Software under the GNU General Public License (GPL), is your
friend.</p>

<h3>cdcover</h3>

<p>Nowadays, CD writers are spread widely and certainly found in a
large part of homes, so many people will probably know the problems
associated with trying to avoid losing track of all the CDs.</p>

<p>The program cdcover [13] by Roland sch&auml;uble allows creation of
covers and inlets for CD jewelcases in an interactive, comfortable and
easy way. Provided fields are: title, subtitle, text on front- and
backside, footnote and date.</p>

<p>Based upon templates, the program generates postscript files from
that data, which can either be printed directly or viewed in
ghostview.</p>

<p>The project is written in Python; a logical consequence of Rolands
motivation to learn Python by starting this project. He was especially
careful to preserve the platform independence of Python and make
cdcover usable on GNU/Linux (Unix) systems and Win32 alike.</p>

<p>His personal experience with this was that even using Python it is
not very easy to retain platform independence, for instance he has
failed to get the Python-CDDB module to run on Win32 so far.</p>

<p>So the binding to the CDDB data base is currently only available on
GNU/Linux and other Unices, allowing on these platforms to import the
artist, title and index of audio CDs from the internet.</p>

<p>This project, which is released as Free Software under the GNU
General Public License (GPL), is a family project in some way, as the
web page [13] was created by Rolands son, Michele Sch&auml;uble.</p>

<p>Roland sees possible room for improvement of the project especially
in the configuration, which is still done by means of a
&quot;.cdcover&quot; text file.</p>

<p>Working on this as well as adding support for saving data in a more
portable format, for instance XML, is part of Rolands plans for the
future.</p>

<p>Help would be quite welcome, especially in terms of more users and
feeback, as well as more templates.</p>

<h3>GeniusTrader</h3>

<p>There are many niches that have not yet been freed by Free Software
and sometimes projects set out to change that. GeniusTrader [14] by
Fabien Fulhaber is such a project, released under the GNU General
Public License (GPL) as Free Software.</p>

<p>Supported by volunteers like Oliver Bossert, Fabien has begun
creating a toolset for creating and testing automatic trade
systems. According to himself, his project will benefit &quot;people
who wish to get rich on the stock exchange by following signals
generated by a computer.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if the stock fever has cooled down somewhat as a result of the
current depression, the project remains fascinating. Comparable
software currently only exists as very expensive proprietary
solutions, which are not really accessible to normal people.</p>

<p>GeniusTrader offers interested people to simulate and evaluate
trade strategies. So even without the risk of real financial losses a
lot about the stock exchange can be learned.</p>

<p>The project began in 1998, but has been declared dead twice in the
course of its existance, every time because the approach was too broad
and no end in sight. Fabien made the third approach in 2002 and
focused himself on the trade system, around which everything was
assembled.</p>

<p>He currently sees the largest weakness of the project in its
exclusive usage of the commandline, its not providing any graphical
user interface.</p>

<p>Also the project is written in Perl, which requires serious users
to also be proficient in this language; for instance to modify the
module for access to the data base.</p>

<p>Recently some structural changes have been made, so the current
focus is on adapting the remaining modules. Afterwards Fabien hopes to
be able to implement a web frontend.</p>

<p>For this he is still seeking help in form of user feedback and
development contributions by others. In his search for help he even
went as far as buying an ad on LWN, which said: &quot;Want to make
money with free software? Learn Perl and try GeniusTrader&quot;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reactions were not as numerous as he would have
liked them to be, so he now hopes that this issue of the Brave GNU
World will be able to raise some more interest.</p>

<p>Therefore I'd like to ask all readers to maybe also pass this
article on also to others, who might normally not read the column, but
have interest in the stock exchange and its workings.</p>

<h3>Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)</h3>

<p>Securing the legal aspects of Free Software has become increasingly
central recently and its significance increases with more and more
people coming to realize the benefits of Free Software.</p>

<p>Most visible are certainly the spectacular cases, like Jon
Johansen, who was dragged to court in Norwegen on order of the US
media lobby, a case that quickly began revolving around the central
question of whether buying a DVD in a store entitles someone to also
view it. [15]</p>

<p>But also cases like the struggle between MySQl and NuSphere or
trademark issues made news. Be it Adobe forcing kIllustrator to change
their name, or the publisher of the well-known Asterix and Obelix
comics, &quot;Les Éditions Albert René.&quot; In the latter case,
Werner Heuser, who runs an information portal for mobile Unix systems,
was threatened with  50.000 EUR or six months in jail. [16]</p>

<p>One of the reasons these cases are increasing is because Free
Software becomes more visible on the one hand, but seems to be
defenseless against such attacks on the other. In fact Werner Heuser,
who is still fighting against the overmighty publisher, is the
exception.</p>

<p>The everyday legal needs of Free Software are usually much less
spectacular, but not less important, as a legally secured fundament is
a necessary prerequisite for commercial use, for instance.</p>

<p>If we want prevent seeing Free Software pushed into the hobbyist
corner, easily condemning it to insignificance, we must think about
how to preserve the legal security of Free Software.</p>

<p>In this, Free Software has different needs than proprietary
software, which is normally written by a single company, sold for a
while and then discontinued.</p>

<p>Opposed to this, Free Software often has many contributors and is
used for a period that can be seen as &quot;eternal&quot; in the IT
sector. Several of the standard components in use on all GNU/Linux
systems today, are 10-20 years old or even older in some cases.</p>

<p>During their useful life, they are in permanent evolution, but not
only the technical aspects change, the legal basis, on which also the
legal aspects of Free Software are based, is in permanent devlopment,
as has been explained in issue #38 [17] of the Brave GNU World under
the term &quot;Legal Maintainability.&quot;</p>

<p>As briefly announced already in the aforementioned issue, the FSF
Europe has been working on the &quot;Fiduciary Licence Agreement&quot;
(FLA) to address these questions, which has been released on February
4th 2003. [18]</p> 

<p>This agreement allows authors of Free Software to declare the FSF
Europe the legal fiduciary for their projects.</p>

<p>This not only secures projects against the disappearance of
authors, the FSF Europe also takes a significant part of the legal
risks. This allows Free Software to stand eye in eye with companies,
for instance.</p>

<p>For how many projects this can be done naturally depends on the
support and resources, which the FSF Europe will be able to spend on
this task.</p>

<p>In any case the agreement will create the possibility to further
the legal security of Free Software significantly.</p>

<h3>Free Software Laptops</h3>

<p>In the first days of 2003, when I was busy preparing the first Free
Software tours of the year, one week before I had to leave my old
laptop died emitting well-known, unpleasant fumes.</p>

<p>As two weeks on the road without a laptop would have meant not
being able to work for two weeks, we tried (unfortunately without
success) to find a company that might quickly provide a laptop. So on
Friday before the Monday I had to leave, I made my way to a large
electronics discounter.</p>

<p>They had a special offer for a Sony VAIO, which had a very nice
large screen and space for an optional second battery. As working time
without power is a prime criterion for me, I discussed using GNU/Linux
on that machine with one of the salespeople, which he had nothing
really to say about. So I decided to risk it and bought the
laptop.</p>

<p>At home I immediately set to installation, but I couldn't get APM
or ACPI to run no matter what I tried. As neither the handbook nor the
web site contained any useful technical information about the laptop,
I tried until around 3am until I realized that the BIOS of that
particular laptop was crippled in terms of power management, it did
have no functionality for that whatsoever.</p>

<p>All the power management was apparently done by the (preinstalled)
Windows and of course there was no GNU/Linux support. The laptop was
essentially useless.</p>

<p>Next day I brought it back and had them give me back my money,
which I took to another computer store, where I &#8212; after some
testing and consideration &#8212; got myself an Asus laptop that
obviously had a fully ACPI capably BIOS.</p>

<p>With a little persuasion, I got that laptop to give me some of the
functionality that define the usefulness of a laptop. Thanks to a
wasted weekend even in time to be able to get on board my plane with a
fully installed laptop.</p>

<p>Only suspend-to-disk, also called hibernation, I have never been
able to get to work. The AWARD BIOS shipped by Phoenix clearly has
these capabilites, but it is not documented how to let the BIOS know
where to write the memory contents on the hard disk.</p>

<p>So a somewhat bad feeling remains; especially since I dare doubt
that all people will or would be willing to spend as much time on
installing their laptop as I (forcedly) did.</p>

<p>Would cars be sold with special adapters that only allow getting
gas at the gas stations of one specific oil company, this would hardly
be accepted. For laptops this is apparently industry standard.</p>

<p>A situation such as this is inacceptable. It must not be the task
of a hardware vendor to force their customers to use only a specific
piece of software.</p>

<p>Hardware vendors don't have to actively support all operating
systems, normally it would be entirely sufficient if alternatives
weren't blocked intentionally. Currently we have a situation in which
all operating systems but one are deliberately barred from running
fully by hiding essential information about the laptop.</p>

<p>Thanks to the high degree of integration with laptops, the BIOS is
strongly entwined with the hardware. Not to provide information about
how to reach power management functionality is comparable to anonymize
the graphics adapter and hiding information about vendor, model and
specifications.</p>

<p>I would very much like to be able to commend to my readers a vendor
of laptops that does not make headlines by aggressive lobbying for
software patents and offers laptops that truly give their users
freedom and mobility.</p>

<p>Therefore I ask all vendors offering laptops: Give us a laptop with
the necessary specifications and information to be able to use it
entirely! Support the projects for ACPI implementation and integration
with information and allow employees to work with them!</p>

<p>Should some vendor be willing to cater to the needs of the
constantly growing Free Software community and make their laptops
entirely usable, I gladly offer to make this known here and elswhere,
so people can make a good and informed purchase decision.</p>

<p>One good way to reach me is by email. [1]</p>

<h3>Four years Brave GNU World</h3>

<p>So now the Brave GNU World exists for four years &#8212; one more
month if you count the issue that I wasn't able to write. I'd like to
use the occasion to thank all those who have remained true to the
colum as volunteers for translations, proofreaders, web pages, project
recommendations or as readers.</p>

<p>The steady interest during the years was a main factor for me to
keep taking the time for the column every month even when chaos had
broken out or important deadlines were closing in.</p>

<p>After all the time, there are still contributions for the &quot;We
run GNU&quot; initiative [4] started in issue #6 [1]. And there are
still new volunteers who wish to make translations, so recently a
translation into Chinese has been added and soon we may also have a
translation into Catalan. This would bring the number of language the
column is available in up to 10.</p>

<p>I'd like to emphasize that all these helping hands are volunteers
who work in their spare time to make the Brave GNU World accessible to
more people. So if you discover that a translation into some language
is missing, it would clearly be in the spirit of Free Software and the
column to simply get active and get it done.</p>

<p>Everyone who has contributed over the years in one way or another:
you have my personal and very special thanks!</p>

<p>It seems I should at some point start thinking about what to do
next year, because when the column was started, I considered the
danger of a 5 year anniversary to be quite low, actually.</p>

<h3>Enough</h3>

<p>Enough Brave GNU World for this month, as usual I'd like to
encourage comments, ideas, questions and suggestions by mail, [1]
please keep your eyes open for projects that could be made available
to more people through the column.</p>
