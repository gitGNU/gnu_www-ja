 !-- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
 !-- graphics.  It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and
 !-- environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly
 !-- AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.
 !-- R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some
 !-- important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R. 
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
 !-- modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
 !-- classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is
 !-- highly extensible.  The S language is often the vehicle of choice for
 !-- research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source
 !-- route to participation in that activity.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed
 !-- publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
 !-- symbols and formulae where needed.  Great care has been taken over the 
 !-- defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user
 !-- retains full control.
 !-- 
 !-- <H4><A NAME="environment" HREF="#TOCenvironment">The R environment</A></H4>
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data
 !-- manipulation, calculation and graphical display.  It includes
 !-- 
 !-- <UL>
 !-- <LI>an effective data handling and storage facility,
 !-- 
 !-- <LI>a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
 !-- 
 !-- <LI>a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data
 !-- analysis,
 !-- 
 !-- <LI>graphical facilities for data analysis and display either
 !-- on-screen or on hardcopy, and
 !-- 
 !-- <LI>a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which
 !-- includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and
 !-- input and output facilities.
 !-- 
 !-- </UL>
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully
 !-- planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of
 !-- very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other
 !-- data analysis software.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows
 !-- users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much
 !-- of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it
 !-- easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For
 !-- computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked
 !-- and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate
 !-- R objects directly.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- Many users think of R as a statistics system.  We prefer to think of
 !-- it of an environment within which statistical techniques are
 !-- implemented.  R can be extended (easily) via <EM>packages</EM>. There
 !-- are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many
 !-- more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering
 !-- a very wide range of modern statistics.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply
 !-- comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and
 !-- in hardcopy.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- <H4><A HREF="#TOCdownloading" NAME="downloading">Downloading R</A></H4>
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- R can be found on <tt><A
 !-- HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</A></tt>,
 !-- the master site of comprehensive R archive network, or at one of its
 !-- <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">mirrors</a>.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- It is available as source code and as binary distributions for a
 !-- number of GNU/Linux and Unix platforms, and for versions of Microsoft
 !-- Windows that support long file names.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- <H4><A HREF="#TOCfaq" NAME="FAQ">More information</A></H4>
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- R comes with an <a
 !-- href="http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html">FAQ</a> list, and an
 !-- introduction to the language and how to use R for doing statistical
 !-- analysis and graphics in <a
 !-- href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">PDF</a> and
 !-- other formats.
 !-- 
 !-- <P>
 !-- Further manuals and documentation (including in French and Spanish)
 !-- are discussed in the FAQ and in the <a
 !-- href="http://cran.r-project.org/#doc">documentation</a> section on
 !-- CRAN.
