<h2>Gtkeditor</h2>

<p>Gtkeditor is no longer useful, as version 2 of GTK+ has a much
improved text widget making the gtkeditor extensions unnecessary.  So it
has been decomissioned as a GNU package.

<p>The <a href="http://gtkeditor.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge project
page for gtkeditor</a> still exists.
