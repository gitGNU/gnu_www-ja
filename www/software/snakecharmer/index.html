<p>GNU SnakeCharmer (related to <a href="/software/gift/">GNU GIFT</a>)
has been decommissioned, since it never came to fruition.  But if you're
interested in working on it, it can always be revived!  Please take a
look at this <a href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general
information about GNU packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then
email maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and
particular interest.  Thanks.</p>
