<h2>Java and GNU</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Java</h3>

<p>As a starting point, here are the two major packages and a couple of
other links related to Java and the GNU project:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a>, essential
    libraries for Java.</li>

<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">GCJ</a>, the GNU compiler for the
    Java programming language.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-welcomes-gpl-java.html">Sun
    begins releasing Java under the GPL</a>, news release from the Free
    Software Foundation.</li>

<li><a href="/philosophy/java-trap.html">Free but Shackled - the Java
    Trap</a>, happily no longer directly applicable to Java, but still
    an important lesson to heed in the future.</li>
</ul>

     be under CC BY-ND 3.0 US.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the

     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
