<H3>GNU Nana: improved support for assertion checking and logging in 
GNU C/C++</H3>
<P>
GNU Nana is a free library providing improved support for assertion
checking (as in <code>assert.h</code>) and logging
(<code>printf</code> style debugging) in GNU C and C++. It provides
support for some of the ideas of Eiffel, VDM, Z and Anna in GNU C/C++.
GNU Nana was developed by Phil Maker.

<P>
For full documentation, see the online manual available at <A
HREF="/software/nana/manual/">www.gnu.org/software/nana/manual/nana.html</A>.

<H4>Features</H4>
<P>
<UL>

<LI> Space/time efficient, at least compared to assert.h. For example
<CODE>assert(i &gt;= 0)</CODE> uses 53 bytes on the x86,
while Nana uses either 10 bytes or 1.

<LI> Support for predicate calculus (``for all,'' ``exists,'' and so
on) is provided using both C style for loops and C++ STL iterators
over container classes.

<LI> Assertions can refer to saved state; for exaple, the return value
of a sort function can be checked against the arguments on function
entry.

<LI> Logging messages can be redirected to a variety of destinations 
including files, processes (for automated testing or visualisation) or
circular buffers in core.

<LI> Assertions about time can be made in a simple manner.

<LI> Lists of invariant checking or printing functions can be created
which can then be called to check internal consistency or display state.

<LI> All of the features can be selectively enabled or disabled at both
compile and run time.

</UL>

<P> 
<H4>Why is this useful?</H4> 
<P> 

<UL> 

<LI> The sooner an error is detected, the cheaper it is to
fix. Error correction is a (the) major cost in software development. 

<LI> Recording what the system is doing before it goes off into
``never never land'' is very useful.

<LI> ``This style (Design by Contract) of analysis avoids a classic
dilemma of analysis and specification: either you use a programming
notation and run the risk of making premature implementation
commitments; or you stick with a higher level notation (``bubbles and
arrows'') and you must remain vague, forsaking one of the major
benefits of the analysis process, the ability to state and clarify
delicate properties of the system'' - ISE Inc.
