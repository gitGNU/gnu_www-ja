<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC5">Installing the Nana library</A></H1>
<P>
Nana uses the normal GNU install method in the same way as <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP>. To install nana in the default location
<SAMP>`/usr/local/{bin,lib,include}'</SAMP> you would use:

</P>

<PRE>
% gzcat nana-1.10.tar.gz | tar xvf -
% cd nana-1.10
% ./configure 
% make
% make install
% make check
% make check-mail
% make subscribe 
</PRE>

<P>
The <VAR>check-mail</VAR> and <VAR>subscribe</VAR> targets both send e-mail. If
you need to change the mailer used try something like:

</P>

<PRE>
% make MAIL=elm subscribe
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> we need to install nana before running the <SAMP>`make check'</SAMP> 
target. The <SAMP>`check-mail'</SAMP> target sends the test report
via e-mail to the <SAMP>`nana-bug@cs.ntu.edu.au'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Of course things are never that simple.  If you want to install Nana in
a different location or change the behaviour on error detection see section <A HREF="nana_8.html#SEC8">Configure</A>.

</P>
<P>
Each of the sub-directories nana can be compiled and installed
separately, e.g. if you don't need the documentation you can just
compile and install from the <SAMP>`src'</SAMP> sub-directory after doing the
configure statement.
