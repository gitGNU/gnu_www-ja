<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC18">WITHOUT_NANA: disabling all nana code for portability.</A></H2>
<P>
If you wish to disable all nana code you can <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP> the
<SAMP>`WITHOUT_NANA'</SAMP> macro. This selects versions of the 
macros defined in <SAMP>`I.h'</SAMP>,<SAMP>`L.h'</SAMP>, etc which map to 
<SAMP>`/* empty */'</SAMP>. 

</P>
<P>
So if you are using nana for your development but don't wish to 
force  your customers to use it you can add an option to your
<SAMP>`configure'</SAMP> script to define/undefine <SAMP>`WITHOUT_NANA'</SAMP>. 
In addition you will need to distribute copies of the nana header
files with your package to get the stubs.

</P>
<P>
Note that the <SAMP>`L.h'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`DL.h'</SAMP> macros use the 
macro variable number of arguments extension provided by 
GNU C. If you wish your code to be portable you should use
the macros <SAMP>`VL((..))'</SAMP>, etc rather than <SAMP>`L(..)'</SAMP> to
avoid problems with non GNU C preprocessors which only take a fixed
number of arguments.
