<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC11">Supported Debuggers</A></H2>

<P>
Currently Nana works with the GNU GDB debugger which is available on a
wide range of platforms including embedded systems and even provides
support for remote debugging. 
Porting to any reasonable debugger with conditional
breakpoints and commands is not very difficult. 

</P>
<P>
As an example of an unreasonable debugger, Nana has been ported to
work with the MicroSoft Codeview debugger. The port is small (60 lines of
code) but suffers from a problem with variable scoping in Codeview. If
a breakpoint is set at a point in the code the expressions are not
evaluated from that particular scope. For example setting a breakpoint
in the function <CODE>f</CODE> cannot access a variable local to <CODE>f</CODE>
directly. Codeview has a unique (expletive deleted) scope operator
which you must use to set the scope <SAMP>`{...}'</SAMP>.  This makes the
interface somewhat less than beautiful.

</P>
<P>
Another good thing about CodeView is to try a debug command which prints a
message which contains a single open <SAMP>`{'</SAMP>. This of course causes it
to hang and was the main problem during the porting to CodeView which
took a whole day<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="nana_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>. 

</P>
<P>
If anyone is interested I may release the CodeView implementation,
please contact me if you are interested. Of course a better bet is probably 
to move to the <SAMP>`gdbserver'</SAMP> system. I think <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP> has been released
as a native even for some MicroSoft operating systems.

</P>
<P>
Other debuggers like DBX don't seem to be worth the trouble since gdb
works on those machines. A redesign of the nana internals may also be useful
if we decide portability between debuggers is actually useful.
