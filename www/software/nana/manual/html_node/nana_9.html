<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC9">Variables for ./configure</A></H2>
<P>
The configure program uses the following shell variables to change
various defaults.  Another method is simply to edit the 
<SAMP>`nana-config.h'</SAMP> file. Most of these values should be auto detected,
so you can ignore this section until your need to save a few 
bytes of store by using <SAMP>`asm("hlt")'</SAMP> instead of a call to 
<SAMP>`abort()'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>DI_MAKE_VALID_BREAKPOINT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
This text is inserted when the <SAMP>`DI.h'</SAMP> library needs to set a
breakpoint in the generated code. It should ideally update all
variables which being kept in registers etc so that gdb gets the
correct values for each variable.

Possible values include:


<OL>
<LI><SAMP>`asm("nop")'</SAMP> -- a single <SAMP>`nop'</SAMP> instruction to set the

breakpoint at.

This is the default.

<LI><SAMP>`_vi = 0'</SAMP> -- where <SAMP>`_vi'</SAMP> is a global volatile int.

<LI><SAMP>`_vi = (exprn)'</SAMP> -- where <VAR>exprn</VAR> is the expression

we are checking for this assertion.
<LI><SAMP>`/* nothing */'</SAMP> -- nothing at all, this means the breakpoint

will be set at the start of the next statement which works most of the
time. However for some examples this will do the wrong thing.
</OL>

<DT><CODE>DL_MAKE_VALID_BREAKPOINT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
Used for the same purpose as <SAMP>`DI_MAKE_VALID_BREAKPOINT'</SAMP> for
<SAMP>`DL.h'</SAMP>. It also defaults to <SAMP>`asm("nop")'</SAMP>.
<DT><CODE>I_DEFAULT_HANDLER</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
The code called when <SAMP>`I.h'</SAMP> detects an error.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>asm("hlt")</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
Some machines use a <SAMP>`hlt'</SAMP> instruction.
<DT><CODE>asm("stp")</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
And other machines use a <SAMP>`stp'</SAMP> instruction.
<DT><CODE>abort()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
Or we could use a call to <SAMP>`abort'</SAMP> which is at least standard C. On
some machines this is significantly larger than a single <SAMP>`hlt'</SAMP>
instruction. 
<DT><CODE>restart()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
Or a call to a function which attempts to restart the system.
</DL>
<DT><CODE>ALWAYS_INCLUDE_MALLOC</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
This is a dodgey for some versions of Linux which don't seem to include 
<SAMP>`malloc'</SAMP> when you include <SAMP>`stdio.h'</SAMP> and use <SAMP>`print'</SAMP>. This
causes problems for <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP> since it uses <SAMP>`malloc'</SAMP> in the
executable to implement parts of its functionality. 

This kludge should be removed!
