<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC30">assert.h: a drop in replacement for assert.h</A></H2>
<P>
A drop in replacement for <SAMP>`assert.h'</SAMP> is provided in the <SAMP>`src'</SAMP>
directory. It is <STRONG>not</STRONG> installed by default. If you wish to use
it then you need to copy it to your include directory by hand.

</P>
<P>
This might be of use if you are already using <SAMP>`assert.h'</SAMP> and
wish to save some code space since the nana implementation is more 
space efficient. 

</P>
<P>
Calls to <SAMP>`assert'</SAMP> are translated to calls to <SAMP>`I'</SAMP> and 
can be disabled by defining <SAMP>`NDEBUG'</SAMP>.
