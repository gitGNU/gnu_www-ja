<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC36">Embedded Systems: testing non-deterministic systems.</A></H2>
<P>
One of the uses (in fact the original use) for nana is in the 
testing of non-deterministic systems. These systems behave in a 
different way each time they are run because of timing or measurement
noise. Thus you can't just <SAMP>`diff'</SAMP> the results against a known good run
since they run differently each time.

<P>
Instead you can use a series of programs which execute over a 
the results of the program and check that the behaviour meets the
specification automatically.
