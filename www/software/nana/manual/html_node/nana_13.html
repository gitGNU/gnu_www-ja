<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC13">Bug Reports</A></H2>

<P>
If you think you have found a bug in the Nana library, please
investigate it and report it.  

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Please make sure that the bug is really in the Nana library.

<LI>You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to

reproduce the bug.
<LI>You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if the

results printed are not good and in that case, in what way.
Make sure that the bug report includes all information you would
need to fix this kind of bug for someone else.  
</UL>

<P>
If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we won't do
anything about it (apart from asking you to send better bug reports).

</P>
