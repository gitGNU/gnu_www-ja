<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="nana_toc.html#TOC6">Required Software</A></H2>
<P>
The following software is possibly required to run nana.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>gcc-2.7.2</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
Nana makes use of two GNU extensions in its library so you really should
be using <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>. Some of the code can be used with any C compiler,
though it may not be worth the bother. The dependencies on gcc are in 
<SAMP>`Q.h'</SAMP> which uses the statement value extension and in <SAMP>`L.h'</SAMP>
which uses the variable number of arguments extension to <SAMP>`cpp'</SAMP>.
<DT><CODE>gdb-4.16</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
A recent version of <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP> is worthwhile, some early 4.?? versions
had problems setting a large number of breakpoints.
<DT><CODE>gmake</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
The <SAMP>`configure'</SAMP> script and <SAMP>`Makefiles'</SAMP> are generated using the
<SAMP>`automake'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`autoconf'</SAMP> programs. They should be reasonably
portable but if you have problems try using GNU make. For example on
some old DEC boxes we have had strange behaviour using the system make.
