<P>
This section describes the details of the interface to nana library.

</P>
<P>
All of the files can be included multiple times without
ill--effect since they use the C preprocessor to make sure the header
declarations are only seen the first by the compiler.
Each of the files can also be included individually.

</P>

<P>
If any of the following routines have an internal problem (e.g. malloc
fails due to lack of memory) they will call the <SAMP>`nana_error'</SAMP> function
defined in <SAMP>`nana_error.c'</SAMP>. By default this function prints a message
and dumps core using <SAMP>`abort'</SAMP>. If you wish to override this behaviour
you should define your own handler before linking in the nana library.
