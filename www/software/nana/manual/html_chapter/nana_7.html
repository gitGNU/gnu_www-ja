<P>
As usual, there is more work to be done than time to do it in.
Workers or test pilots are invited to apply for the following
tasks which may get down in the fullness of time minister. 
I'm particularly interested in which projects people think 
are worthwhile (or rubbish).

</P>

<OL>
<LI>Ada support - pre 1.00 versions of nana provided support for

        Ada. Adding a full version of nana into the GNATS compiler 
        would probably be useful, particularly the real time part.
<LI>FORTRAN support.

<LI>Message browsing (<SAMP>`emacs/fess.el'</SAMP>) - a very prototypical mode for

browsing message logs is distributed with nana. Features include hiding/showing
lines by regular expression or predicate. If someone who knows what they
are doing rewrites this that would be a good thing. Or perhaps a modified
version of <SAMP>`less'</SAMP> would be useful.
<LI>Program Visualisation (<SAMP>`tcl/status.c'</SAMP>) - another prototype

which uses a small TCL/TK library and nana logging to generate some 
nice pictures showing the behaviour of the program. For example
the history of variables over time can be recorded, graphs drawn and
long message logs kept. A new version of this has been created
and may be released shortly. 
<LI>Eiffel shortform program - the shortform of an Eiffel program

contains the function signatures (arguments, etc) together with the
assertions (pre/post conditions). 
An extension could perhaps be put in a
program such as <SAMP>`DOC++'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`cxref'</SAMP> which extracts the 
nana assertions.
<LI>Automated Testing - combine nana logs with a workbench

that lets you verify properties of the logs using programs <SAMP>`gawk'</SAMP>
or the <SAMP>`PRECC'</SAMP> (LL infinity version of YACC). This technique has
been used on industrial strength products quite successfully. 
<LI>GNU standards - perhaps it would be worthwhile to set up

a prototype for checking and logging in GNU tools. 
<LI>Extend GDB(1) so that we can support <SAMP>`Q.h'</SAMP> style quantifiers

in <SAMP>`DI.h'</SAMP> expressions. Basically we need to add a restricted form 
of the statement value expression to GDB.
<LI>Support for other (particularly ANSI only) compilers.
