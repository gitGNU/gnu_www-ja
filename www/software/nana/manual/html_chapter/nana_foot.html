<H1>GNU Nana</H1>
<H2>Improved support for assertions and logging in C and C++</H2>
<H2>last updated 27 February 1998 for version 1.14</H2>
<ADDRESS>P.J.Maker (<A HREF="mailto:pjm@cs.ntu.edu.au">pjm@cs.ntu.edu.au</A>)</ADDRESS>

<H3><A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="nana_1.html#DOCF1">(1)</A></H3>
<P>Which is unfortunately quite uncommon in
the authors experience.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="nana_2.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>And about 60 reset cycles where the machine
went off into hyperspace
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="nana_2.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>This allows variable number of arguments to
C preprocessor macros.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>If you don't want a core dump then look at stopping the core
dumps with <CODE>ulimit</CODE> rather than changing the handler.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>Side-effects
include such operations as input/output or assignments, e.g. <SAMP>`x++'</SAMP>
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>Side-effects
include operations like input/output or assignments.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF7">(7)</A></H3>
<P>This was suggested by Phil Blecker.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF8">(8)</A></H3>
<P>ANSI C does not allow
variable declarations at the beginning of loops unlike C++. The
 <SAMP>`Q.h'</SAMP> macros get around this by starting each loop with a new
scope.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF9">(9)</A></H3>
<P>This uses yet
another GNU CC extension, however since we are already using statement 
expressions we might as well use <SAMP>`typeof'</SAMP> as well.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="nana_4.html#DOCF10">(10)</A></H3>
<P>In
the fullness of time, we may integrate these routines in here.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="nana_5.html#DOCF11">(11)</A></H3>
<P>Of course you also need to use the gdb commands
generated by the <SAMP>`nana'</SAMP> command, perhaps using <SAMP>`nana-clg'</SAMP>
<H3><A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="nana_5.html#DOCF12">(12)</A></H3>
<P>Gordon Matzigkeit contributed some of the 
ideas presented here and raised this problem.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT13" HREF="nana_5.html#DOCF13">(13)</A></H3>
<P>Or add a <SAMP>`--with-nana'</SAMP> flag
to configure that does the opposite.
