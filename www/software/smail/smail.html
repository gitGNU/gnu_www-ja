<h2>Smail</h2>

<p>Smail (a mail transport agent) is free software, but it
is not a GNU package.  However, the GNU web site has long had this page
about it, so it will remain for reference.

<p>For more information and to download the software, please see the <a
href="http://www.weird.com/~woods/projects/smail.html">smail home
page</a>.
