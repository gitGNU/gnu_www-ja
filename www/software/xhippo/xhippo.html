    <P>GNU xhippo is a generic playlist manager program for a variety
      of Unix sound players. It's been shown to work with mpg123,
      bplay, s3mod, tracker, xmp and timidity, and should work with
      more-or-less anything that can take a filename on the command
      line. (The latest versions of all of these players may be found
      through Freshmeat's
      <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/appindex/">Appindex</a>.) It is
      capable of automatically deciding which player to use depending
      on a file's extension; the defaults are set in a config file. It
      uses textual playlist files, which are easily generated with the
      ``find'' or ``locate'' utilities (and are compatible with most
      other Unix sound players). xhippo's interface is very loosely
      modelled on the ``HippoPlayer'' player for the Amiga.

    <P>xhippo was developed under Debian GNU/Linux, but it contains
      nothing Linux-specific, so it will probably work on any
      Unix-like system where gcc, glib, getopt_long and GTK are
      available; standard "ports" are available for NetBSD and
      FreeBSD. xhippo will optionally integrate with the GNOME
      desktop, supporting GNOME themes and drag-and-drop, and supports
      specific GTK themes through its own <tt>gtkrc</tt>. xhippo can
      optionally read the ID3 tags from MP3 files, and has
      randomisation features ensuring that you don't hear the same
      song over and over again.

    <p>xhippo is highly configurable both at compile-time and at
      runtime, and supports both German and English interfaces.
