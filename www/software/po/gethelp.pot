"Many companies now redistribute GNU software, often as part of a <a "
"href=\"/distros/free-distros.html\">GNU/Linux distribution</a>.  When you "
"find bugs in a GNU program that you installed with a given GNU/Linux "
"distribution, please first try reporting the bug directly to the "
"distributor, not to us, using the distributor's mailing lists or web forms.  "
"It is common for distributors to modify the original GNU software we release "
"(as they are free to do!), and/or distribute older versions.  The "
"maintainers of the original GNU packages usually have no knowledge of what "
"particular distributors have done."

"Otherwise, look for the home page of the package.  Usually this is "
"<code>http://www.gnu.org/software/</code><em>pkgname</em>.  If this doesn't "
"work or you don't know the package name, information for all GNU packages is "
"included in the FSF <a href=\"http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GNU/\">Free "
"Software Directory</a>.  The home page should also be prominently mentioned "
"in the package documentation or README files, and is often findable with a "
"general Internet search."

"When we receive a bug report for our canonical releases, we usually try to "
"fix the problem.  While our bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, "
"they are not; they are part of preparing a new improved version.  We may "
"send you a patch for a bug so that you can help us test the fix and ensure "
"its quality.  If your bug report does not evoke a solution from us, you may "
"still get one from another user who reads our bug report mailing lists."

"best approach is to put the files on the web and include a url in your "
