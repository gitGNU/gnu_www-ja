"The Free Software Foundation does not provide warranties for its software.  "
"We can't afford to.  So we can't promise that GNU software has no Year 2000 "
"bugs, any more than we could promise you the same thing about another sort "
"of bug.  But we can tell you some reasons why such bugs are probably very "
"few."

"The main reason is theoretical.  GNU systems, and Unix-like systems "
"generally, represent a date/time as a 32-bit integer, counting seconds from "
"the beginning of 1970.  This 32-bit count will overflow in 2038; but there "
"will be no problem in that year, because by then all systems will have "
"redefined <code>time_t</code> to be a 64-bit integer."

"We also have some practical evidence that such problems are not widespread.  "
"Some users running a <a href=\"/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\">Linux-based GNU "
"system</a>, specifically Debian GNU/Linux, used their machines for a while "
"with the clocks set forward to the year 2000.  They reported no special "
"problems."

"You can check that you are using the latest release of any particular GNU "
"program by checking one of our <a href=\"/prep/ftp.html\">FTP mirror "
"sites</a>.  The <code>ls-lR</code> file in the root directory of one of our "
"FTP servers could be useful to get a list of all available versions."
