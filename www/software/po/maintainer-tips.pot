"If you are new to maintaining a GNU package, whether one that you have "
"offered to GNU or an existing one that you have adopted, it can be "
"overwhelming to know where to start.  The official email notice you received "
"when you became a GNU maintainer has lots of details; this document is not a "
"replacement for that email, but rather a complement, aiming to provide some "
"tips on getting started."

"Of course, what's listed here just skims the surface of GNU maintainership.  "
"Please be sure to read the <a href=\"/prep/maintain/\">GNU Maintainers "
"Guide</a> and the <a href=\"/prep/standards/\">GNU Coding Standards</a>.  "
"Indeed, you should have read them already, but they are densely enough "
"written that careful re-readings are useful.  In addition, a few experienced "
"GNU contributors have volunteered to answer questions about GNU maintenance "
"via mentors@gnu.org as well as maintainers@gnu.org."

"<b>Aim for a quick first release.</b> Whether your package is new or you've "
"adopted an older one, your number one priority should be making a first "
"release as soon as possible.  If you've adopted a package, it's sufficient "
"to fix a few bugs and push that out.  In fact, just updating the "
"infrastructure files (e.g., Autoconf/Automake, gnulib modules, etc.) is "
"enough to justify a new release when you've first taken over a package.  If "
"your package is new, don't be afraid to put out an early version that is not "
"yet feature complete.  In any case, a release (with <a "
"href=\"/prep/maintain/html_node/Announcements.html\">proper "
"announcements</a>) will draw attention to your package in the form of "
"potential users or even other developers.  It is the best way to let people "
"know that an old package has been revived or that a new package exists at "
"all.  (<a href=\"/prep/maintain/html_node/Distributions.html\">About making "

"<b>Focus on fixing outstanding bugs first.</b> An excellent way to begin to "
"learn a new codebase is to fix some outstanding bugs to get a feel for how "
"the system works.  Besides, new features shouldn't be given much focus if "
"notable problems already exist.  (<a href=\"/software/devel.html\">About "

"<b>Don't try to rewrite the entire thing.</b> If you've adopted a package, "
"we strongly recommend that you not set out to rewrite the whole program from "
"scratch.  While always tempting, and an easy thing to start, completing it "
"successfully requires a colossal effort, and experience has shown that it is "
"an almost sure-fire way to become demotivated and lead to eventual "
"(re-)stagnation of the project.  Instead, focus on incremental "
"improvements.  Once you've become intimately familiar with the package, you "
"will be in a better position to consider more radical changes."
