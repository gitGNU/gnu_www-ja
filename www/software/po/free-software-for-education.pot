"Here are two lists of high-quality free/libre software applications that can "
"be used in schools and educational institutions of all levels. The first one "
"is a list of free/libre programs along with the popular proprietary "
"applications they replace. The second one contains free/libre programs that "
"do not necessarily replace a proprietary counterpart but can be very useful "
"to students and teachers."

"All these programs are released under a license that is granted for zero "
"price and does not expire. While we are glad that schools can also save "
"money with these programs, avoiding miseducation (teaching dependence on "
"nonfree software) is a more important imperative: when we say these programs "
"are <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a>, <strong>we are "
"talking about freedom, not price</strong>. It means that you are free to use "
"them constructively, either alone or in a community, while respecting the "
"freedom of others."

"Everyone should use free software, because only free software gives users "
"the freedom to control their own computers. However, there are <a "

"In addition to the wrong of nonfree software, the use of third-party network "
"services in schools poses yet another problem: <a "

"the collection of students (and teachers) personal data by companies</a>."

"But even if the school never used those services, it could not be sure that "
"the machines are not sending data. In fact, the source code of proprietary "
"programs (with a few exceptions) is secret, so users don't know what the "
"software is really doing."
