<h2>Free Software for iOS</h2>

<p>
Here is a list of free iOS programs which can also run on
<a href="https://www.replicant.us/">Replicant</a> and/or
can exchange data with Replicant programs&mdash;along with the proprietary
applications they replace.  Using these programs is only
a small step toward freedom, and
<strong>we urge all iOS users to switch to
<a href="https://www.replicant.us/supported-devices.php">a mobile device that supports Replicant</a>
(or a free <a href="/distros/free-distros.html">GNU/Linux distribution</a>)
as soon as possible</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We have long had
<a href="/software/for-windows.html">a page which lists free replacements
for popular Windows programs</a>
as a first step towards replacing Windows with GNU/Linux.
Someone suggested making a similar page for iOS, but the two cases are
quite different.  Windows can be easily replaced with a free operating system on
most PCs, but not iOS: there are ways to
install
<a href="/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">Android</a>
on some iThings, but its free counterpart,
Replicant, cannot be installed on any of them.
</p>

<p>
These reasons (along with <a href="/proprietary/malware-apple.html">other
reasons listed on our page dedicated to Apple malware</a>)
could be sufficient for us to avoid recommending any iOS apps altogether;
however, we feel that it is
valid and useful to list those few free programs which can also run on
Replicant or can interoperate with programs on Replicant.

    This is a selection of Replicant-compatible
    free software applications available for iOS
    platform, and is nothing like a comprehensive list.
    You may want to check the <a
    href="//directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category/Runs-on/iOS">
    Runs-on/iOS category</a> in our Free Software Directory
    for more software. 
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are technically minded, you may find it interesting to build
    these apps from source code rather than download them from the App Store.

<dt id="OnionBrowser"><a href="https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/">OnionBrowser</a> <span
class="anchor-reference-id">(<a

<dd>
  <p>
  OnionBrowser is a free web browser which encrypts all web traffic through
  the Tor network.
  </p>

  <p>
  On Replicant, similar functionality is offered by
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=info.guardianproject.browser">Orweb</a>,
  or by running
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android">Orbot</a>
  along with a web browser with proxy support.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt id="OwnCloud"><a href="https://owncloud.com/products/mobileapps/">ownCloud</a> <span
class="anchor-reference-id">(<a
href="https://github.com/owncloud/iOS/">source code</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    ownCloud is a free file synchronization and sharing program. Both the
    client and the server are free, so it is possible to self-host a server
    on the users' own machine(s) without involving any third-parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    ownCloud is available on many platforms, including
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.owncloud.android">Replicant</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: While we have nothing against accessing your own server from your own
    mobile devices, we believe the term &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo;
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#CloudComputing">should be avoided</a>.
  </p>

<dt id="Signal"><a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> <span
class="anchor-reference-id">(<a
href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS">source code</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    Signal is also available on Replicant, although the fully free version is known as
    <a href="https://fdroid.eutopia.cz/">LibreSignal</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: Signal was previously removed from the iOS list because the Android version
    required Google Cloud Messaging, a proprietary component.
    Now there's an unofficial build of Signal called LibreSignal which does
    not use GCM on Android, <b>but it can only send text messages.</b>
  </p>
</dd>

<dt id="VLC"><a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html">VideoLAN Client (VLC)</a></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  VLC (initially VideoLAN Client) is a highly portable
  multimedia player for various audio and video formats
  (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, MP3, OGG, etc.) as well as
  DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. It can also
  be used as a server to stream in unicast or multicast in
  IPv4 or IPv6 on a high-bandwidth network.
  </p>

  <p>
  VLC is also available
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.videolan.vlc">on Replicant</a>.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt id="Vim"><a href="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/">Vim</a> <span
class="anchor-reference-id">(<a
href="https://github.com/applidium/Vim">source code</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  Vim is a free extensible command-based text editor.
  </p>

  <p>
  On Replicant, a version of Vim optimized for touch screens called
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=net.momodalo.app.vimtouch">VimTouch</a>
  is available.
