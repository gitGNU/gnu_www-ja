<title>GNU Ethical Repository Criteria

<h2>GNU ethical repository criteria</h2>

<p>We developed these criteria to judge services for hosting parts of
the GNU operating system, but we recommend them to everyone that wants
to use a service for publicly hosting free source code (and optionally
executable programs too).  The criteria emphasize protection of
privacy, functionality without
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/freejs">nonfree JavaScript</a>,
compatibility with copyleft licensing and philosophy, and not
rejecting any users.</p>

<p>GNU also maintains <a
href="/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html">evaluations of
code-hosting sites</a> by the standards of these criteria.  If you'd
like to help us evaluate more sites or update existing evaluations as
sites improve (or worsen) their scores, join the <a
href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/repo-criteria-discuss">repo-criteria-discuss</a>
mailing list.</p>

<h3>Version 1.1</h3>

<h4 id="F">F &mdash; Unacceptable</h4>

<h4 id="C">C &mdash; Acceptable hosting for a GNU package</h4>
  <ul>
    <li id="C0"><p>All important site functionality that's enabled for use
        with that package works correctly (though it need not look
        as nice) in free browsers, including
        <a href="/software/gnuzilla/">IceCat</a>,
        without running any nonfree software sent by the
        site.  <strong>(C0)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li id="C0-0"><p>Regarding sending code that runs on the JavaScript
          platform, any such code used by an important site
          function either (1) is free software, and labeled
          properly for
          <a href="/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a>
          to recognize as free, or (2) isn't necessary, so that
          the function works properly even if JavaScript is
          disabled in the browser.</p>
        <p>See <a href="/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">The JavaScript Trap</a> for more explanation.</p>
        <p>Note that free software must come with the real
          source code.  Minified JavaScript code, and code
          generated by translation from some other language, are
          not source code.  They are a kind of object code.
          <strong>(C0.0)</strong></p></li>

      <li id="C0-1"><p>Regarding sending code that executes based on a
          platform other than JavaScript, those conditions apply,
          mutatis mutandis.  In addition, a free implementation of
          that platform, and a free program to check for free
          licensing (comparable to LibreJS for JavaScript), must be
          available for the principal GNU browser IceCat, and the
          site must work adequately with them.</p>
        <p>Using JavaScript code to interpret some other
          language counts as using the JavaScript
          platform.  Translating another language into JavaScript
          code and sending that JavaScript code also constitutes
          use of the JavaScript platform.  In the former case, free
          JavaScript-platform code means that the interpreter and
          the programs it interprets are free software.  In the
          latter case, free JavaScript-platform code means that
          the code people maintain, which is input to the
          translator, is free software; we also require that a
          free translator exist which is adequate for the
          translation job.  <strong>(C0.1)</strong></p></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="C1"><p>No other nonfree software is required to use the
        site (thus, no Flash).  <strong>(C1)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="C2"><p>Does not discriminate against classes of users, or
        against any country.  <strong>(C2)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="C3"><p>Permits access via Tor (we consider this an
        important site function). <strong>(C3)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="C4"><p>The site's terms of service contain no odious
        conditions.  <strong>(C4)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="C5"><p>Recommends and encourages GPL 3-or-later licensing at
        least as much as any other kind of licensing.  <strong>(C5)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="C6"><p>Support HTTPS properly and securely, including the site's
        certificates.  <strong>(C6)</strong></p></li>
  </ul>

<h4 id="B">B &mdash; Good enough to recommend</h4>
    <p>The above criteria, plus:</p>

  <ul>
    <li id="B0"><p>All code sent to the user's browser must be free
        software and labeled for LibreJS or other suitable free
        automatic license analyzer, regardless of whether the site
        functions when the user disables this code.
        <strong>(B0)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="B1"><p>Does not report visitors to other organizations; in
        particular, no tracking tags in the pages. This means the
        site must avoid most advertising networks.
        <strong>(B1)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="B2"><p>Does not encourage bad licensing practices (no
        license, unclear licensing, GPL N only).
        <strong>(B2)</strong></p></li>

    <li id="B3"><p>Does not recommend nonfree licenses for works of
        practical use.  <strong>(B3)</strong></p></li>
  </ul>

<h4 id="A">A &mdash; Excellent</h4>
  <p>The above criteria, plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li id="A0"><p>All important site functions work correctly (though may not
      look as nice) when the user disables execution of JavaScript
      and other code sent by the
      site.  <strong>(A0)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A1"><p>Server code released as free software.
      <strong>(A1)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A2"><p>Encourages use of GPL 3-or-later as preferred option.
      <strong>(A2)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A3"><p>Offers use of AGPL 3-or-later as an option.
      <strong>(A3)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A4"><p>Does not permit nonfree licenses (or lack of license) for
      works for practical use. <strong>(A4)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A5"><p>Does not recommend services that
      are <a href="/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">SaaSS</a>.
      <strong>(A5)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A6"><p>Says &ldquo;free software,&rdquo; not &ldquo;open
      source.&rdquo;  <strong>(A6)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A7"><p>Clearly endorses the Free Software Movement's ideas of
      freedom.  <strong>(A7)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A8"><p>Avoids saying &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; without &ldquo;GNU&rdquo;
      when referring to GNU/Linux.  <strong>(A8)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A9"><p>Insists that each nontrivial file in a package clearly and
   unambiguously state how it is licensed. <strong>(A9)</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="A-plus">A+ &mdash; Extra credit</h4>

<p>The above criteria, plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li id="A-plus-0"><p>Allows visitors to look and download without authenticating.
      <strong>(A+0)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A-plus-1"><p>Does not log anything about visitors.
      <strong>(A+1)</strong></p></li>

  <li id="A-plus-2"><p>Follows the criteria in The Electronic Frontier
      Foundation's <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/osp">best
        practices for online service providers</a>.
      <strong>(A+2)</strong></p></li>
