"source code is available, so that you can study the software, adapt it to "
"your needs, fix bugs, and release versions with new features. You can also "
"convince or pay others to do these things for you. You are also free to give "
"away and free to sell copies, under the terms of the applicable free "

"\"pirate\", and users have been threatened with imprisonment for "
