<h2>Free Software for Windows</h2>

  <p>Here is a list of popular free software applications that run on
  Microsoft Windows &mdash; along with the proprietary applications
  they replace. If you are still a Windows user, you can take a first
  step towards free software by installing these applications.</p>

<blockquote id="windows7sins" class="imgright">
<p><a href="http://www.upgradefromwindows8.com"><img

alt="Close Windows, Open Doors" /></a></p>
<p>Upgrade from Windows 8</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>When we say these application programs are <a
  href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, we're talking about
  freedom, not price. It means that you are free to use these programs
  constructively, either alone or in a community, while respecting the
  freedom of others. The source code is available, so that you can
  study the software, adapt it to your needs, fix bugs, and release
  versions with new features. You can also convince or pay others to
  do these things for you. You are also free to give away and free to
  sell copies, under the terms of the applicable free software
  license. These programs are free software because <em>you have
  freedom</em> in using them. Free software develops under the control
  of its users.</p>

  <p>Microsoft Windows is a clear and instructive example of nonfree
  software. Its source code is a secret, so programmers cannot learn
  from it, fix it, adapt it to their clients (your) needs, or even
  verify what it really does. If you share copies with your neighbors,
  you will be called a &ldquo;pirate&rdquo;, and users have been threatened with
  imprisonment for this. Nonfree software is completely controlled by
  its developer, who also has power over the users. We started the
  free software movement because <a
  href="/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html">this power is
  unjust</a>.</p>

  <p>Using free software on Microsoft Windows (or any nonfree
  operating system) is the first step towards freedom, but it does not
  get you all the way there. You're still under Microsoft's power as
  long as you use Windows.</p>

  <p>So the next step is to replace Windows with a <a
  href="/distros/">free operating system such as GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>However, on this page we're concerned with the first step.</strong></p>

<dt id="Dia"><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/dia.html">Dia</a></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Dia is designed to be much like the proprietary
  Microsoft program 'Visio'. It can be used to draw many
  different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special
  objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML
  diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple
  circuits. It is also possible to add support for new
  shapes by writing simple XML files, using a subset of SVG
  to draw the shape.</p>

  <p>It can load and save diagrams to a custom XML format
  (gzipped by default, to save space), can export diagrams
  to EPS or SVG formats and can print diagrams (including
  ones that span multiple pages).</p>
</dd>


<dt id="GIMP"><a href="http://directory.fsf.org/gimp.html">GIMP</a></dt>
<dd>
  <p>GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program.
  It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert
  quality photo retouching program, an online batch
  processing system, a mass production image renderer, an
  image format converter, etc.</p>

  <p>GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to
  be augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just
  about anything.</p>

  <p><i>Anyone who is familiar with the GNU/Linux operating
  system has probably seen/used the GIMP at some stage. In
  terms of compatibility, GIMP can open/manipulate the
  PhotoShop <b>PSD</b> format and the Paint Shop Pro
  <b>PSP</b> format.</i></p>
</dd>


<dt id="Inkscape"><a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Inkscape is an vector graphics editor, with
  capabilities similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw,
  or Xara Xtreme using the W3C standard Scalable Vector
  Graphics (SVG) file format. Supported SVG features
  include shapes, paths, text, markers, clones, alpha
  blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and
  grouping.</p>

  <p>Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data,
  node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap
  tracing, text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing,
  and more. It imports formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and
  others and exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based
  formats.</p>

  networking that does not use any centralized or otherwise
  trusted services. A first service implemented on top of
  the networking layer allows anonymous
  censorship-resistant file-sharing. GNUnet uses a simple,
  excess-based economic model to allocate resources. Peers
  in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with respect to
  resource usage; peers that contribute to the network are
  rewarded with better service.</p>
