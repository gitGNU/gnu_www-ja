<h2>Tips for new GNU maintainers</h2>

<p>If you are new to maintaining a GNU package, whether one that you
have offered to GNU or an existing one that you have adopted, it can be
overwhelming to know where to start.  The official email notice you
received when you became a GNU maintainer has lots of details; this
document is not a replacement for that email, but rather a complement,
aiming to provide some tips on getting started.</p>

<p>Of course, what's listed here just skims the surface of GNU
maintainership.  Please be sure to read the <a
href="/prep/maintain/">GNU Maintainers Guide</a> and the <a
href="/prep/standards/">GNU Coding Standards</a>.  Indeed, you should
have read them already, but they are densely enough written that careful
re-readings are useful.  In addition, a few experienced GNU contributors
have volunteered to answer questions about GNU maintenance via
mentors@gnu.org as well as maintainers@gnu.org.</p>

<h3>First steps for new maintainers</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Update project information on Savannah.</b>  Check under "Update
Public Info" in the "Main" menu.  Here, you should set the project's
full name and, if needed, write both a short and a long description for
it (please also send those descriptions to maintainers@gnu.org for use
in the lists of <a href="/software/software.html#allgnupkgs">all GNU
packages</a>).  You should also set its development status to reflect
the maturity of the code.  It is essential to do this if you have
adopted a package, since it will be marked as "Orphan".  (<a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Old-Versions.html">About
Savannah.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Turn to the mailing lists.</b>  If you have a new GNU
package, you should set up at least one mailing list for the package via
Savannah.  It is strongly recommended to have one called
<i>bug-PROJECT@gnu.org</i>; others can wait until traffic warrants.  If
you have adopted an existing package, send an email introducing
yourself.  Finally, whether lists are newly created or already existing,
don't forget to subscribe yourself, as this is not automatically done.
(<a href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Mail.html">About dealing with
mail.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Check for existing bug reports.</b>  If you have adopted an
existing package, be sure to look for existing bug reports.  These may
be on any or all of a Savannah bug tracker, a mailing list (mbox
archives are available via <a href="ftp://lists.gnu.org/">ftp</a> and <a
href="rsync://lists.gnu.org/mbox/">rsync</a>), or at the <a
href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/">GNU debbugs server</a>.  (<a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Replying-to-Mail.html">About replying to
bug reports.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Contact distro packagers.</b>  If you have adopted
an existing package and it is available in downstream distros, get in
contact with the packagers.  It is likely that they have unresolved bug
reports to be addressed, and perhaps even patches that should be
applied.  You may also like to get involved with the <a
href="/software/guix/guix.html">GNU Guix</a> package manager.  (<a
href="/distros/distros.html">About distros.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Use the software.</b>  It should go without saying that if you
have adopted a GNU package, you should use it to get a feel for its
current status and to discover what might need to be fixed.</li>

<li><b>Pick some tasks and start hacking!</b>  There's no substitute for
spending time doing the actual work.</li>

</ul>

<h3>General tips on maintaining GNU software</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Aim for a quick first release.</b>  Whether your package is
new or you've adopted an older one, your number one priority should be
making a first release as soon as possible.  If you've adopted a
package, it's sufficient to fix a few bugs and push that out.  In fact,
just updating the infrastructure files (e.g., Autoconf/Automake, gnulib
modules, etc.) is enough to justify a new release when you've first
taken over a package.  If your package is new, don't be afraid to put
out an early version that is not yet feature complete.  In any case, a
release (with <a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Announcements.html">proper
announcements</a>) will draw attention to your package in the form of
potential users or even other developers.  It is the best way to let
people know that an old package has been revived or that a new package
exists at all.  (<a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Distributions.html">About making
releases.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Focus on fixing outstanding bugs first.</b>  An excellent way to
begin to learn a new codebase is to fix some outstanding bugs to get a
feel for how the system works.  Besides, new features shouldn't be given
much focus if notable problems already exist.  (<a
href="/software/devel.html">About resources for GNU
developers.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Don't try to rewrite the entire thing.</b>  If you've adopted
a package, we strongly recommend that you not set out to rewrite the
whole program from scratch.  While always tempting, and an easy thing to
start, completing it successfully requires a colossal effort, and
experience has shown that it is an almost sure-fire way to become
demotivated and lead to eventual (re-)stagnation of the project.
Instead, focus on incremental improvements.  Once you've become
intimately familiar with the package, you will be in a better position
to consider more radical changes.</li>

<li><b>You're in charge!</b>  As a maintainer, you look after a
package as part of the overall GNU project.  GNU depends on you to take
care of <a href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Legal-Matters.html">legal
matters</a>, make new releases, keep the <a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Web-Pages.html">web pages</a> updated,
reply to bug reports and otherwise communicate with users, <a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Clean-Ups.html">handle patches
appropriately</a>, and all else.  This is your privilege and your
responsibility.  Please help us maintain an active and stable collection
of software.  If you have questions or run into problems, do not
hesitate to get in touch via maintainers@gnu.org.  (<a
href="/prep/maintain/html_node/Recruiting-Developers.html">About
recruiting developers.</a>)</li>

<li><b>Get involved.</b>  GNU consists entirely of volunteers and
your participation in the organization is what you make of it!  As a
maintainer, the communication received from us (read: pestering) will be
low-volume.  Being active within GNU is a great way to increase your
contact and exposure to other like-minded volunteers.  If you find an
aspect of GNU in which you would like to be involved, there is almost
certainly room for contribution.  (<a href="/help/help.html">About
helping GNU and free software.</a>)</li>

<p>To conclude this list with one final reiteration: the information and
links above are just a sampling.  Please refer to and (re)read the full
<a href="/prep/maintain/">GNU Maintainer Information</a> and <a
href="/prep/standards/">GNU Coding Standards</a> documents for plenty
more.</p>
