"We developed these criteria to judge services for hosting parts of the GNU "
"operating system, but we recommend them to everyone that wants to use a "
"service for publicly hosting free source code (and optionally executable "
"programs too). The criteria emphasize protection of privacy, functionality "
"without <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/freejs\">nonfree "
"JavaScript</a>, compatibility with copyleft licensing and philosophy, and "
"not rejecting any users."

"Using JavaScript code to interpret some other language counts as using the "
"JavaScript platform.  Translating another language into JavaScript code and "
"sending that JavaScript code also constitutes use of the JavaScript "
"platform. In the former case, free JavaScript-platform code means that the "
"interpreter and the programs it interprets are free software. In the latter "
"case, free JavaScript-platform code means that the code people maintain, "
"which is input to the translator, is free software; we also require that a "
"free translator exist which is adequate for the translation job.  "
