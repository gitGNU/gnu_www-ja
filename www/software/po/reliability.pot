"Barton P. Miller and his colleagues tested the reliability of Unix utility "
"programs in 1990 and 1995.  Each time, GNU's utilities came out considerably "
"ahead. They tested seven commercial Unix systems as well as GNU.  By "
"subjecting them to a random input stream, they could &ldquo;crash (with core "
"dump) or hang (infinite loop) over 40% (in the worst case) of the basic "
"utility programs&hellip;&rdquo;"

#. type: Content of: <p>

"These researchers found that the commercial Unix systems had a failure rate "
"that ranged from 15% to 43%. In contrast, the failure rate for GNU was only "
"7%."

"Miller also said that, &ldquo;the three commercial systems that we compared "
"in both 1990 and 1995 noticeably improved in reliability, but still had "
"significant rates of failure (the basic utilities from GNU/Linux still were "
"noticeably better than those of the commercial systems).&rdquo;"

"It is no fluke that the GNU utilities are so reliable. There are good "
"reasons why free software tends to be of high quality."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"One reason is that free software gets the whole community involved in "
"working together to fix problems. Users not only report bugs, they even fix "
"bugs and send in fixes. Users work together, conversing by email, to get to "
"the bottom of a problem and make the software work trouble-free."

#. type: Content of: <p>

"Another is that developers really care about reliability.  Free software "
"packages do not always compete commercially, but they still compete for a "
"good reputation, and a program which is unsatisfactory will not achieve the "
"popularity that developers hope for.  What's more, an author who makes the "
"source code available for all to see puts his reputation on the line, and "
"had better make the software clean and clear, on pain of the community's "
"disapproval."
