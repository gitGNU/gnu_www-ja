<P>
<CODE>bc</CODE> [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [ <VAR> file ...</VAR> ]


<P>
<CODE>bc</CODE> is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers
with interactive execution of statements.  There are some similarities
in the syntax to the C programming language. 
A standard math library is available by command line option.
If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files.
<CODE>bc</CODE> starts by processing code from all the files listed
on the command line in the order listed.  After all files have been
processed, <CODE>bc</CODE> reads from the standard input.  All code is
executed as it is read.  (If a file contains a command to halt the
processor, <CODE>bc</CODE> will never read from the standard input.)


<P>
This version of <CODE>bc</CODE> contains several extensions beyond
traditional <CODE>bc</CODE> implementations and the POSIX draft standard.
Command line options can cause these extensions to print a warning or to
be rejected.  This document describes the language accepted by this
processor.  Extensions will be identified as such.


<P>
The author would like to thank Steve Sommars
(<A HREF="mailto:Steve.Sommars@att.com">Steve.Sommars@att.com</A>) for his extensive help in testing the
implementation.  Many great suggestions were given.  This is a much
better product due to his involvement.


<P>
Email bug reports to <A HREF="mailto:bug-bc@gnu.org">bug-bc@gnu.org</A>.  Be sure to include
the word "bc" somewhere in the "Subject:" field.
