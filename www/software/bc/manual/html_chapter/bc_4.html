<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC15">Statements</A></H1>

<P>
Statements (as in most algebraic languages) provide the sequencing of
expression evaluation.  In <CODE>bc</CODE> statements are executed "as soon
as possible."  Execution happens when a newline in encountered and there
is one or more complete statements.  Due to this immediate execution,
newlines are very important in <CODE>bc</CODE>. In fact, both a semicolon
and a newline are used as statement separators.  An improperly placed
newline will cause a syntax error.  Because newlines are statement
separators, it is possible to hide a newline by using the backslash
character.  The sequence "\&#60;nl&#62;", where &#60;nl&#62; is the newline appears to
<CODE>bc</CODE> as whitespace instead of a newline.  A statement list is a
series of statements separated by semicolons and newlines.  The
following is a list of <CODE>bc</CODE> statements and what they do: (Things
enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) are optional parts of the statement.)


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>expression</VAR>
<DD>
This statement does one of two things.  If the expression starts with
"&#60;variable&#62; &#60;assignment&#62; ...", it is considered to be an assignment
statement.  If the expression is not an assignment statement, the
expression is evaluated and printed to the output.  After the number is
printed, a newline is printed.  For example, "a=1" is an assignment
statement and "(a=1)" is an expression that has an embedded assignment.
All numbers that are printed are printed in the base specified by the
variable <VAR>obase</VAR>. The legal values for <VAR>obase</VAR> are 2 through
BC_BASE_MAX (see section <A HREF="bc_10.html#SEC23">Environment Variables</A>).  For bases 2 through 16,
the usual method of writing numbers is used.  For bases greater than 16,
<CODE>bc</CODE> uses a multi-character digit method of printing the numbers
where each higher base digit is printed as a base 10 number.  The
multi-character digits are separated by spaces.  Each digit contains the
number of characters required to represent the base ten value of
"<VAR>obase</VAR> -1".  Since numbers are of arbitrary precision, some
numbers may not be printable on a single output line.  These long
numbers will be split across lines using the "\" as the last character
on a line.  The maximum number of characters printed per line is 70.
Due to the interactive nature of <CODE>bc</CODE>, printing a number causes
the side effect of assigning the printed value to the special variable
<VAR>last</VAR>. This allows the user to recover the last value printed
without having to retype the expression that printed the number.
Assigning to <VAR>last</VAR> is legal and will overwrite the last printed
value with the assigned value.  The newly assigned value will remain
until the next number is printed or another value is assigned to
<VAR>last</VAR>.  (Some installations may allow the use of a single period
(.) which is not part of a number as a short hand notation for for
<VAR>last</VAR>.)

<DT><VAR>string</VAR>
<DD>
The string is printed to the output.  Strings start with a double quote
character and contain all characters until the next double quote character.
All characters are taken literally, including any newline.  No newline
character is printed after the string.

<DT><VAR><CODE>print</CODE> <VAR>list</VAR></VAR>
<DD>
The <CODE>print</CODE> statement (an extension) provides another method of
output.  The <VAR>list</VAR> is a list of strings and expressions separated by
commas.  Each string or expression is printed in the order of the list.
No terminating newline is printed.  Expressions are evaluated and their
value is printed and assigned to the variable <CODE>last</CODE>. Strings in
the print statement are printed to the output and may contain special
characters.  Special characters start with the backslash character (\e).
The special characters recognized by <CODE>bc</CODE> are "a" (alert or
bell), "b" (backspace), "f" (form feed), "n" (newline), "r" (carriage
return), "q" (double quote), "t" (tab), and "\e" (backslash).  Any other
character following the backslash will be ignored.

<DT><VAR>{ statement_list }</VAR>
<DD>
This is the compound statement.  It allows multiple statements to be
grouped together for execution.

<DT><VAR><CODE>if</CODE> ( expression ) statement1 [<CODE>else</CODE> statement2]</VAR>
<DD>
The if statement evaluates the expression and executes statement1 or
statement2 depending on the value of the expression.  If the expression
is non-zero, statement1 is executed.  If statement2 is present and
the value of the expression is 0, then statement2 is executed.  (The
<CODE>else</CODE> clause is an extension.)

<DT><VAR><CODE>while</CODE> ( expression ) statement</VAR>
<DD>
The while statement will execute the statement while the expression
is non-zero.  It evaluates the expression before each execution of
the statement.   Termination of the loop is caused by a zero
expression value or the execution of a <CODE>break</CODE> statement.

<DT><VAR><CODE>for</CODE> ( [expression1] ; [expression2] ; [expression3] ) statement</VAR>
<DD>
The <CODE>for</CODE> statement controls repeated execution of the statement.
<VAR>Expression1</VAR> is evaluated before the loop.  <VAR>Expression2</VAR> is
evaluated before each execution of the statement.  If it is non-zero,
the statement is evaluated.  If it is zero, the loop is terminated.
After each execution of the statement, <VAR>expression3</VAR> is evaluated
before the reevaluation of expression2.  If <VAR>expression1</VAR> or
<VAR>expression3</VAR> are missing, nothing is evaluated at the point they
would be evaluated.  If <VAR>expression2</VAR> is missing, it is the same as
substituting the value 1 for <VAR>expression2</VAR>.  (The optional
expressions are an extension. POSIX <CODE>bc</CODE> requires all three
expressions.)  The following is equivalent code for the <CODE>for</CODE>
statement:


<PRE>
expression1;
while (expression2) {
   statement;
   expression3;
}
</PRE>

<DT><VAR><CODE>break</CODE></VAR>
<DD>
This statement causes a forced exit of the most recent enclosing <CODE>while</CODE>
statement or <CODE>for</CODE> statement.

<DT><VAR><CODE>continue</CODE></VAR>
<DD>
The <CODE>continue</CODE> statement (an extension)  causes the most recent enclosing
<CODE>for</CODE> statement to start the next iteration.

<DT><VAR><CODE>halt</CODE></VAR>
<DD>
The <CODE>halt</CODE> statement (an extension) is an executed statement that
causes the <CODE>bc</CODE> processor to quit only when it is executed.  For
example, "if (0 == 1) halt" will not cause <CODE>bc</CODE> to terminate
because the <CODE>halt</CODE> is not executed.

<DT><VAR><CODE>return</CODE></VAR>
<DD>
Return the value 0 from a function.  (See section <A HREF="bc_5.html#SEC17">Functions</A>.)

<DT><VAR><CODE>return</CODE> ( expression )</VAR>
<DD>
Return the value of the expression from a function.  (See section <A HREF="bc_5.html#SEC17">Functions</A>.)
As an extension, the parenthesis are not required.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC16">Pseudo Statements</A></H2>

<P>
These statements are not statements in the traditional sense.  They are
not executed statements.  Their function is performed at "compile" time.


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>limits</CODE>
<DD>
Print the local limits enforced by the local version of <CODE>bc</CODE>.  This
is an extension.

<DT><CODE>quit</CODE>
<DD>
When the <CODE>quit</CODE> statement is read, the <CODE>bc</CODE> processor
is terminated, regardless of where the <CODE>quit</CODE> statement is found.  For
example, "if (0 == 1) quit" will cause <CODE>bc</CODE> to terminate.

<DT><CODE>warranty</CODE>
<DD>
Print a longer warranty notice.  This is an extension.
