<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC9">About Expressions and Special Variables</A></H2>

<P>
The numbers are manipulated by expressions and statements.  Since
the language was designed to be interactive, statements and expressions
are executed as soon as possible.  There is no main program.  Instead,
code is executed as it is encountered.  (Functions, discussed in
detail later, are defined when encountered.)


<P>
A simple expression is just a constant. <CODE>bc</CODE> converts constants
into internal decimal numbers using the current input base, specified by
the variable <VAR>ibase</VAR>. (There is an exception in functions.)  The
legal values of <VAR>ibase</VAR> are 2 through 16.  Assigning a value outside
this range to <VAR>ibase</VAR> will result in a value of 2 or 16.  Input
numbers may contain the characters 0-9 and A-F. (Note: They must be
capitals.  Lower case letters are variable names.)  Single digit numbers
always have the value of the digit regardless of the value of
<VAR>ibase</VAR>. (i.e. A = 10.)  For multi-digit numbers, <CODE>bc</CODE>
changes all input digits greater or equal to <VAR>ibase</VAR> to the value of
<VAR>ibase</VAR>-1.  This makes the number <CODE>FFF</CODE> always be the largest
3 digit number of the input base.


<P>
Full expressions are similar to many other high level languages.
Since there is only one kind of number, there are no rules for mixing
types.  Instead, there are rules on the scale of expressions.  Every
expression has a scale.  This is derived from the scale of original
numbers, the operation performed and in many cases, the value of the
variable <VAR>scale</VAR>. Legal values of the variable <VAR>scale</VAR> are
0 to the maximum number representable by a C integer.




<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC10">Basic Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
In the following descriptions of legal expressions, "expr" refers to a
complete expression and "<VAR>var</VAR>" refers to a simple or an array variable.
A simple variable is just a 


<P>
<VAR>name</VAR>


<P>
and an array variable is specified as 


<P>
<VAR>name</VAR>[<VAR>expr</VAR>] 


<P>
Unless specifically mentioned the scale of the result is the maximum
scale of the expressions involved.


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>- expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result is the negation of the expression.

<DT><CODE>++ <VAR>var</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The variable is incremented by one and the new value is the result of
the expression.

<DT><CODE>-- <VAR>var</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The variable
is decremented by one and the new value is the result of the
expression.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> ++</CODE>
<DD>
 The result of the expression is the value of
the variable and then the variable is incremented by one.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> --</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the value of the variable and then
the variable is decremented by one.

<DT><CODE>expr + expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the sum of the two expressions.

<DT><CODE>expr - expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the difference of the two expressions.

<DT><CODE>expr * expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the product of the two expressions.

<DT><CODE>expr / expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the quotient of the two expressions.
The scale of the result is the value of the variable <CODE>scale</CODE>

<DT><CODE>expr % expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the "remainder" and it is computed in the
following way.  To compute a%b, first a/b is computed to <VAR>scale</VAR>
digits.  That result is used to compute a-(a/b)*b to the scale of the
maximum of <VAR>scale</VAR>+scale(b) and scale(a).  If <VAR>scale</VAR> is set
to zero and both expressions are integers this expression is the
integer remainder function.

<DT><CODE>expr ^ expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the value of the first raised to the
second. The second expression must be an integer.  (If the second
expression is not an integer, a warning is generated and the
expression is truncated to get an integer value.)  The scale of the
result is <VAR>scale</VAR> if the exponent is negative.  If the exponent
is positive the scale of the result is the minimum of the scale of the
first expression times the value of the exponent and the maximum of
<VAR>scale</VAR> and the scale of the first expression.  (e.g. scale(a^b)
= min(scale(a)*b, max(<VAR>scale</VAR>, scale(a))).)  It should be noted
that expr^0 will always return the value of 1.

<DT><CODE>( expr )</CODE>
<DD>
This alters the standard precedence to force the evaluation of the
expression.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> = expr</CODE>
<DD>
The variable is assigned the value of the expression.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> &#60;op&#62;= expr</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to "<VAR>var</VAR> = <VAR>var</VAR> &#60;op&#62; expr" with the
exception that the "<VAR>var</VAR>" part is evaluated only once.  This can
make a difference if "<VAR>var</VAR>" is an array.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC11">Relational Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
Relational expressions are a special kind of expression that always
evaluate to 0 or 1, 0 if the relation is false and 1 if the relation is
true.  These may appear in any legal expression.  (POSIX <CODE>bc</CODE>
requires that relational expressions are used only in <CODE>if</CODE>,
<CODE>while</CODE>, and <CODE>for</CODE> statements and that only one relational
test may be done in them.)  The relational operators are


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>expr1 &#60; expr2</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly less than expr2.

<DT><CODE>expr1 &#60;= expr2</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr1 is less than or equal to expr2.

<DT><CODE>expr1 &#62; expr2</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly greater than expr2.

<DT><CODE>expr1 &#62;= expr2</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr1 is greater than or equal to expr2.

<DT><CODE>expr1 == expr2</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr1 is equal to expr2.

<DT><CODE>expr1 != expr2</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr1 is not equal to expr2.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC12">Boolean Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
Boolean operations are also legal.  (POSIX <CODE>bc</CODE> does NOT have
boolean operations). The result of all boolean operations are 0 and 1
(for false and true) as in relational expressions.  The boolean
operators are:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>!expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if expr is 0.

<DT><CODE>expr &#38;&#38; expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if both expressions are non-zero.

<DT><CODE>expr || expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result is 1 if either expression is non-zero.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC13">Precedence</A></H2>

<P>
The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to highest)



<PRE>
|| operator, left associative
&#38;&#38; operator, left associative
! operator, nonassociative
Relational operators, left associative
Assignment operator, right associative
+ and - operators, left associative
*, / and % operators, left associative
^ operator, right associative
unary - operator, nonassociative
++ and -- operators, nonassociative
</PRE>

<P>
This precedence was chosen so that POSIX compliant <CODE>bc</CODE> programs
will run correctly. This will cause the use of the relational and
logical operators to have some unusual behavior when used with
assignment expressions.  Consider the expression:



<PRE>
a = 3 &#60; 5
</PRE>

<P>
Most C programmers would assume this would assign the result of "3 &#60;
5" (the value 1) to the variable "a".  What this does in <CODE>bc</CODE> is
assign the value 3 to the variable "a" and then compare 3 to 5.  It is
best to use parentheses when using relational and logical operators
with the assignment operators.




<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC14">Special Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
There are a few more special expressions that are provided in
<CODE>bc</CODE>.  These have to do with user-defined functions and standard
functions.  They all appear as
"<VAR>name</VAR><CODE>(</CODE><VAR>parameters</VAR><CODE>)</CODE>".  See section <A HREF="bc_5.html#SEC17">Functions</A>, for
user-defined functions.  The standard functions are:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>length ( expression )</CODE>
<DD>
The value of the length function is the number of significant digits in the
expression.

<DT><CODE>read ( )</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>read</CODE> function (an extension) will read a number from the
standard input, regardless of where the function occurs.  Beware, this
can cause problems with the mixing of data and program in the standard
input.  The best use for this function is in a previously written
program that needs input from the user, but never allows program code to
be input from the user.  The value of the <CODE>read</CODE> function is the
number read from the standard input using the current value of the
variable <VAR>ibase</VAR> for the conversion base.

<DT><CODE>scale ( expression )</CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>scale</CODE> function is the number of digits after the
decimal point in the expression.

<DT><CODE>sqrt ( expression )</CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>sqrt</CODE> function is the square root of the
expression.  If the expression is negative, a run time error is
generated.
