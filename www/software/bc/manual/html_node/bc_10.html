<P>
In the following descriptions of legal expressions, "expr" refers to a
complete expression and "<VAR>var</VAR>" refers to a simple or an array variable.
A simple variable is just a 


<P>
<VAR>name</VAR>


<P>
and an array variable is specified as 


<P>
<VAR>name</VAR>[<VAR>expr</VAR>] 


<P>
Unless specifically mentioned the scale of the result is the maximum
scale of the expressions involved.


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>- expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result is the negation of the expression.

<DT><CODE>++ <VAR>var</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The variable is incremented by one and the new value is the result of
the expression.

<DT><CODE>-- <VAR>var</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The variable
is decremented by one and the new value is the result of the
expression.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> ++</CODE>
<DD>
 The result of the expression is the value of
the variable and then the variable is incremented by one.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> --</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the value of the variable and then
the variable is decremented by one.

<DT><CODE>expr + expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the sum of the two expressions.

<DT><CODE>expr - expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the difference of the two expressions.

<DT><CODE>expr * expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the product of the two expressions.

<DT><CODE>expr / expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the quotient of the two expressions.
The scale of the result is the value of the variable <CODE>scale</CODE>

<DT><CODE>expr % expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the "remainder" and it is computed in the
following way.  To compute a%b, first a/b is computed to <VAR>scale</VAR>
digits.  That result is used to compute a-(a/b)*b to the scale of the
maximum of <VAR>scale</VAR>+scale(b) and scale(a).  If <VAR>scale</VAR> is set
to zero and both expressions are integers this expression is the
integer remainder function.

<DT><CODE>expr ^ expr</CODE>
<DD>
The result of the expression is the value of the first raised to the
second. The second expression must be an integer.  (If the second
expression is not an integer, a warning is generated and the
expression is truncated to get an integer value.)  The scale of the
result is <VAR>scale</VAR> if the exponent is negative.  If the exponent
is positive the scale of the result is the minimum of the scale of the
first expression times the value of the exponent and the maximum of
<VAR>scale</VAR> and the scale of the first expression.  (e.g. scale(a^b)
= min(scale(a)*b, max(<VAR>scale</VAR>, scale(a))).)  It should be noted
that expr^0 will always return the value of 1.

<DT><CODE>( expr )</CODE>
<DD>
This alters the standard precedence to force the evaluation of the
expression.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> = expr</CODE>
<DD>
The variable is assigned the value of the expression.

<DT><CODE><VAR>var</VAR> &#60;op&#62;= expr</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to "<VAR>var</VAR> = <VAR>var</VAR> &#60;op&#62; expr" with the
exception that the "<VAR>var</VAR>" part is evaluated only once.  This can
make a difference if "<VAR>var</VAR>" is an array.
