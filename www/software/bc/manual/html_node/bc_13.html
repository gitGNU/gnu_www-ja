<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="bc_toc.html#TOC13">Precedence</A></H2>

<P>
The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to highest)



<PRE>
|| operator, left associative
&#38;&#38; operator, left associative
! operator, nonassociative
Relational operators, left associative
Assignment operator, right associative
+ and - operators, left associative
*, / and % operators, left associative
^ operator, right associative
unary - operator, nonassociative
++ and -- operators, nonassociative
</PRE>

<P>
This precedence was chosen so that POSIX compliant <CODE>bc</CODE> programs
will run correctly. This will cause the use of the relational and
logical operators to have some unusual behavior when used with
assignment expressions.  Consider the expression:



<PRE>
a = 3 &#60; 5
</PRE>

<P>
Most C programmers would assume this would assign the result of "3 &#60;
5" (the value 1) to the variable "a".  What this does in <CODE>bc</CODE> is
assign the value 3 to the variable "a" and then compare 3 to 5.  It is
best to use parentheses when using relational and logical operators
with the assignment operators.
