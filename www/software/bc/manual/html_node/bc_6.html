<P>
Numbers are stored in two types of variables, simple variables and
arrays.  Both simple variables and array variables are named.  Names
begin with a letter followed by any number of letters, digits and
underscores.  All letters must be lower case.  (Full alphanumeric
names are an extension. In POSIX <CODE>bc</CODE> all names are a single
lower case letter.)  The type of variable is clear by the context
because all array variable names will be followed by brackets ( [ ] ).


<P>
There are four special variables, <VAR>scale</VAR>, <VAR>ibase</VAR>, <VAR>obase</VAR>, and
<VAR>last</VAR>.  <VAR>scale</VAR> defines how some operations use digits after the
decimal point.  The default value of <VAR>scale</VAR> is 0. <VAR>ibase</VAR>
and <VAR>obase</VAR> define the conversion base for input and output
numbers.  The default for both input and output is base 10.
<VAR>last</VAR> (an extension) is a variable that has the value of the last
printed number.  These will be discussed in further detail where
appropriate.  All of these variables may have values assigned to them
as well as used in expressions.
