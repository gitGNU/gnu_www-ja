<P>
Comments in <CODE>bc</CODE> start with the characters <CODE>/*</CODE> and end with
the characters <CODE>*/</CODE>.  Comments may start anywhere and appear as a
single space in the input.  (This causes comments to delimit other
input items.  For example, a comment can not be found in the middle of
a variable name.)  Comments include any newlines (end of line) between
the start and the end of the comment.


<P>
To support the use of scripts for <CODE>bc</CODE>, a single line comment has been
added as an extension.  A single line comment starts at a <CODE>#</CODE>
character and continues to the next end of the line.  The end of line
character is not part of the comment and is processed normally.
