<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`!'</SAMP>
<DD>
Will run the rest of the line as a system command.
Note that parsing of the !&#60;, !=, and !&#62; commands take precidence,
so if you want to run a command starting with &#60;, =, or &#62; you will
need to add a space after the !.

<DT><SAMP>`#'</SAMP>
<DD>
Will interpret the rest of the line as a comment.
(This command is a GNU extension.)

<DT><SAMP>`:<VAR>r</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Will pop the top two values off of the stack.
The old second-to-top value will be stored in the array <VAR>r</VAR>,
indexed by the old top-of-stack value.

<DT><SAMP>`;<VAR>r</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Pops the top-of-stack and uses it as an index into
the array <VAR>r</VAR>.
The selected value is then pushed onto the stack.
</DL>

<P>
Note that each stacked instance of a register has its own
array associated with it.
Thus <SAMP>`1 <VAR>0:a</VAR> 0S<VAR>a</VAR> 2 <VAR>0:a</VAR> L<VAR>a</VAR> <VAR>0;a</VAR>p'</SAMP>
will print 1, because the 2 was stored in an instance of <VAR>0:a</VAR>
that was later popped.
