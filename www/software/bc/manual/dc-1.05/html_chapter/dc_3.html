<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`p'</SAMP>
<DD>
Prints the value on the top of the stack,
without altering the stack.
A newline is printed after the value.

<DT><SAMP>`n'</SAMP>
<DD>
Prints the value on the top of the stack, popping it off,
and does not print a newline after.
(This command is a GNU extension.)

<DT><SAMP>`P'</SAMP>
<DD>
Pops off the value on top of the stack.
If it it a string, it is simply printed without a trailing newline.
Otherwise it is a number, and the integer portion of its absolute
value is printed out as a "base (UCHAR_MAX+1)" byte stream.
Assuming that (UCHAR_MAX+1) is 256
(as it is on most machines with 8-bit bytes),
the sequence
<CODE>KSK 0k1/ [_1*]sx d0&#62;x [256~aPd0&#60;x]dsxx sxLKk</CODE>
could also accomplish this function,
except for the side-effect of clobbering the x register.
(Details of the behavior with a number are a GNU extension.)

<DT><SAMP>`f'</SAMP>
<DD>
Prints the entire contents of the stack
without altering anything.
This is a good command to use if you are lost or want
to figure out what the effect of some command has been.
