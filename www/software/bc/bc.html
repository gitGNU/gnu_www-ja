<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,
     with the SSI statements intact, from
     http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/boilerplate.html?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
-->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain

<h2>bc</h2>

<p>bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language.  Syntax is
similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas.  It supports
interactive execution of statements.  bc is a utility included in the
POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.</p>
<P>
Since the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented,
this version does not use the historical method of having bc be a
compiler for the dc calculator.  This version has a single executable
that both compiles the language and runs the resulting `byte code'.
The byte code is <EM>not</EM> the dc language.

<P>
