<p>gnuskies has been decommissioned as a GNU package.  We suggest 
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Celestia">celestia</a>.

<P>
The GnuSkies Project is an attempt to
create  a 'Total Plug In' (TPI) application which will eventually
contain many features not yet implemented in xephem.

Listed below are some of the
crude initial modules that are currently under development. Please note
that these will likely be updated and can considerably change in the near
future. Please feel free to contribute your ideas about any of these:

<P>

<UL>

  <LI>
       <B>Total Plug In (TPI) base</B> - Bill (aka Crash) is developing the TPI
       core which will allow the rest of the application to be developed as
       plugins.

  <LI>
       <B>SQL database server (plugin)</B> - with star catalogs, orbital
       elements for the trajectories of well known objects, and so on...
       We will most likely use the PostgreSQL server for this since that
       is available under GPL. Mark (our SQL guru) has volunteered to do
       this part, and Chip already has some rudimentary code written.

  <LI>
       <B>Planetarium-like display facility (plugin)</B> - so that objects in
       the sky can graphically displayed on a computer screen in so that it
       looks just like the night sky on any given day at any given time. Chip
       is leading the development on this part of the project.

  <LI>
       <B>Ephemeris backend</B> - covering the most basic functionality.
       Darren already has some code in place for this section.

  <LI>
       <B>Orbital computation/estimation module</B> - Darren and Rahul will be
       working on this part of the project.
</UL>

<P>
These modules were chosen because they are relatively fundamental. Please
send in your opinions and feel free to make any additions. We are always
looking for additional volunteers to help us with our development efforts.
In addition to the above areas, we need help with the following:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>
<B>GUI design and development</B>

<LI>
<B>Graphics - icons, bitmaps, etc.</B>

</UL>
