<h2>2002 Free Software Awards</h2>

<p>
The 2002 Free Software Foundation Award Ceremony was held Free and Open
Source Software Developers' Meeting (FOSDEM) in Brussels, Belgium on
Saturday 8 February 2003.  The ceremony was held in collaboration with the
<a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>.
</p>

<p>
FSF President and founder, Richard Stallman, presented the award to
Lawrence Lessig for promoting understanding of the political dimension
of free software, including the idea that &ldquo;code is law&rdquo;.
Lessig has also promoted ideas similar to free software in other
related fields.
</p>

<p>
A committee of Free Software leaders selected the winner and two other
finalists from the nominations received by the public among the
thousands of mostly volunteer programmers worldwide who dedicate their
time to advancing Free Software.  The selection committee included:
Enrique A. Chaparro, Frederic Couchet, Hong Feng, Miguel de Icaza,
Raju Mathur, Frederick Noronha, Jonas Oberg, Eric Raymond, Guido van
Rossum, Peter Salus, Suresh Ramasubramanian, and Larry Wall.
</p>

<p>
Prior to committee deliberations, a four month open nominations
process decided the list from which the committee chose these
finalists.
</p>

<p>
Lessig was chosen from three finalists for the award.  The other finalists
were Bruno Haible (known for his work on GNU CLISP) and Theo de Raadt
(known for his work on OpenBSD).
