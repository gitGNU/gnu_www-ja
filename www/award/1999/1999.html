<h2>1999 Free Software Awards</h2>

<p>
New York, New York &mdash; December 15, 1999 &mdash; The Free Software
Foundation (FSF) bestowed its second Free Software Foundation Award
for the Advancement of Free Software on Miguel de Icaza.  The award, a
one-of-a-kind handmade quilt, was given to the 27-year-old Mexico
native for de Icaza's excellent work on
the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> project.  The ceremony
was held in conjunction with &ldquo;The Bazaar&rdquo;, an EarthWeb
event currently taking place at the Jacob Javits Center in New York
City.</p>

<p>
de Icaza headed a team of more than 300 programmers worldwide, most of
them volunteers, in the development of GNOME.  GNOME is a
user-friendly graphical users interface (GUI) and programming platform
for GNU/Linux.  GNOME 1.0 was first released in March, 1999 and has
since had a step-up release.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miguel's efforts have done a great deal to bring the free
software model into the mainstream,&rdquo; Peter Salus, chairman of
the Free Software Foundation Awards Committee said.  &ldquo;The GNOME
project enables a new generation of computer users to access the power
of GNU/Linux.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The two other finalists for the award were: Donald Knuth for his TeX
and METAFONT systems which developed a new paradigm for typesetting
and for his technique of &ldquo;literate programming&rdquo; and John
Gilmore for his work with Cygnus Solutions, the first company
dedicated to supporting free software, as well as for his continued
championship of the Free Software movement.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We began the Free Software Foundation Award as a way to honor
those who have tirelessly given their time and their immense talent to
further the free software movement,&rdquo; Richard Stallman, founder
and president of the Free Software Foundation said.  &ldquo;We felt
that Miguel's continued work on the GNOME project deserved the
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
de Icaza continues the effort to make GNOME a competitive user's
interface, developing programs like Bonobo, a compound document model
system that enables all programs using the GNOME format to work
together seamlessly.  He and partner Nat Friedman have founded Helix
Code, a company dedicated to taking GNOME to the next level by
providing viable, commercial-grade software based on the free software
model.</p>
