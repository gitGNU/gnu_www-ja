<h3 style="text-align: center;">The First Annual Free Software
Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">MIT Media Lab<br />
Friday, October 9, 1998</h4>

<h4>Finalists</h4>

<p>The Apache Project is a collaborative software development effort
aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and
freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web)
server.</p>

<blockquote><p>Apache has demonstrated that free software can be the
best available in open (market) competition, measured by commercial
standards of quality, and that an open, distributed development
process can produce such software.  While there are many other pieces
of commercial-quality free software available, I believe Apache is
unique in both being clearly preferred to its commercial competitors
<em>and</em> having been developed in a relatively decentralized
manner.</p></blockquote>

<p>Donald J. Becker was nominated for network device drivers for
GNU/Linux, and for the Beowulf project.</p>

<p>He is a Staff Scientist with the Center of Excellence in Space Data
and Information Sciences.  CESDIS is part of the University Space
Research Association, a non-profit consortium of universities that
funds space-related university research and runs research groups such
as RIACS and ICASE.  He is also the principal investigator on the
Beowulf Project, an effort to develop a software distribution to help
others build high-performance workstations based on a cluster of
off-the-shelf processing nodes running GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an internet-based
hypermedia initiative for global information sharing.  He directs the
World Wide Web (W3) Consortium, an open forum of companies and
organizations with the mission to realize the full potential of the
Web.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the course of history, Hypertext and the concept of
a universal document and linking system has been invented dozens of
times.  Tim's unique contribution was enabled by, and indisputably
demonstrated, the inexorable power of free software.  Upon this
infrastructure, the World Wide Web came into being, and more than
anything else, changed the world's perception of the intrinsic value
of free software.</p></blockquote>

<p>L. Peter Deutsch was nominated for Ghostscript, an interpreter for
the PostScript (TM) language.  A PostScript interpreter usually takes
as input a set of graphics commands.  The output is usually a page
bitmap which is then sent to an output device such as a printer or
display.  PostScript is embedded in many printers.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ghostscript is the base of virtually all GNU/Linux (and
possibly other free OS) printing systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jordan Hubbard was one of the founders of the FreeBSD Project and
is its public relations officer and release engineer, as well as
President and CEO of FreeBSD, Inc.  &ldquo;Number One cat
herder.&rdquo; FreeBSD is an advanced BSD Unix operating system for
&ldquo;PC-compatible&rdquo; computers.</p>

<p>Jordan Hubbard will chair the FREENIX track at USENIX '99 in
Monterey, CA on June 6-11, 1999.</p>


<p>Donald Knuth, one of the acknowledged fathers of computer science,
was nominated for his TeX typesetting system and his technique of
&lsquo;literate programming.&rsquo; &ldquo;His special contribution is
that he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">explained</span> a
large program that does &ldquo;real life&rdquo; work.&rdquo; His books
include <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>, <cite>Literate
Programming</cite>, and <cite>Digital Typography</cite>.  He is
Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming at Stanford
University.</p>

<p>In 1974 Donald Knuth won the Turing Award, the ACM's most
prestigious technical award.  In 1996 he received the Kyoto Prize,
Japan's highest private award for lifetime achievement, the closest
thing to a Nobel Prize in computer science.</p>

<p>Ted Lemon was nominated for his work with the Internet Software
Consortium.  The ISC is a nonprofit corporation for the implementation
of publicly-available code for key portions of the Internet
infrastructure.  Its current programs include widely-used
implementations of the Domain Name System (BIND), Netnews (INN) and
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  Ted Lemon is
Architect and programmer on ISC DHCP, which automates most of the
management of IP addresses on client machines, and he participates
actively in the support list for that product.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ted is excellent at considering the suggestions for
changes in the software and incorporating those which will make the
product more useful, while keeping the code base &ldquo;rock
solid&rdquo; and making sure that everything complies with the
pertinent RFCs.  If more people worked through an idea before
releasing the product the way Ted does, computer software would be
much more reliable and would interact with other software and hardware
more easily.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brian Paul is the author of the Mesa 3D graphics library.  Mesa
uses the OpenGL API (Application Programming Interface).  Most
applications written for OpenGL can use Mesa instead without changing
the source code.  Mesa was originally designed for Unix/X11 systems
and is still best supported on those systems. Others have contributed
drivers for the Amiga, Apple Macintosh, BeOS, NeXT, OS/2, MS-DOS, VMS,
and Windows 95/NT.</p>

<p>Brian Paul now works at Avid Technology in Tewksbury, Mass., but
his work there is not associated with Mesa.  He was formerly employed
at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of
Wisconsin &mdash; Madison.</p>

<p>Eric S. Raymond was nominated for his writings, especially his
essay &ldquo;The Cathedral and the Bazaar.&rdquo; This paper was
described by Netscape Communications, Inc., as a major factor in their
decision to release their client software as &ldquo;open
source&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He is also editor of <cite>The New Hackers' Dictionary</cite>;
principal researcher and author of <cite>Portable C and Unix Systems
Programming</cite>; programmer of &ldquo;C-INTERCAL&rdquo;, an
INTERCAL-to-C compiler; principal co-developer of ncurses, a freeware
screen-handling library with an API compatible with System V
curses(3); co-curator of the Retrocomputing Museum; and Technical
Director of the Chester County Internet Link (CCIL).</p>

<p>He &ldquo;defined what it means to be Open Source&rdquo; and was
&ldquo;single-handedly responsible for Netscape going open
source.&rdquo; &ldquo;His fetchmail program (not to mention that
delightful Intercal to C translator :) ) is a great
goodness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry Spencer is a widely quoted Unix systems programmer who
developed robust and widely used software to handle regular
expressions.</p>

<p>He ran the first Usenet site in Canada, and is well-known as a
Usenet contributor in many areas, notably the space and C groups.  He
and David Lawrence wrote <cite>Managing Usenet</cite>.  He also
wrote <cite>The Ten Commandments For C Programmers</cite>, and the
&ldquo;regular expressions&rdquo; chapter for <cite>Software Solutions
in C</cite>.</p>

<p>He has written various pieces of freely-available software: the
public-domain getopt, the first redistributable string library, the
widely-used redistributable regular-expression library, the 4.4BSD
POSIX regular-expression library, the awf text formatter, etc.  He and
Geoff Collyer wrote C News, one of the two major software packages for
network news transport and storage.</p>

<p>Larry Wall was nominated for his many contributions to the
advancement of freely distributed software, most notably Perl, a
robust scripting language for sophisticated text manipulation and
system management.  His other widely-used programs include rn (news
reader), patch (development and distribution tool), metaconfig (a
program that writes Configure scripts), and the Warp space-war
game.</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; Perl, a tool that takes the Unix ideas of
flexibility and portability further than almost any program before it.
Perl is probably the most powerful and widely applicable GNU
program.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Larry Wall has always promoted keeping his
implementations free for all to study, enhance, and build on, without
restrictions, and the freedom for all to benefit in whatever ways they
can from his products.</p></blockquote>
