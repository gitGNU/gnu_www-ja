"Apache has demonstrated that free software can be the best available in open "
"(market) competition, measured by commercial standards of quality, and that "
"an open, distributed development process can produce such software.  While "
"there are many other pieces of commercial-quality free software available, I "
"believe Apache is unique in both being clearly preferred to its commercial "
"competitors <em>and</em> having been developed in a relatively decentralized "
