<h3>Call for Nominations for the 2003 FSF Award for the Advancement of
Free Software </h3>

<p>
The FSF and the GNU project request nominations for the 2003 FSF Award
for the Advancement of Free Software.  We want to give this award to a
person who has made a great contribution to the progress and
development of Free Software (free as in freedom as defined in
the <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition</a>),
through activities that accord with the spirit of software
freedom.</p>

<p>
Any kind of activity could be eligible &mdash; writing software,
writing documentation, publishing CDs, even journalism &mdash; but
whatever the activity, we want to recognize long-term central
contributions to the development of the world of software freedom.
&ldquo;Accord with the spirit&rdquo; means, for example, that
software, manuals or collections of them (online or on CD) must be
entirely Free.  Work done commercially is eligible, but we give this
award to individuals, not to companies, organizations, or teams.</p>

<p>
People such as Miguel de Icaza, Donald Knuth, Larry Lessig, Brian
Paul, Guido van Rossum, Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and Larry
Wall who have already received this or other awards for their
contributions, are not eligible for the Award for the Advancement of
Free Software.  Among those who are eligible, the award committee will
try to choose whoever has made the greatest contribution.</p>

<p>
Please send your nominations
to <a href="mailto:award-nominations@gnu.org">
&lt;award-nominations@gnu.org&gt;</a>, on or before Friday 31 October
2003.  Please submit nominations in the following format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put the name of the person you are nominating in the email message
subject line.</li>

<li> Please include, in the body of your message, an explanation (40
lines or less) of the work the person has done and why you think it is
especially important to software freedom.</li>

<li>Please state, in the body of your message, where to find the
materials (e.g., software, manuals, or writing) which your nomination
is based on.</li>
</ul>
