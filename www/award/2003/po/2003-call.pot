"The FSF and the GNU project request nominations for the 2003 FSF Award for "
"the Advancement of Free Software.  We want to give this award to a person "
"who has made a great contribution to the progress and development of Free "
"Software (free as in freedom as defined in the <a "
"href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">Free Software Definition</a>), through "
"activities that accord with the spirit of software freedom."

"Any kind of activity could be eligible &mdash; writing software, writing "
"documentation, publishing CDs, even journalism &mdash; but whatever the "
"activity, we want to recognize long-term central contributions to the "
"development of the world of software freedom.  &ldquo;Accord with the "
"spirit&rdquo; means, for example, that software, manuals or collections of "
"them (online or on CD) must be entirely Free.  Work done commercially is "
"eligible, but we give this award to individuals, not to companies, "
"organizations, or teams."

"People such as Miguel de Icaza, Donald Knuth, Larry Lessig, Brian Paul, "

"already received this or other awards for their contributions, are not "
"eligible for the Award for the Advancement of Free Software.  Among those "
"who are eligible, the award committee will try to choose whoever has made "
"the greatest contribution."
