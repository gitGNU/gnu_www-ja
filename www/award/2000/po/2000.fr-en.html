<h3>Description of Award Ceremony</h3>

<p>
The 2000 Free Software Foundation Award Ceremony was held at the
Museum of Jewish Art and History in Paris, France on the evening of 1
February 2001.  The ceremony was sponsored by Aurora, Idealx, and VA
Linux Systems.  The <a href="http://www.april.org">Association for
Promotion and Research in Libre Computing (APRIL)</a>, the French
associate organization of the Free Software Foundation Europe,
organized the ceremony.  Proceeds from the event went to benefit
the <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org">Free Software Foundation
Europe</a>.</p>

<p>
Richard Stallman presented the award, a one-of-a-kind handmade quilt,
to Brian Paul for his ground-breaking work on the Mesa 3D Graphics
Library.</p>

<p>
Brian Paul was chosen from three finalists for the award.  The other
finalists were Donald Becker, for his network device drivers for the
GNU/Linux system and Patrick Lenz for his work on freshmeat.net.</p>

<p>
At the ceremony, additional awards were also distributed.  Georg
C. F. Greve, president designate of the FSF Europe, presented Daniel
Riek with a certificate of appreciation for his seminal funding of the
Free Software Foundation Europe.  Frederic Couchet, president of
APRIL, presented Loic Dachary with an award commemorating his
unwavering support and contributions to free software over the past 14
years.</p>

<a href="/award/2000/2000-pr.txt">A Full press release for the event,
in English, German and French, is available</a>.
<a href="/award/2000/2000-pr.en.txt">English-only</a>,
<a href="/award/2000/2000-pr.fr.txt">French-only</a>,
and <a href="/award/2000/2000-pr.de.txt">German-only</a> versions are
also available.</p>

<h3>Movie of the Ceremony</h3>

<p>
An MPEG-2 movie of the event is available
at <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org/video/.original_files/fsfaward2000.vob">
<code>http://audio-video.gnu.org/</code></a>.  Beware: it is a very
big file (1.1 GB).</p>

<p>
The movie was captured and encoded using free software.  Since it's
not yet mature, no streamed view is available, the stream is somewhat
buggy and you must expect to experience software bugs when reading it.
Hopefully this will encourage developers to build better free software
to capture and display
MPEG-2.  <a href="mailto:christophe.massiot@idealx.com">Christophe
Massiot</a> wrote a
complete description of the capture process.  The movie can be viewed with the
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN</a> Client, version 0.2.5
or later, a solution developed for MPEG-2 streaming on a LAN.</p>

<p>
It's worth mentioning
that <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN</a> was
officially <a href="http://videolan.org/images/paper.jpeg">released
under the GPL</a> by <a href="http://www.ecp.fr/">Ecole Centrale de
Paris</a> for the occasion, after active lobbying from the IDEALX team
and all the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN</a> project
members involved in the operation.</p>
