"The movie was captured and encoded using free software.  Since it's not yet "
"mature, no streamed view is available, the stream is somewhat buggy and you "
"must expect to experience software bugs when reading it.  Hopefully this "
"will encourage developers to build better free software to capture and "
"display MPEG-2.  <a href=\"mailto:christophe.massiot@idealx.com\">Christophe "
"Massiot</a> wrote a complete description of the capture process.  The movie "
